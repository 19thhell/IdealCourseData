Students who satisfactorily complete the course work in this program, which is spread over three summers , are eligible to receive certification endorsed by the Organization of American Kod&aacute;ly Educators for Kod&aacute;ly Levels 1, 2, and 3 . Daily course work meets from 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. and is divided into the following seven subject areas:    Voice Pedagogy (daily, 30 minutes) offers students a thorough warm-up of the voice&mdash;the main musical medium in Kod&aacute;ly-based work. Students learn the physiology of the voice and techniques of posture, breath management, phonation, resonant tone production, diction, and expression. Students also explore activities to use in the classroom appropriate for young voices toward the goal of singing with confidence    Solfege (daily, 75 minutes) develops a teacher's ability to use the tools of the Kod&aacute;ly concept&mdash;movable tonic solfege and rhythm syllables. These tools are used with the development of skills of conducting, inner hearing, dictation, improvisation, and part work. Solfege is divided into three levels.    Kod&aacute;ly Methodology (daily, 75 minutes) introduces the teacher to the philosophy and practice of a Kod&aacute;ly-based curriculum. Supportive traditional song (folk-song) literature, including singing games and dances, is explored toward helping students derive music comparatives (timbre/tone color/tone quality, dynamics, tempo, duration, pitch, texture, articulation), beat, rhythm, meter, pitch patterns, simultaneity, and form&mdash;music literacy. Listening experiences are included in this study. The transition to composed music is made. Students explore curriculum development by writing starting points, song lists, yearly flow charts, daily lesson plans, and activity plans (strategies). Kod&aacute;ly Methodology is divided into three levels.    Chorus (daily, 60 minutes) gives the student experience in choral performance. All choral repertory, much of it a cappella , is rehearsed for a performance at the end of the course.    Traditional (Folk) Materials and Research (daily, 60 minutes) offers the student experience in the areas of traditional (folk) song collecting and analysis and the relating of these skills to the ethnomusicological understanding of music as culture. Students from all three levels of the program meet together to focus on certain topics. Summer 2014 focuses on Culture Studies and World Musics in the Classroom 2: Canada, The Caribbean, Eastern Europe, The Iberian Diaspora, Japan, Korea, The Middle East.    Choral Conducting (M, W, F, 75 minutes) offers the teacher the development and practice of choral conducting techniques, discovery of choral repertory, score strategies, and rehearsal planning. Students practice posture, beat patterns, and signals for expressive singing (dynamics and articulation). Cueing entrances and cut-offs in polyphonic music are studied. Choral Conducting is divided into three levels.    Recorder Pedagogy and Ensembles (TU, TH, 75 minutes, elective) introduces the teacher to the chest of recorders&mdash;an extension of the Kod&aacute;ly concept to instruments. Teachers become proficient in recorder technique, learn teaching practices, and explore ensemble music for performance.    Special Weekend &amp; Evening Activities    New York City offers an exciting field to observe living traditional (folk) music and culture. Kod&aacute;ly students are invited to attend evening and weekend activities that explore various cultural scenes. Past field trips have included visits to an Irish pub to listen to a seisi&uacute;n and to Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience&mdash;activities that situate traditional (folk) studies among living New Yorkers of the twenty-first century.          Two evening workshops in making materials for the Kod&aacute;ly-based classroom.          Lunchtime video reviews of Kod&aacute;ly-based lessons.          Picnic in Washington Square Park.          An evening at South Street Seaport to participate in sea shanties.          An afternoon in Chinatown to have dim sum.          An evening at O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Pub to enjoy an Irish seisi&uacute;n.          Dinner on the Boardwalk at Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience followed by fun at Coney Island.          Closing Concert and Banquet.

Please Note : The Kodaly Summer Institute is open to students as a non-credit course (like most MPAP Summer Programs). However, students may also take the course 3 graduate credits (if qualified).    The Kod&aacute;ly Summer Institute is endorsed by the Organization of American Kod&aacute;ly Educators .    Kod&aacute;ly &amp; Music Education    Following his folk-song collecting with B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k in Hungary in the early 1900s, Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly had a vision&mdash;a monumental idea that music, like language, could be taught artistically using the authentic traditional (folk) materials of any given culture. Gathering talented, creative teachers around him, Kod&aacute;ly developed a philosophy:    Music is at the core of the curriculum. The ancient Greeks believed that music was at the center of all learning, because music was a natural synthesis of thinking, feeling, and moving.    The body&mdash;singing voice, body idiophones, and movement&mdash;is the best medium for making music. The body and the voice are custom made for every individual. Song and movement are united in traditional (folk) games and dances. Singing with confidence is a main goal.    Traditional (folk) musics leading to other musics are the best materials for becoming literate in Western music. Everyone has a mother tongue&mdash;the language spoken at home. The traditional (folk) music of that language should be the song source from which the facts and concepts of music literacy are drawn. In a complex culture, such as that in the United States, any music of a culture group or subculture group should be considered. In Kod&aacute;ly practice the repertory of materials should take four directions:       Preservation of authentic traditional (folk) songs of the native culture(s).    Exploration of musics of other cultures.    Bridging traditional (folk) songs with all styles of composed music.    Exploration of both historical and living traditions.       Music literacy is like language literacy. Everyone has the ability to hear, speak, read, and write a language. Therefore, everyone has the ability to hear, sing, read, and write music. Music literacy is something that everyone can and should enjoy. Music literacy is the first step of analysis toward the goal of musical understanding.    Quality music is the best material for teaching. Kod&aacute;ly believed that only the best music by the greatest composers and traditional (folk) music most representative of the culture are good enough for children.    Experiencing music&mdash;hearing, developing skills, preparing to derive concepts&mdash;cannot begin too early. Kod&aacute;ly said music training should begin \"nine months before the birth of the mother.\"    The Kod&aacute;ly philosophy has been adapted worldwide. Emphasis on the continuing upgrade of the teacher's own musicianship continues to be a strong feature of this movement. It is a living philosophy constantly being reshaped by research in how children learn music in cultural settings. Kod&aacute;ly's vision complements the emerging focus on world musics by today's musician-educators.

Students who satisfactorily complete the course work in this program, which is spread over three summers , are eligible to receive certification endorsed by the Organization of American Kod&aacute;ly Educators for Kod&aacute;ly Levels 1, 2, and 3 . Daily course work meets from 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. and is divided into the following seven subject areas:    Voice Pedagogy (daily, 30 minutes) offers students a thorough warm-up of the voice&mdash;the main musical medium in Kod&aacute;ly-based work. Students learn the physiology of the voice and techniques of posture, breath management, phonation, resonant tone production, diction, and expression. Students also explore activities to use in the classroom appropriate for young voices toward the goal of singing with confidence    Solfege (daily, 75 minutes) develops a teacher's ability to use the tools of the Kod&aacute;ly concept&mdash;movable tonic solfege and rhythm syllables. These tools are used with the development of skills of conducting, inner hearing, dictation, improvisation, and part work. Solfege is divided into three levels.    Kod&aacute;ly Methodology (daily, 75 minutes) introduces the teacher to the philosophy and practice of a Kod&aacute;ly-based curriculum. Supportive traditional song (folk-song) literature, including singing games and dances, is explored toward helping students derive music comparatives (timbre/tone color/tone quality, dynamics, tempo, duration, pitch, texture, articulation), beat, rhythm, meter, pitch patterns, simultaneity, and form&mdash;music literacy. Listening experiences are included in this study. The transition to composed music is made. Students explore curriculum development by writing starting points, song lists, yearly flow charts, daily lesson plans, and activity plans (strategies). Kod&aacute;ly Methodology is divided into three levels.    Chorus (daily, 60 minutes) gives the student experience in choral performance. All choral repertory, much of it a cappella , is rehearsed for a performance at the end of the course.    Traditional (Folk) Materials and Research (daily, 60 minutes) offers the student experience in the areas of traditional (folk) song collecting and analysis and the relating of these skills to the ethnomusicological understanding of music as culture. Students from all three levels of the program meet together to focus on certain topics. Summer 2014 focuses on Culture Studies and World Musics in the Classroom 2: Canada, The Caribbean, Eastern Europe, The Iberian Diaspora, Japan, Korea, The Middle East.    Choral Conducting (M, W, F, 75 minutes) offers the teacher the development and practice of choral conducting techniques, discovery of choral repertory, score strategies, and rehearsal planning. Students practice posture, beat patterns, and signals for expressive singing (dynamics and articulation). Cueing entrances and cut-offs in polyphonic music are studied. Choral Conducting is divided into three levels.    Recorder Pedagogy and Ensembles (TU, TH, 75 minutes, elective) introduces the teacher to the chest of recorders&mdash;an extension of the Kod&aacute;ly concept to instruments. Teachers become proficient in recorder technique, learn teaching practices, and explore ensemble music for performance.    Special Weekend &amp; Evening Activities    New York City offers an exciting field to observe living traditional (folk) music and culture. Kod&aacute;ly students are invited to attend evening and weekend activities that explore various cultural scenes. Past field trips have included visits to an Irish pub to listen to a seisi&uacute;n and to Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience&mdash;activities that situate traditional (folk) studies among living New Yorkers of the twenty-first century.          Two evening workshops in making materials for the Kod&aacute;ly-based classroom.          Lunchtime video reviews of Kod&aacute;ly-based lessons.          Picnic in Washington Square Park.          An evening at South Street Seaport to participate in sea shanties.          An afternoon in Chinatown to have dim sum.          An evening at O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Pub to enjoy an Irish seisi&uacute;n.          Dinner on the Boardwalk at Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience followed by fun at Coney Island.          Closing Concert and Banquet.

The Kod&aacute;ly Summer Institute is endorsed by the Organization of American Kod&aacute;ly Educators .    Kod&aacute;ly &amp; Music Education    Following his folk-song collecting with B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k in Hungary in the early 1900s, Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly had a vision&mdash;a monumental idea that music, like language, could be taught artistically using the authentic traditional (folk) materials of any given culture. Gathering talented, creative teachers around him, Kod&aacute;ly developed a philosophy:    Music is at the core of the curriculum. The ancient Greeks believed that music was at the center of all learning, because music was a natural synthesis of thinking, feeling, and moving.    The body&mdash;singing voice, body idiophones, and movement&mdash;is the best medium for making music. The body and the voice are custom made for every individual. Song and movement are united in traditional (folk) games and dances. Singing with confidence is a main goal.    Traditional (folk) musics leading to other musics are the best materials for becoming literate in Western music. Everyone has a mother tongue&mdash;the language spoken at home. The traditional (folk) music of that language should be the song source from which the facts and concepts of music literacy are drawn. In a complex culture, such as that in the United States, any music of a culture group or subculture group should be considered. In Kod&aacute;ly practice the repertory of materials should take four directions:       Preservation of authentic traditional (folk) songs of the native culture(s).    Exploration of musics of other cultures.    Bridging traditional (folk) songs with all styles of composed music.    Exploration of both historical and living traditions.       Music literacy is like language literacy. Everyone has the ability to hear, speak, read, and write a language. Therefore, everyone has the ability to hear, sing, read, and write music. Music literacy is something that everyone can and should enjoy. Music literacy is the first step of analysis toward the goal of musical understanding.    Quality music is the best material for teaching. Kod&aacute;ly believed that only the best music by the greatest composers and traditional (folk) music most representative of the culture are good enough for children.    Experiencing music&mdash;hearing, developing skills, preparing to derive concepts&mdash;cannot begin too early. Kod&aacute;ly said music training should begin \"nine months before the birth of the mother.\"    The Kod&aacute;ly philosophy has been adapted worldwide. Emphasis on the continuing upgrade of the teacher's own musicianship continues to be a strong feature of this movement. It is a living philosophy constantly being reshaped by research in how children learn music in cultural settings. Kod&aacute;ly's vision complements the emerging focus on world musics by today's musician-educators.

Kod&aacute;ly &amp; Music Education    Following his folk-song collecting with B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k in Hungary in the early 1900s, Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly had a vision&mdash;a monumental idea that music, like language, could be taught artistically using the authentic traditional (folk) materials of any given culture. Gathering talented, creative teachers around him, Kod&aacute;ly developed a philosophy:    Music is at the core of the curriculum. The ancient Greeks believed that music was at the center of all learning, because music was a natural synthesis of thinking, feeling, and moving.    The body&mdash;singing voice, body idiophones, and movement&mdash;is the best medium for making music. The body and the voice are custom made for every individual. Song and movement are united in traditional (folk) games and dances. Singing with confidence is a main goal.    Traditional (folk) musics leading to other musics are the best materials for becoming literate in Western music. Everyone has a mother tongue&mdash;the language spoken at home. The traditional (folk) music of that language should be the song source from which the facts and concepts of music literacy are drawn. In a complex culture, such as that in the United States, any music of a culture group or subculture group should be considered. In Kod&aacute;ly practice the repertory of materials should take four directions:       Preservation of authentic traditional (folk) songs of the native culture(s).    Exploration of musics of other cultures.    Bridging traditional (folk) songs with all styles of composed music.    Exploration of both historical and living traditions.       Music literacy is like language literacy. Everyone has the ability to hear, speak, read, and write a language. Therefore, everyone has the ability to hear, sing, read, and write music. Music literacy is something that everyone can and should enjoy. Music literacy is the first step of analysis toward the goal of musical understanding.    Quality music is the best material for teaching. Kod&aacute;ly believed that only the best music by the greatest composers and traditional (folk) music most representative of the culture are good enough for children.    Experiencing music&mdash;hearing, developing skills, preparing to derive concepts&mdash;cannot begin too early. Kod&aacute;ly said music training should begin \"nine months before the birth of the mother.\"    The Kod&aacute;ly philosophy has been adapted worldwide. Emphasis on the continuing upgrade of the teacher's own musicianship continues to be a strong feature of this movement. It is a living philosophy constantly being reshaped by research in how children learn music in cultural settings. Kod&aacute;ly's vision complements the emerging focus on world musics by today's musician-educators.

Students who satisfactorily complete the course work in this program, which is spread over three summers , are eligible to receive certification endorsed by the Organization of American Kod&aacute;ly Educators for Kod&aacute;ly Levels 1, 2, and 3 . Daily course work meets from 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. and is divided into the following seven subject areas:    Voice Pedagogy (daily, 30 minutes) offers students a thorough warm-up of the voice&mdash;the main musical medium in Kod&aacute;ly-based work. Students learn the physiology of the voice and techniques of posture, breath management, phonation, resonant tone production, diction, and expression. Students also explore activities to use in the classroom appropriate for young voices toward the goal of singing with confidence    Solfege (daily, 75 minutes) develops a teacher's ability to use the tools of the Kod&aacute;ly concept&mdash;movable tonic solfege and rhythm syllables. These tools are used with the development of skills of conducting, inner hearing, dictation, improvisation, and part work. Solfege is divided into three levels.    Kod&aacute;ly Methodology (daily, 75 minutes) introduces the teacher to the philosophy and practice of a Kod&aacute;ly-based curriculum. Supportive traditional song (folk-song) literature, including singing games and dances, is explored toward helping students derive music comparatives (timbre/tone color/tone quality, dynamics, tempo, duration, pitch, texture, articulation), beat, rhythm, meter, pitch patterns, simultaneity, and form&mdash;music literacy. Listening experiences are included in this study. The transition to composed music is made. Students explore curriculum development by writing starting points, song lists, yearly flow charts, daily lesson plans, and activity plans (strategies). Kod&aacute;ly Methodology is divided into three levels.    Chorus (daily, 60 minutes) gives the student experience in choral performance. All choral repertory, much of it a cappella , is rehearsed for a performance at the end of the course.    Traditional (Folk) Materials and Research (daily, 60 minutes) offers the student experience in the areas of traditional (folk) song collecting and analysis and the relating of these skills to the ethnomusicological understanding of music as culture. Students from all three levels of the program meet together to focus on certain topics. Summer 2014 focuses on Culture Studies and World Musics in the Classroom 2: Canada, The Caribbean, Eastern Europe, The Iberian Diaspora, Japan, Korea, The Middle East.    Choral Conducting (M, W, F, 75 minutes) offers the teacher the development and practice of choral conducting techniques, discovery of choral repertory, score strategies, and rehearsal planning. Students practice posture, beat patterns, and signals for expressive singing (dynamics and articulation). Cueing entrances and cut-offs in polyphonic music are studied. Choral Conducting is divided into three levels.    Recorder Pedagogy and Ensembles (TU, TH, 75 minutes, elective) introduces the teacher to the chest of recorders&mdash;an extension of the Kod&aacute;ly concept to instruments. Teachers become proficient in recorder technique, learn teaching practices, and explore ensemble music for performance.    Special Weekend &amp; Evening Activities    New York City offers an exciting field to observe living traditional (folk) music and culture. Kod&aacute;ly students are invited to attend evening and weekend activities that explore various cultural scenes. Past field trips have included visits to an Irish pub to listen to a seisi&uacute;n and to Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience&mdash;activities that situate traditional (folk) studies among living New Yorkers of the twenty-first century.          Two evening workshops in making materials for the Kod&aacute;ly-based classroom.          Lunchtime video reviews of Kod&aacute;ly-based lessons.          Picnic in Washington Square Park.          An evening at South Street Seaport to participate in sea shanties.          An afternoon in Chinatown to have dim sum.          An evening at O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Pub to enjoy an Irish seisi&uacute;n.          Dinner on the Boardwalk at Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience followed by fun at Coney Island.          Closing Concert and Banquet.

Please Note : The Kodaly Summer Institute is open to students as a non-credit course (like most MPAP Summer Programs). However, students may also take the course 3 graduate credits (if qualified).    The Kod&aacute;ly Summer Institute is endorsed by the Organization of American Kod&aacute;ly Educators .    Kod&aacute;ly &amp; Music Education    Following his folk-song collecting with B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k in Hungary in the early 1900s, Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly had a vision&mdash;a monumental idea that music, like language, could be taught artistically using the authentic traditional (folk) materials of any given culture. Gathering talented, creative teachers around him, Kod&aacute;ly developed a philosophy:    Music is at the core of the curriculum. The ancient Greeks believed that music was at the center of all learning, because music was a natural synthesis of thinking, feeling, and moving.    The body&mdash;singing voice, body idiophones, and movement&mdash;is the best medium for making music. The body and the voice are custom made for every individual. Song and movement are united in traditional (folk) games and dances. Singing with confidence is a main goal.    Traditional (folk) musics leading to other musics are the best materials for becoming literate in Western music. Everyone has a mother tongue&mdash;the language spoken at home. The traditional (folk) music of that language should be the song source from which the facts and concepts of music literacy are drawn. In a complex culture, such as that in the United States, any music of a culture group or subculture group should be considered. In Kod&aacute;ly practice the repertory of materials should take four directions:       Preservation of authentic traditional (folk) songs of the native culture(s).    Exploration of musics of other cultures.    Bridging traditional (folk) songs with all styles of composed music.    Exploration of both historical and living traditions.       Music literacy is like language literacy. Everyone has the ability to hear, speak, read, and write a language. Therefore, everyone has the ability to hear, sing, read, and write music. Music literacy is something that everyone can and should enjoy. Music literacy is the first step of analysis toward the goal of musical understanding.    Quality music is the best material for teaching. Kod&aacute;ly believed that only the best music by the greatest composers and traditional (folk) music most representative of the culture are good enough for children.    Experiencing music&mdash;hearing, developing skills, preparing to derive concepts&mdash;cannot begin too early. Kod&aacute;ly said music training should begin \"nine months before the birth of the mother.\"    The Kod&aacute;ly philosophy has been adapted worldwide. Emphasis on the continuing upgrade of the teacher's own musicianship continues to be a strong feature of this movement. It is a living philosophy constantly being reshaped by research in how children learn music in cultural settings. Kod&aacute;ly's vision complements the emerging focus on world musics by today's musician-educators.

Students who satisfactorily complete the course work in this program, which is spread over three summers , are eligible to receive certification endorsed by the Organization of American Kod&aacute;ly Educators for Kod&aacute;ly Levels 1, 2, and 3 . Daily course work meets from 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. and is divided into the following seven subject areas:    Voice Pedagogy (daily, 30 minutes) offers students a thorough warm-up of the voice&mdash;the main musical medium in Kod&aacute;ly-based work. Students learn the physiology of the voice and techniques of posture, breath management, phonation, resonant tone production, diction, and expression. Students also explore activities to use in the classroom appropriate for young voices toward the goal of singing with confidence    Solfege (daily, 75 minutes) develops a teacher's ability to use the tools of the Kod&aacute;ly concept&mdash;movable tonic solfege and rhythm syllables. These tools are used with the development of skills of conducting, inner hearing, dictation, improvisation, and part work. Solfege is divided into three levels.    Kod&aacute;ly Methodology (daily, 75 minutes) introduces the teacher to the philosophy and practice of a Kod&aacute;ly-based curriculum. Supportive traditional song (folk-song) literature, including singing games and dances, is explored toward helping students derive music comparatives (timbre/tone color/tone quality, dynamics, tempo, duration, pitch, texture, articulation), beat, rhythm, meter, pitch patterns, simultaneity, and form&mdash;music literacy. Listening experiences are included in this study. The transition to composed music is made. Students explore curriculum development by writing starting points, song lists, yearly flow charts, daily lesson plans, and activity plans (strategies). Kod&aacute;ly Methodology is divided into three levels.    Chorus (daily, 60 minutes) gives the student experience in choral performance. All choral repertory, much of it a cappella , is rehearsed for a performance at the end of the course.    Traditional (Folk) Materials and Research (daily, 60 minutes) offers the student experience in the areas of traditional (folk) song collecting and analysis and the relating of these skills to the ethnomusicological understanding of music as culture. Students from all three levels of the program meet together to focus on certain topics. Summer 2014 focuses on Culture Studies and World Musics in the Classroom 2: Canada, The Caribbean, Eastern Europe, The Iberian Diaspora, Japan, Korea, The Middle East.    Choral Conducting (M, W, F, 75 minutes) offers the teacher the development and practice of choral conducting techniques, discovery of choral repertory, score strategies, and rehearsal planning. Students practice posture, beat patterns, and signals for expressive singing (dynamics and articulation). Cueing entrances and cut-offs in polyphonic music are studied. Choral Conducting is divided into three levels.    Recorder Pedagogy and Ensembles (TU, TH, 75 minutes, elective) introduces the teacher to the chest of recorders&mdash;an extension of the Kod&aacute;ly concept to instruments. Teachers become proficient in recorder technique, learn teaching practices, and explore ensemble music for performance.    Special Weekend &amp; Evening Activities    New York City offers an exciting field to observe living traditional (folk) music and culture. Kod&aacute;ly students are invited to attend evening and weekend activities that explore various cultural scenes. Past field trips have included visits to an Irish pub to listen to a seisi&uacute;n and to Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience&mdash;activities that situate traditional (folk) studies among living New Yorkers of the twenty-first century.          Two evening workshops in making materials for the Kod&aacute;ly-based classroom.          Lunchtime video reviews of Kod&aacute;ly-based lessons.          Picnic in Washington Square Park.          An evening at South Street Seaport to participate in sea shanties.          An afternoon in Chinatown to have dim sum.          An evening at O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Pub to enjoy an Irish seisi&uacute;n.          Dinner on the Boardwalk at Brighton Beach to sample the Russian American experience followed by fun at Coney Island.          Closing Concert and Banquet.
