New York University\u2019s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at the   Tisch School of the Arts has unveiled a new   state-of-the art production studio and teaching space located off campus   in the Gramercy neighborhood of New York City. The studio, comprising a Live Room and Control Room, measures   approximately 600 sq. ft. and will serve as a new mix/overdub and   teaching facility. It contains a 16-channel Rupert Neve Designs 5088   discrete analog mixing console, and is additionally outfitted with eight   Portico 5032 Mic Pre/Equalizer and eight 5033 5-Band EQ modules in the   console\u2019s penthouse section. The 5088 is integrated into a hybrid setup that combines the   console\u2019s high quality, discrete analog front end, signal processing and   summing buss facilities with an Avid Pro Tools|HD system and Artist Mix   control surface. Analog outboard gear includes high-end units by   Pendulum, Chandler, Universal Audio, and Empirical Labs, as well as   instruments and amps by Fender and Ampeg. Sterling Modular supplied a   leg set and custom monitor stand for the 5088 together with a custom   desk for the Euphonix mix controllers. The new studio occupies the former Studio A within the Soundtrack   Film and Television multi-studio facility in Manhattan. It was a   hit-maker in the 1980s for such well-known music artists as Run D.M.C,   Taylor Dayne, Madonna and Steve Winwood, among others. 21 North Studio Gear List Console \u2022 Rupert Neve Designs 5088 Analog Console o with 8 5032 mic preamp / 3-band equalizer Portico Modules o with 8 5033 5-band equalizer Portico Modules Recorders \u2022 Avid Pro Tools HD-3 system \u2022 Lynx Aurora 16 audio interface \u2022 Benchmark AD/DA converters Controller Euphonix/Avid Artist Mix (16 faders) Outboard \u2022 API 3124+ Microphone Preamps \u2022 John Hardy M-1 Microphone Preamps \u2022 Empirical Labs EL8-X Distressor Compressor (2) \u2022 Pendulum Audio OCL-2 Stereo Compressor/Limiter \u2022 Chandler Ltd TG1 Stereo Limiter \u2022 Universal Audio 1176LN Compressor/Limiter (2) \u2022 Lexicon PCM90 effects processor \u2022 Line 6 Echo Pro effects processor \u2022 Line 6 Filter Pro effects processor Software \u2022 Pro Tools HD \u2022 Logic Pro \u2022 Ableton Live/Suite \u2022 Reason Plug-Ins \u2022 Waves Gold Bundle \u2022 Antares AutoTune \u2022 Synchro Arts VocAlign \u2022 Audio Ease Altiverb Other \u2022 Meyer Sound HD-1 monitors \u2022 Hear Systems 8-channel headphone mixers Microphones and Instruments \u2022 Coles 4038 (2) \u2022 Neumann U87Ai \u2022 Neumann TLM49 \u2026as well as other mics from Josephson, Sennheiser, Shure, and ElectroVoice \u2022 Guitars and Basses by Fender, Taylor, and Gibson \u2022 Amps by Ampeg and Vox                          The Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music Unveils New State-of-the-Art Production Studio  21 North Studio 25 East 21st St., 5th Floor New York, NY 10010           Undergraduate Admissions Graduate Admissions Academic Services Student Life Financial Aid and Scholarships Career Development Counseling Services International Students Incoming Students Graduation Forms What is Special Programs?

In this application, each sensor is linked to a track on Ableton Live through MAX/MSP. Placing a cube of wood on the base of the controller activates a corresponding track. The cubes are stackable, and the more cubes there are on a sensor, the louder the volume of that track. This device can be played as a music instrument, as a live performance tool, a mixing device for engineers. It can be experienced through speakers for a public performance or headphones for a individual experience.     Personal Statement   Interactivity is a mix of gestures and interfaces. We wanted to create a device that puts the emphasis on the gesture, not on the technology. How can we put the user into a special and unique creative mode? How can we build a tool that invites the user to be spontaneous and engaged? We aimed to create a simple, recognizable interface using materials that encourage child-like play.   Background   Our main research was on soft fabric sensors. We discovered and learned how to make them and which fabric is best for the device. We have built our own sensors and created a template that can be shared.   Audience   The target audience is diverse. Any adult or child can play or perform. Musicians can use it as a performance tool, as it acts as a visualization of what is happening on a computer. Sound engineers can use it as a mixing device.   User Scenario   The user is invited to play with wooden cubes to manipulate the volume of a track, or turn that track on and off, using it as a musical instrument. Using the cubes to increase or decrease the volume of a specific track allows the user to visualize the music. The cubes are made of wood and are reminiscent of toy construction blocks, encouraging users to build and play. to put the user into a playing mode. The wooden interface puts the emphasis on the gestures of the user, not on the technology.   Implementation   The physical equalizer is made of a rectangular platform with 6 soft fabric flex sensors and 20 wooden cubes. Each sensor is linked to a music track on Ableton Live. The user stacks the cubes on the sensors to activate the music tracks. The more cubes there are on a sensor, the louder the volume of the track.   Conclusion   We learned how to conceptualize and build a simple user interface that can have multiple uses and purposes. Making simple and clear interfaces is a complex task. We think we succeeded creating a full and entertaining interactive experience with the physical equalizer.            This entry was posted in Physical Equalizer by admin .
