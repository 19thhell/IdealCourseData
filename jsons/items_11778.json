Comparative literature is an innovative major that encourages students to follow their passion for literature by venturing beyond national and disciplinary boundaries. In the spirit of our times, students delve into literature from all over the world and explore its intersections with other media and disciplines, such as cinema studies, art history, philosophy, politics, anthropology, history, linguistics. Comparative literature departmental course offerings include classes in world literature and interdisciplinary studies where students work intensively with a distinguished faculty of scholars in African, Caribbean, Chinese, European and Anglo-American, Latin American, Middle Eastern and Islamic, and Russian and Eastern European literary and cultural studies. At the same time, the major encourages students to take advantage of the rich offerings of courses in other NYU departments or study abroad.    The guidelines of our program allow students great flexibility in shaping a course of study suited to their own intellectual goals. While all students must take four classes originating in the major, our commitment to a global and interdisciplinary outlook means that the remaining six courses required for the major can be taken in other departments or, taking advantage of NYU study abroad opportunities, even on other continents! All students planning to major in Comparative Literature register with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, who works closely with them to develop a coherent sequence of courses suited to their individual interests. Periodical advising sessions with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and a remarkable student-faculty ratio help our students make the most of the wide range of possibilities that define the major.    A comparative literature major could lead to the advanced study of literature at the graduate level but could just as readily be a strong basis for advanced degrees and/or careers in journalism, publishing, international relations, international law, cultural studies, medicine, philosophy, education, public policy, film and entertainment, and the information industries of computer software and the World Wide Web. Student Learning Goals Upon completion of our program, majors are expected to have developed: 1. Advanced research and analytical skills, enabling students not only to perform a comparative examination of a given corpus of works but also to construct their own objects of study in a comparative framework and to select appropriate theoretical and methodological tools for their projects. 2. Knowledge of, and critical engagement with, the main trends in literary and cultural theories and methodologies. Furthermore, students learn about theoretical and philosophical traditions related to the study of literature. 3. Evidence of strong skills in at least one foreign language and literature, confirmed by ability to read and analyze texts in the original language, as well as to follow and develop oral and written arguments in that language. 4. Ability to produce complex oral and written arguments on literary topics from a comparative perspective. 5. A sophisticated understanding of cultural, linguistic, and diachronic differences, grappling with the role of translation as a communicative and interpretive practice. 6. An ability to close read literary texts spanning various traditions, periods, and genres and to relate them to other types of writing and to other arts, disciplines, and cultural practices.

  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com . Before \u00a0Before coming to\u00a0 The New Yorker , she was an editor at\u00a0 The New York Review of Books .\u00a0 Her writing has appeared on the\u00a0 Newyorker.com ,\u00a0 The Paris Review , Tablet, and elsewhere.   \u00a0     \u00a0       Upcoming Events         Program News   Congratulations to:   Laura Smith , Literary Reportage Kristian Jebsen , Magazine   Kristian Jebsen and Laura Smith, graduate students at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Carter Journalism Institute are pleased to announce a fully funded fellowship for students in, and alumni of, the Literary Reportage concentration.\u00a0 The fellowship offers an opportunity to develop a major essay, memoir, or feature piece during a month-long residency. Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

Besides room and board, the Centre gives each writer a private cabin in the forested Leighton Artists\u2019 Colony, and plenty of time to write... I did not want to leave.

Comparative literature is an innovative major that encourages students to follow their passion for literature by venturing beyond national and disciplinary boundaries. In the spirit of our times, students delve into literature from all over the world and explore its intersections with other media and disciplines, such as cinema studies, art history, philosophy, politics, anthropology, history, linguistics. Comparative literature departmental course offerings include classes in world literature and interdisciplinary studies where students work intensively with a distinguished faculty of scholars in African, Caribbean, Chinese, European and Anglo-American, Latin American, Middle Eastern and Islamic, and Russian and Eastern European literary and cultural studies. At the same time, the major encourages students to take advantage of the rich offerings of courses in other NYU departments or study abroad.    The guidelines of our program allow students great flexibility in shaping a course of study suited to their own intellectual goals. While all students must take four classes originating in the major, our commitment to a global and interdisciplinary outlook means that the remaining six courses required for the major can be taken in other departments or, taking advantage of NYU study abroad opportunities, even on other continents! All students planning to major in Comparative Literature register with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, who works closely with them to develop a coherent sequence of courses suited to their individual interests. Periodical advising sessions with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and a remarkable student-faculty ratio help our students make the most of the wide range of possibilities that define the major.    A comparative literature major could lead to the advanced study of literature at the graduate level but could just as readily be a strong basis for advanced degrees and/or careers in journalism, publishing, international relations, international law, cultural studies, medicine, philosophy, education, public policy, film and entertainment, and the information industries of computer software and the World Wide Web. Student Learning Goals Upon completion of our program, majors are expected to have developed: 1. Advanced research and analytical skills, enabling students not only to perform a comparative examination of a given corpus of works but also to construct their own objects of study in a comparative framework and to select appropriate theoretical and methodological tools for their projects. 2. Knowledge of, and critical engagement with, the main trends in literary and cultural theories and methodologies. Furthermore, students learn about theoretical and philosophical traditions related to the study of literature. 3. Evidence of strong skills in at least one foreign language and literature, confirmed by ability to read and analyze texts in the original language, as well as to follow and develop oral and written arguments in that language. 4. Ability to produce complex oral and written arguments on literary topics from a comparative perspective. 5. A sophisticated understanding of cultural, linguistic, and diachronic differences, grappling with the role of translation as a communicative and interpretive practice. 6. An ability to close read literary texts spanning various traditions, periods, and genres and to relate them to other types of writing and to other arts, disciplines, and cultural practices.

  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com . Before \u00a0Before coming to\u00a0 The New Yorker , she was an editor at\u00a0 The New York Review of Books .\u00a0 Her writing has appeared on the\u00a0 Newyorker.com ,\u00a0 The Paris Review , Tablet, and elsewhere.   \u00a0     \u00a0       Upcoming Events         Program News   Congratulations to:   Laura Smith , Literary Reportage Kristian Jebsen , Magazine   Kristian Jebsen and Laura Smith, graduate students at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Carter Journalism Institute are pleased to announce a fully funded fellowship for students in, and alumni of, the Literary Reportage concentration.\u00a0 The fellowship offers an opportunity to develop a major essay, memoir, or feature piece during a month-long residency. Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

This fellowship provided me with the necessary structure, freedom, and support to create a piece that I might not have completed otherwise\u00ad\u2014in my case, a piece of challenging, personal writing.
