(2) Figures of abandonment, of precariousness and of disavowal recur, in the most diverse ways, in a large part of recent literary fiction, reflecting directly or obliquely, depending on the specific case, radical transformations of the political and of the relation between politics and literature.

We will explore these questions in texts by Fernando Vallejo, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alan Pauls and Sylvia Molloy, among others. (2) Figures of abandonment, of precariousness and of disavowal recur, in the most diverse ways, in a large part of recent literary fiction, reflecting directly or obliquely, depending on the specific case, radical transformations of the political and of the relation between politics and literature.

We will explore these questions in texts by Fernando Vallejo, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alan Pauls and Sylvia Molloy, among others. (2) Figures of abandonment, of precariousness and of disavowal recur, in the most diverse ways, in a large part of recent literary fiction, reflecting directly or obliquely, depending on the specific case, radical transformations of the political and of the relation between politics and literature.

Students in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) need to fulfill 4 semesters of language as part of their College Core Curriculum (CORE). They can also fulfill their requirement with several placement exams. In-person placement exams in Spanish and Portuguese will be available for CAS students during the summer and throughout the Fall and Spring semesters: http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.placementexams    Portuguese         Spanish speakers with no formal training of Portuguese can  register directly for PORT UA 11 Portuguese for Spanish  Speakers.      Other students with no training in Portuguese can  register for PORT UA 1 Elementary Portuguese I or PORT UA 10  Intensive Elementary Portuguese.      Students with previous formal training and/or familiarity in Portuguese must  go to the College of Arts and Science\u2019s language exam website and take the  online exam, picking Portuguese among the choices: http://www.nyu.edu/cas/flpexam/ . Students will  receive a score placing them in a certain level and must register for that  level.      Students who score above the cutoff can take a written  in-person exam for exemption from the CORE requirement. They must sign up in  advance for the exemption exam. Information on dates and signing up can be  found at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams .

The course is divided into three modules, each taught by a specialist, that represent three key areas within the field of applied linguistics: 1) An introduction to social and psychological aspects of the study of language; 2) Language learning: how language systems are cognitively internalized and taught; and 3) An overview of applied linguistics in translation studies and theory. The course aims to provide students with the relevant theoretical frameworks needed to pursue these three key areas of linguistic study at graduate level.    Stylistics and Semantics of Written Spanish    SPAN-GA 9108 4 points. 2013-14. The main objective of this course is to reinforce the linguistic foundations for advanced students of Spanish, aiming to improve communicative competence through a systematic study of grammatical, discursive, and pragmatic systems together with a practical study of form, function and usage in Spanish. Students will gain practice on several levels as well as guidance for their own language teaching through: 1) advanced grammar review, with special emphasis on difficult points for native English speakers, 2) identification of different grammatical structures in literary texts and journalism, allowing students to provide their own examples from other course materials, 3) a broadening of students' mastery of Spanish with specific exercises and writing activities based on textual models.    Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language    SPAN-GA 9201 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course comprises a weekly three-hour seminar combined with observations of \"Spanish as a second language (ELE)\" classes from NYU Madrid's undergraduate program. The practical component is supplemented through English Teaching Assistantships in local schools. All seminars are developed through lectures, peer commentary, and practical examples providing an overview of theories in pedagogy to be elaborated upon in future coursework. Students will prepare didactic activities, a teaching portfolio with a Statement of Teaching Philosophy, and a final written work for the course, as well as share their work with their peers in oral presentations in Spanish. Seminars will cover the following aspects of language teaching: communicative competence; new approaches to teaching grammar; acquisition of pragmatic competence; teaching culture and intercultural issues; the development of different linguistic skills (auditory, oral, written, reading comprehension); correction of errors; and language level assessment. The hours allocated to fieldwork include student collection and analysis of field data.    Applied Methodology for Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language    SPAN-GA 9202 4 points. 2013-14. This course follows the Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language course offered in the Fall semester as a continued study of materials, approaches, and techniques used to teach language skills to second and foreign language learners while applying language acquisition theories to practice. In addition, this course emphasizes practical issues of day-to-day lesson planning to develop teaching skills, plus different methods for promoting student motivation and positive reinforcement through classroom communication. All students will observe one another's student teaching and subsequently discuss the experience together in class. A range of 3 undergraduate courses at NYU Madrid\u2014at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels\u2014will be used to offer the MA students teaching experience.    Advanced Workshop in Contemporary Hispanic Issues    SPAN-GA 9203 4 points. 2013-14.

Hispanic Dialectology and Sociolinguistics    SPAN-GA 9208 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course provides a comprehensive overview of different factors that influence geographic and sociolinguistic variation in Spanish. In addition to geographic variation, students will explore gender- and age-based linguistic differences, as well as sociolinguistic variants due to social and cultural factors in Spain, Latin America, and the United States. Students will be introduced to theoretical and methodological concepts of dialectal, social, and linguistic variants in research on language contact. Through this analysis, the course will explore language as a source of cultural identity. Students will conduct their own research on specific varieties of Spanish and their social context for a final paper and will be expected to present a portion of this material and participate actively in class discussions.    Translation of Literary, Legal, Medical, and Business Texts    SPAN-GA 9301 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to introduce students to translation theory by working through relevant readings and, above all, practical exercises in translating literary, legal, medical and business texts. In this way, students will become familiar with the use of translation instruments (dictionaries, maps, etc.) and translation techniques (borrowing, the decision to translate proper nouns, transposition, etc.), confronting problems associated with both direct and inverse translation. These include: translating groups and clich\u00e9s; differences in customs, civilization, and culture; literal\" translation; adaptations; and casual and intentional historical allusions. Throughout the course students will have the opportunity to work on different kinds of texts related to Spain and Latin America.    Cervantes: Don Quijote    SPAN-GA 9472 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The Quijote is one of the most renowned and read works in the world, and its ability to generate critical literature seems to have no limits. In Cervantes' work, the reader assumes the role of interpreter, with both writing and reading subjected to revisions which transform the idea of literature and the fiction it represents. Students will address questions posed by the critical canon and recent studies: the Quijote as the first modern novel; its transgression of works that came before it; its inscription in a category of burlesque, humorous literature; its ability to appropriate nearly all literary models from its time. The course will situate Cervantes within the history of ideas in order to approach vital questions such as the ethical value of good intentions resolved with negative effects; the construction of identity; the dispersion and agony of the subject; reality conceived as a limitless text; the function of objects and their nominalization.    Introduction to Textual Criticism    SPAN-GA 9555 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to provide students with a graduate-level introduction to criticism by studying Spanish and Latin American texts and writing analytical academic essays.

Topics in Art History: The Power of Images in Spain and Its American Viceroyalties, 16th-18th Centuries    SPAN-GA 9990 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The colonization of Spanish America in the 16th century coincided with the rise of the power of images throughout Counter-Reformation Europe. This course looks at images, and especially paintings, as instruments of persuasion on both sides of the Atlantic. Through a series of thematic units, students will learn about the various roles that images played in all spheres of life from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Special emphasis will be placed on how paintings helped forge identities, both individual and collective, and how the same types of images could transmit different ideas depending on audience and setting. The two central aims of the course are for students to gain a greater awareness of how images are not mere illustrations of history but, on the contrary, themselves construct historical discourse; and secondly, of how cultural transfer\u2014the imposition of Spanish culture on Spanish America\u2014was accompanied by complex processes of adaptation and transformation. The course will include class visits to local museums and collections, including the Prado Museum, the convent of the Descalzas Reales, and the Museo de Am\u00e9rica, preceded by a session on how museums construct history.
