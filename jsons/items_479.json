About the Course    This class is designed as a follow-up to A22.00004, &quot;Computers in Principle and Practice I,&quot; which examined basic computer principles, theory and history, and also explored word processing spreadsheets, beg browsing and basic Web authoring.    This second course will feature an in-depth exploration of Web authoring techniques, as well as a continued study of basic computer principles and current developments in the computer industry. In essence, this class will teach the essentials to become a &quot;Web Master,&quot; a position and profession which is not only exciting and lucrative, but also one which is constantly changing day-by-day, week-by-week. Thus, great stress will be placed upon how to capitalize and expand in the future upon the knowledge garnered from the class.    In order to take this course, you need to have completed Computers in Principle and Practice I (A22.0004), and have either completed one semester of programming (such as A22.0002 or V22.0101) or have equivalent programming experience in a high level programming language such as Pascal, C, ADA or FORTRAN.    III. Mandatory Course Materials    A. Books      1. HTML for the World Wide Web (2nd  Edition)   Visual Quickstart Guide   by Elizabeth Castro   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-68862-X, $17.95     2. Photoshop 4 for Macintosh (***new edition***)   Visual Quickstart Guide   by Elaine Weinmann and Peter Lourekas   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-68841-7, $19.95     3. Director 6 Demystified (***new book***)   by Jason Roberts   Peachpit Press/Macromedia   ISBN 0-201-68884-0, $49.95     4. JavaScript for the World Wide Web (2nd Ed.) (***new edition***)   Visual Quickstart Guide   by Tom Negrino and Dori Smith   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-69648-7, $17.95    In addition to the above required books, there will probably be a required book on a specific version of Java (TBA) that we will be exploring.    B. Current Publications    Part of this course is to expose you to the exciting, current developments in the world of computers and the Internet, especially in the areas of technology, business, copyright, civil liberties, privacy and encryption. To that end, you will be asked to read the articles in every Monday's New York Times Business Section, and the articles in every Tuesday's New York Times Science Section. These will be discussed in class, and form the basis of test questions. These articles are also available on the Times' Web site (http://www.nytimes.com) for a period of about two weeks from the time of publication.    C. Internet Resources    In addition to the New York Times Web site, there are also a great number of other Web sites that cover current information about the computer industry. Further, there are many, many Web sites which are devoted to supplying information, resources and tools to Web Masters. A particularly important part of the course will involve the &quot;deconstruction&quot; of existing Web sites of note. In the final analysis, this may be the most fruitful method of discovering new information about Web authoring.     There will be a Home Page for this course at:     http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring98/A22.0005/index.html    Please mark this page on your Bookmark menu for easy access. You can also get to this page perhaps more easily by following the link at the Computer Science Department's Home Page:     http://cs.nyu.edu    D. Media    You will need to purchase at least two Zip Drive cartridges for your work. (The second one is necessary to serve as a backup for your files!) A Zip cartridge holds 100MB -- approximately 70 floppy disks worth of information, and can be purchased for under $16. This will be necessary because of the size of the files we will be creating. All of the Mac machines in the MultiMedia lab are equipped with this new type of drive.    IV. Additional textbooks    The following additional books could be very helpful:      5. PageMill 2 for Macintosh   Visual Quickstart Guide   by Maria Langer   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-69402-6, $15.95     6. The Non-Designer's Web Book   by Robin Williams and John Tollett   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-68859-X, $29.95     7. Designing Web Graphics (2nd Edition)   by Lynda Weinmann   New Riders Publishing   ISBN 1-56205-715-4, $55.00    V. Software    There are several major commercial software packages that will be used during the course: Netscape Communicator (version 4.0 or above), Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 4.0 or above), Adobe PageMill and SiteMill (version 2.0) and Macromedia Director and SoundEdit (version 6.0). All of these programs are available for use in the ACF Education Lab on the Apple Macintosh platform. Note that all of these programs are also available commercially for Windows 95 platform. Also note that we will probably also explore Symantec Visual Cafe 2.0 for Java.    If you have a home computer running one of these operating systems, and if you wish to purchase this software for either the Mac or Windows, they are available at the education price at the NYU bookstore by showing your student ID. We repeat it is NOT necessary for you to purchase any software. However, if you wish to work on the assignments outside of the labs, then you will need access to a personal computer and the software packages.    In addition to the above commercial software, we will also be using several public domain and shareware programs.    VI. Computer Accounts    There are three accounts which you will have:      1. The first is a UNIX account on the  ACF5 machine. You probably already have a UNIX account on an  &quot;IS&quot; machine, but this new one will allow us to use  a larger storage space, and have access to &quot;CGI&quot; programs.  Your Web pages for this class will go on the machine. Please  register immediately for this account.   2. The second account is for the &quot;MultiMedia  Macs.&quot; You were automatically set up with this account when  you registered for this course.   3. If you wish to use the Web from  home, a PPP/DIAL account is available to you as a member of this  class.      VII. Grading    Your greatest reward is the knowledge and experience that you receive by taking the course. You will also receive a grade. The assignments (see below) will count for 50% of the grade. The midterm will count for 20%, and the final exam counts for the remaining 30%.    VIII. Assignments    There will be five or six assignments during the semester, all of some length, and all to be posted on the Web. Severe penalties may be assessed for late homework. All work must be your own. Remember that your assignments will be posted for all the world to see!    IX. Using the Computer Facilities    You will be using the MultiMedia rooms at the Education Building ACF Laboratory (35 W. 4th St., 2nd floor) for this class.    You will find two types of consultants at the lab: Academic Computing Facility (ACF) consultants who will be able to give help of a general nature, and two consultants hired by the Computer Science Department specifically for this course and for the first semester Computers in Principle and Practice course. The limited hours of these two consultants will be announced later.    X. Topics    The &quot;Practice&quot; part of this course will cover:      Current Web Theory and Practice   Advanced HTML   Adobe Photoshop   Advanced Macromedia Director and Lingo   Sound, Movies and Animation on the  Web   CGI and PERL Scripting   JavaScript   Java      Good luck this semester! I believe this to be one of the most exciting moments in history as we witness the birth of a new means of communication. I hope this course will be of great benefit to you as we enter this New Age, and will help provide you with a roadmap to this constantly changing environment.

About the Course    This class is designed as a follow-up to A22.00004, &quot;Computers in Principle and Practice I,&quot; which examined basic computer principles, theory and history, and also explored word processing spreadsheets, beg browsing and basic Web authoring.    This second course will feature an in-depth exploration of Web authoring techniques, as well as a continued study of basic computer principles and current developments in the computer industry. In essence, this class will teach the essentials to become a &quot;Web Master,&quot; a position and profession which is not only exciting and lucrative, but also one which is constantly changing day-by-day, week-by-week. Thus, great stress will be placed upon how to capitalize and expand in the future upon the knowledge garnered from the class.    In order to take this course, you need to have completed Computers in Principle and Practice I (A22.0004), and have either completed one semester of programming (such as A22.0002 or V22.0101) or have equivalent programming experience in a high level programming language such as Pascal, C, ADA or FORTRAN.    III. Mandatory Course Materials    A. Books      1. HTML for the World Wide Web (2nd  Edition)   Visual Quickstart Guide   by Elizabeth Castro   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-68862-X, $17.95     2. Photoshop 4 for Macintosh (***new edition***)   Visual Quickstart Guide   by Elaine Weinmann and Peter Lourekas   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-68841-7, $19.95     3. Director 6 Demystified (***new book***)   by Jason Roberts   Peachpit Press/Macromedia   ISBN 0-201-68884-0, $49.95     4. JavaScript for the World Wide Web (2nd Ed.) (***new edition***)   Visual Quickstart Guide   by Tom Negrino and Dori Smith   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-69648-7, $17.95    In addition to the above required books, there will probably be a required book on a specific version of Java (TBA) that we will be exploring.    B. Current Publications    Part of this course is to expose you to the exciting, current developments in the world of computers and the Internet, especially in the areas of technology, business, copyright, civil liberties, privacy and encryption. To that end, you will be asked to read the articles in every Monday's New York Times Business Section, and the articles in every Tuesday's New York Times Science Section. These will be discussed in class, and form the basis of test questions. These articles are also available on the Times' Web site (http://www.nytimes.com) for a period of about two weeks from the time of publication.    C. Internet Resources    In addition to the New York Times Web site, there are also a great number of other Web sites that cover current information about the computer industry. Further, there are many, many Web sites which are devoted to supplying information, resources and tools to Web Masters. A particularly important part of the course will involve the &quot;deconstruction&quot; of existing Web sites of note. In the final analysis, this may be the most fruitful method of discovering new information about Web authoring.     There will be a Home Page for this course at:     http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring98/A22.0005/index.html    Please mark this page on your Bookmark menu for easy access. You can also get to this page perhaps more easily by following the link at the Computer Science Department's Home Page:     http://cs.nyu.edu    D. Media    You will need to purchase at least two Zip Drive cartridges for your work. (The second one is necessary to serve as a backup for your files!) A Zip cartridge holds 100MB -- approximately 70 floppy disks worth of information, and can be purchased for under $16. This will be necessary because of the size of the files we will be creating. All of the Mac machines in the MultiMedia lab are equipped with this new type of drive.    IV. Additional textbooks    The following additional books could be very helpful:      5. PageMill 2 for Macintosh   Visual Quickstart Guide   by Maria Langer   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-69402-6, $15.95     6. The Non-Designer's Web Book   by Robin Williams and John Tollett   Peachpit Press   ISBN 0-201-68859-X, $29.95     7. Designing Web Graphics (2nd Edition)   by Lynda Weinmann   New Riders Publishing   ISBN 1-56205-715-4, $55.00    V. Software    There are several major commercial software packages that will be used during the course: Netscape Communicator (version 4.0 or above), Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 4.0 or above), Adobe PageMill and SiteMill (version 2.0) and Macromedia Director and SoundEdit (version 6.0). All of these programs are available for use in the ACF Education Lab on the Apple Macintosh platform. Note that all of these programs are also available commercially for Windows 95 platform. Also note that we will probably also explore Symantec Visual Cafe 2.0 for Java.    If you have a home computer running one of these operating systems, and if you wish to purchase this software for either the Mac or Windows, they are available at the education price at the NYU bookstore by showing your student ID. We repeat it is NOT necessary for you to purchase any software. However, if you wish to work on the assignments outside of the labs, then you will need access to a personal computer and the software packages.    In addition to the above commercial software, we will also be using several public domain and shareware programs.    VI. Computer Accounts    There are three accounts which you will have:      1. The first is a UNIX account on the  ACF5 machine. You probably already have a UNIX account on an  &quot;IS&quot; machine, but this new one will allow us to use  a larger storage space, and have access to &quot;CGI&quot; programs.  Your Web pages for this class will go on the machine. Please  register immediately for this account.   2. The second account is for the &quot;MultiMedia  Macs.&quot; You were automatically set up with this account when  you registered for this course.   3. If you wish to use the Web from  home, a PPP/DIAL account is available to you as a member of this  class.      VII. Grading    Your greatest reward is the knowledge and experience that you receive by taking the course. You will also receive a grade. The assignments (see below) will count for 50% of the grade. The midterm will count for 20%, and the final exam counts for the remaining 30%.    VIII. Assignments    There will be five or six assignments during the semester, all of some length, and all to be posted on the Web. Severe penalties may be assessed for late homework. All work must be your own. Remember that your assignments will be posted for all the world to see!    IX. Using the Computer Facilities    You will be using the MultiMedia rooms at the Education Building ACF Laboratory (35 W. 4th St., 2nd floor) for this class.    You will find two types of consultants at the lab: Academic Computing Facility (ACF) consultants who will be able to give help of a general nature, and two consultants hired by the Computer Science Department specifically for this course and for the first semester Computers in Principle and Practice course. The limited hours of these two consultants will be announced later.    X. Topics    The &quot;Practice&quot; part of this course will cover:      Current Web Theory and Practice   Advanced HTML   Adobe Photoshop   Advanced Macromedia Director and Lingo   Sound, Movies and Animation on the  Web   CGI and PERL Scripting   JavaScript   Java      Good luck this semester! I believe this to be one of the most exciting moments in history as we witness the birth of a new means of communication. I hope this course will be of great benefit to you as we enter this New Age, and will help provide you with a roadmap to this constantly changing environment.
