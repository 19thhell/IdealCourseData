One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which  gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually  stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished  professors drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from  NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional,  cultural, and governmental leaders. In spring 2005, the College  of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which  extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors  Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small  classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the  wider New York community. In some instances students may count the  classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this  appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives. Advanced  Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact  with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to  challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis  and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct  their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an  environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students  and faculty alike. \u2014Dean Matthew S. Santirocco Course Descriptions    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 72828) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of  the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court\u2019s  interpretation and application of the Constitution have adversely  affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of  government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation  of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \u201cImperial  Judiciary.\u201d Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted  properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the  face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them,  and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the  Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines  current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis  and the Court\u2019s participation in the debate. Topics include abortion,  euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights,  gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; college  speech codes, including \u201chate\u201d speech and symbolic speech; and racial  and ethnic profiling. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court  cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the  political spectrum. Students are expected to apply critical thinking to  the topics. Alan J. Pomerantz, Esq.,   is a practicing lawyer and partner of Orrick, Herrington &amp;  Sutcliffe, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School  of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree  from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and  taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of  Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepci\u00f3n  (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He  has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on  legal topics and is recognized in the International Who\u2019s Who\u2014Lawyers .  Mr. Pomerantz has participated in important and controversial matters  affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of  public artistic expression, right of privacy for acts of consenting  adults, and numerous free speech cases.

Greenberg Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. In  the aftermath of 9/11, the United States launched a \u201cwar on terror\u201d and  in so doing challenged some of the basic assumptions of American  domestic and international policy. In the name of security, the powers  of the presidency, the nature of the courts, the role of the media, and  the limits of internationalism have come under scrutiny. This seminar  explores the questions that have come to the fore in the war on terror  and seeks to place them in historical context. The course will address,  among other topics, the balance between security and liberty,  Guantanamo Bay, detention and the roles of the Office of the Vice  President, Department of Justice, Department of Defense, Department of  State, and the effectiveness of the United States as a partner in the  global war on terror. The course considers the changes that may be  required by a 21st century in which the emergence of security as a  vital concern has come to dominate questions of policy and philosophy. Karen J. Greenberg, Executive Director of the Center on Law and Security at the NYU School of Law, is the editor of the NYU Review of Law and Security . She co-edited The Enemy Combatant Papers: American Justice, the Courts, and the War on Terror; The Torture Papers: The Road to Abu Ghraib ; and is the editor of Al Qaeda Now and The Torture Debate in America . She is a frequent contributor on security issues for national publications. Origins of World War I (V28.0128; call # 72832) Instructor: Stewart A. Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  course explores the instability of the European state system in the  pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining  the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak  of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and  the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various  diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in  the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various  interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan  crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German  naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence,  the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal  responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict,  and the attempts to contain it. May be counted toward the major in History.  Stewart A. Stehlin   is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the  development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th  centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic  history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on  European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history,  especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866\u20131890, a translation of Friedrich Ratzel\u2019s Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican, German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919\u20131933 .

Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V28.0129; call # 75298) Instructor: Michael A. Westerman Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. There  are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between  individual-centered models of the person and interpersonal ones. The  seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these  unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a  long-standing fundamental question philosophers began wondering about  centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence\u2014what  place do our relationships with other people have in our lives?  Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic  interplay between psychological considerations and philosophical ones.  Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas  where these tensions appear, including models of child development,  approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy.  We also consider more \u201cinterpersonal\u201d versus more individual-centered  ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction  itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences.  We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers  suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of  psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout  the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions  by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which  contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person  from our philosophical tradition. Students who have taken V50.0247 may not register for this seminar. Michael A. Westerman   is Associate Professor of Psychology. He also holds a Consulting  Faculty appointment in the Department of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral  Sciences at Beth Israel Medical Center. His area of expertise is  clinical psychology. He has conducted research on several topics  concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of  mother-child interaction, family systems, and the patient-therapist  relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles  on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a  program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of  psychological defenses he has developed that is called the theory of  interpersonal defense. Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 72834) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and  thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion  today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal,  medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and  gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both\u2014indeed,  sometimes several\u2014sides of the issues involved. We will also look at  the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary  literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for  civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue. Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz   is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative  Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  She has published widely on many aspects of medieval literature and  culture. She has also been researching and writing about abortion for  several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about  abortion, entitled \u201cVoices,\u201d in New York and Washington, D.C. \u201cVarieties of Religious Experience\u201d Revisited (V28.0144; call # 72836) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. This  seminar will utilize but also update William James\u2019s pioneering  approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological  rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d  is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a  wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different  stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the  phenomenon of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism,  totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or  distort modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill  the vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal,  and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their  credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political  religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them  with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in  which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious  expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the  modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The  seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which  the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality  will need to occur.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was Transformed (V28.0147; call # 72839) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all  too familiar to us in the 20th century. It was a time of the Black  Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time  of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in  the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman  Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious  authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era,  there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms,  vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense  consequence for all of Europe . . . and for our own culture. Through  the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the  beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of  Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian  painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and  art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century  that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most  terrible of all the centuries before the 20th. May be counted toward the major in History.  Jill N. Claster   is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages.  She has served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as  Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been  the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great  Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU. She is currently  working on a book about the Crusades. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (V28.0149; call # 72841) Instructor: Jing Wang Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao  Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional  form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a  vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded  as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a  synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the  tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan  in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores  the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love  and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and  destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the  excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if  hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate  plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable  characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all  times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. Jing Wang   is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and  the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was  Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s (2002).

Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and  the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and  comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to  literary translations, she also publishes personal essays. Civil War at Rome (V28.0153; call # 75602) Instructor: Mich\u00e8le Lowrie Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  course examines the rich literature documenting the civil wars that  tore apart the Roman Republic in the first century BCE and the empire  in the first century CE. Contemporary and later writing of history,  epic, elegy, and lyric poetry finds civil war a defining experience for  Roman identity. The legend about Romulus and Remus puts fratricide at  the center of the city\u2019s foundation. The expanding empire found former  enemies drawn within, so that what previously was a war between city  states took on the coloring of civil contention retrospectively once  these areas were unified. Different sides elevate their leaders as  heroes in a cascading sequence: Caesar versus Pompey, Brutus and  Cassius versus Caesar, Antony and Octavian versus Brutus, Octavian  versus Antony. But what do the leaders stand for? Why does civil war  become a paradigm for thinking about the state? Is social violence the  reason Roman literature is obsessed with politics? We will examine the  differences between sedition, conspiracy, and civil war through the  writings of Cicero, Caesar, Sallust, Vergil, Horace, Propertius, Livy,  Lucan, Tacitus, and Suetonius along with selections from the Greek  historians Plutarch and Appian. All materials will be read in English  translation. May be counted toward the major in Classics.  Mich\u00e8le Lowrie,   Associate Professor of Classics, teaches classes ranging from  elementary language to advanced graduate seminars. She specializes in  the literature of Republican and Augustan Rome and has published on the  majority of authors represented in the course, including a monograph on  Horace and an edited volume on the reception of Vergil. Current  research interests are ancient conceptions of foundation and  sovereignty, the role of the exemplum   as a figure that tells consequential narratives, and national identity.  The reception of Rome in modern literature and political thought is an  abiding concern. She recently organized a conference on this topic at  the University of Konstanz in Germany. Forthcoming are another  monograph, Writing, Performance, and Authority in Augustan Rome, and an anthology of articles on Horace. Transdisciplinary Investigations across Multiple Evolutionary Scales (V28.0154; call # 75429) Instructor: Tyler Volk Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  TIMES seminar will take on the basis of pattern itself across the  scales of nature and mind, and search for common functional principles  in those patterns. The guiding context is the fact that evolution as a  form-generating process, in the general sense, occurs on multiple  scales, such as biological (theory of evolution), cultural (invention  and social selection), and cognition (learning and directed  creativity). All these scales have unique but also similar subprocesses  of replication, variation, and selection. Therefore, where the  functional advantages of certain general solutions are the same to the  challenges of existence on different scales, we should expect to find  common patterns as those solutions. Students will find this an exciting  area of inquiry, and are expected to enlarge their intellectual  horizons as they engage in self-directed research in the context of a  diverse group. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to enroll.    Tyler Volk is Associate Professor of Biology and also Director of Science in the new Environmental Studies Program. He is author of Metapatterns across Space, Time, and Mind ,  as well as of recent papers that elucidate the reasons for the  generation of common functional principles at different scales. He has  also looked at death as a functional aspect of life on multiple scales,  from bacteria to human psychology, in his book What Is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life \u2014and  so this view of transdisciplinary patterns has implications for  building bridges of understanding across scales. He is now working on a  project called \u201cthe evolution of gods.\u201d From Adam and Eve to the Trial of Jesus: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative (V28.0155; call # 75348) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m. The  Bible, as one of the foundational texts of Western civilization, is a  gallery of lively episodes that stimulate, nurture, or otherwise  challenge our sense and value of justice and injustice. Its  full-blooded characters gush forth with all their imperfections, and  their arresting lives present specimens of ethical problems that we  continue to confront in our everyday lives. In this course students  examine legal, moral, and normative existential issues embodied in the  dramas of such characters. In light of their episodes, themes that have  relevance to contemporary issues\u2014such as \u201caxis of evil,\u201d \u201ccommunal  responsibility,\u201d \u201cecological crisis,\u201d \u201cethics vs. religion,\u201d  \u201cgenocide,\u201d \u201choly war,\u201d \u201claw and ruler,\u201d \u201cthe Other,\u201d \u201creligious  intolerance,\u201d \u201csanctity of human life,\u201d and \u201csexual temptation and  moral obligation\u201d\u2014will be thoroughly scrutinized. Readings will cover  some key texts on the notion(s) of justice, readings from the Bible and  selected bibliographies for each of the biblical episodes. Students  will acquire tools to differentiate and hone their understanding of the  meaning of \u201cjustice\u201d and be challenged to reconsider, both critically  and creatively, their assumptions and apprehension of moral  responsibility, and ultimately, their own worldview and  self-understanding through a rereading of passages from the Bible. The  seminar will be taught at the Law School by law school methods  (\u201cSocratic\u201d interactive) and standards\u2014rigorous but academically and  intellectually rewarding. May be counted toward the major in Religious Studies or in Jewish History and Civilization.  J. H. H. Weiler   is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law  School. He serves as Director of The Straus Institute for the Advanced  Study of Law &amp; Justice and The Tikvah Center for Law and Jewish  Civilization. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law  School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and the Jean Monnet  Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy  of Arts and Sciences. He is the Editor-in-Chief of The European Journal of International Law . His recent publications include Un Europa Cristiana (translated into nine languages), The Constitution of Europe (translated into seven languages), and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann . Reconstructing World Violence: A Hobbesian Approach (V28.0156; call # 75320) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday: 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Humans  are as violent as any creature, but we have something in abundance that  others may lack: the ability to sustain and glorify our violence by  justifying it. After attempting to develop coherent accounts of this  phenomenon, students in this seminar consider ways in which pacifist  systems of thought have interacted with violent systems of  justification, often but not always with genocidal results. It was in  the midst of such a violent crisis that Hobbes initiated what remains  an undeveloped approach. If one can extrapolate from Hobbes\u2019s  nationalist agenda and redirect his approach in a democratic way, one  can arrive (as many have) at the following claim: only when globally  sovereign conflict-resolving institutions are fully authorized will any  subordinate system justifying violence lose its force and coherence,  except in the case of violent revolutionary movements which challenge  the global authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling  attempts to operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of  this claim not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its  implications or suspect its grounding. William Klein   teaches social foundations in NYU\u2019s Liberal Studies Program. In the  College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse  Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to  NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught  the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics,  from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under  a pen name) modern crime. Don Quixote (V28.0157; call # 75428) Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. This seminar explores the privileged position of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote   as first modern novel while also attending to the historical and  literary contexts from which it emerged. On one hand, our close reading  of Don Quixote considers how it is a work of recycling and crisis that  incorporates, parodies, and transforms all previous literary \u2014and many  non-literary\u2014 discourses to invent a new narrative form that does not  subscribe to any single poetics. On the other hand, this seminar  attempts to contextualize Cervantes\u2019s work within its historical  moment. To this end we consider some of the most important social,  political, economic, religious and cultural debates and institutions of  Renaissance Europe including Inquisition, imperial expansion, and  political and economic decline. We also explore questions of madness,  erotic and literary desire, authorship, subjectivity, the seductions  and the dangers of reading, the status of representation, translation,  literal vision versus literary visions, the workings of gender, race,  class and nation, and the tenuous frontiers between fiction and  history. The seminar is conducted in  English. Students may read the text in English (using Edith Grossman\u2019s  acclaimed translation) or in the original Spanish. May be counted  toward the major in Spanish or in Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  Georgina Dopico Black is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and Editor of the Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies. She is the author of Perfect Wives, Other Women: Adultery and Inquisition in Early Modern Spain (2001), winner of the MLA\u2019s Katherine Singer Kovacs Prize and of Yale\u2019s Heyman Award. She has co-edited Suplemento al Tesoro de la lengua espa\u00f1ola de Sebasti\u00e1n de Covarrubias (2001), as well as two books on Cervantes: En un lugar de la Mancha (1999) and USA Cervantes (2008). Her current projects include one book on Don Quixote, another  on bodies and methods of truth production in the early modern period,  and a cultural history of medieval and Renaissance Spain. She has also  published articles on the morisco expulsion, the first Spanish  dictionary, Renaissance libraries, Inquisitorial torture, prostitution,  relics, and questions of national definition. The New York Dance Scene: Performance and Criticism Today (V28.0158; call # 75427) Instructor: Jennifer Homans Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  course offers a tour of today\u2019s dance scene in New York. We attend and  discuss performances ranging from classical ballet to \u201ccutting edge\u201d  contemporary dance. But seeing is only the beginning. Students also  study the historical roots of each performance we attend and read about  the artists involved (dancers and choreographers but also musicians and  designers). We evaluate each performance critically and historically,  and situate it within the larger cultural debates of our time. We study  classical ballet in its traditional and contemporary forms through  performances by New York City Ballet and Armitage Gone! Our examination  of the current state of American modern dance takes us to performances  at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Dance Theater Workshop, and the  Baryshnikov Arts Center, among others. Students attend performances  every other week; the interim week is devoted to discussion and  analysis. In preparation for class, students read historical  background, biographies, and criticism, and each student prepares an  in-class presentation relating to the performances we attend. In  consultation with the instructor, students also select a topic or  artist for a final extended essay. Jennifer Homans is the dance critic for the New Republic   and a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at New York University. She  holds a Ph.D. in Modern European History, and her forthcoming book, Classical Ballet: A New History ,  is a cultural history that follows ballet from its origins in  17th-century France to the present. Her articles have also appeared in  the New York Times and the New York Review of Books.   In her previous career, she was a professional dancer, trained in  ballet, modern, and jazz techniques. She performed with the Chicago  Lyric Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet  and has danced a wide repertory, ranging from the ballet classics to  works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and other contemporary  choreographers. The Pastness of the Present: Exploring \u201cHistorically Informed Performance\u201d and \u201cHistorically Involved Composition\u201d (V28.0159; call # 75642) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. How  have performers of notated Western musics resolved the interpretive  dilemmas that result from performing musics which arose amidst distant  historical conditions and traditions? Tracing 19th- and 20th-century  answers to this question, students will explore the historically  informed performance movement in music studies. Concurrently, we will  consider what this movement\u2019s hypotheses and ethics might reveal if  used as a framework for viewing composers\u2019 confrontations with past  style practices. The ultimate goal of the course is to give students a  new set of questions with which to interrogate musical culture in the  21st century, and an intellectual framework with which to formulate  their own responses and experience. Case studies will be drawn from the  baroque period and the 19th and 20th centuries, and will include  selected examples of recent popular musics. The course should be of  interest to students majoring in music, history, philosophy, and other  disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. There are no prerequisites for this course. Ability to read music is strongly suggested, but is not required. Elizabeth Hoffman,   Associate Professor of Music, is the recipient of a Golden Dozen  Teaching Award. Her research interests include theories of tuning;  timbrally and texturally driven media forms; rhythmic complexity;  theories of notation and interpretation; aesthetics; the impact of  technology on creative thought; and the involvement of women in the  field of music composition. In addition to acoustic music, she composes  electroacoustic music, including works for stereo and multi-channel  sound, instrument and computer generated sound, and live  electroacoustic music. Her work has been recognized by artists grants  from the Seattle Arts Commission, a Bourges Residence Prize, and a Prix  Ars Electronica mention.                        Welcome!

Seminar in Memory and Cognition              PSYCH-GA.3326 May be repeated for credit. Davachi, McElree, Murphy, Phelps, Rehder. 3 points.             In-depth examination of topical issues in memory and cognition. Sample topics: mathematical models of memory and cognitive processes; aging, memory, and cognitive control; imaging methods in cognitive tasks; current controversies in categorization.                     Prejudice              PSYCH-GA.3380. Amodio. 3 points              This course provides a comprehensive overview of topics in the social psychological study of prejudice, stereotyping and intergroup relations. Each week, we will discuss both theoretical and empirical articles related to different topics within this broad field of research. Throughout the course, there will be an emphasis on considering and integrating classic and contemporary approaches to questions of intergroup relations, and discussions will focus on the ability of this research to capture the psychological phenomenon of prejudice, to make contact with other levels of analysis, and to promote social change (i.e., prejudice reduction).                     Social Neuroscience              PSYCH-GA.3381 Amodio. 3 points              This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own program of research.                     Auditory Perception &amp; Cognition              PSYCH-GA.3392 Poeppel. 3 points              A selection of issues from auditory perception and cognition are examined, from theoretical, psychophysical, and cognitive neuroscience perspectives. Topics may include pitch perception, the temporal analysis of sounds, speech perception, multi-sensory processing, MEG approaches to studying hearing and speech, and others.                     Origins of Learning              PSYCH-GA.3399. Adolph. 3 points              This course will explore the origins of learning in several ways. First, we will look for the earliest manifestations of learning in the embryo and fetus. Second, we will discuss the evidence for various learning mechanisms in infants and young children (e.g., habituation, association learning, statistical learning, rule learning, Bayesian learning, analogy, learning sets). Third, we will try to understand the role of development in learning (e.g., whether developmental changes constrain or enhance learning). Finally, we will consider how infants select among possible learning mechanisms. Readings will include classic and recent studies in the human and animal literatures. Several guest authors will join the discussion.                     Self-Regulation              PSYCH-GA.3393              The course provides an overview of major theories and findings in research and self-regulation. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of self-regulation (delay of gratification, resistance to temptation), the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, cognitive-neuropsychological research on self-regulation, and self-regulation from the perspective of economics. We will focus on interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches as well as on designing research that promotes different lines of thinking.                      Developmental Social Cognition              PSYCH-GA.3402.001              This seminar will examine the development of social cognition as a special topic in conceptual development. Major theoretical issues to be discussed include the contributions of domain-specific and domain-general learning mechanisms to development, the extent to which social cognition involves universal and culturally variable processes, and the relations between cognitive and social development. Topics to be covered include the development of mental-state reasoning, social inference, moral cognition, social categorization, stereotyping, and other topics of interest to participating students.                     Special Topics: System Justification Theory              PSYCH-GA.3404 Jost. 3 points              According to system justification theory, people are both consciously and unconsciously motivated to defend, bolster, and justify aspects of the societal status quo. In this seminar we will read and discuss the relevant research literature in order to critically evaluate the evidence pertaining to the theory and consider the broader implications of that evidence.                      Person Perception within Dyads              PSYCH-GA.3405 West. 3 points              This course focuses on theoretical and methodological approaches to studying dyadic and group-level person person processes. Topics covered will include person perception within a wide variety of close relationships (including romantic, friendship, and family relationships) and new acquaintance relationships (including friendships and intergroup relationships). Much of the focus will be on understanding how basic perception processes operate in dyad and group-level contexts; processes such as self perception, perceived partner perception, and metaperception. In addition, new methodological approaches to studying dyads and groups will be introduced. It is recommended although not required that students have taken at least one graduate course in statistics prior to enrolling in this course.                      Psychology and the Design of Legal Institutions              PSYCH-GA.3405 Tyler. 3 points              This joint law school-psychology seminar provides an overview of the literatures in which law and psychology interface. These include legal decision making by judges and juries; evidence; studies of legal procedures and institutions; and research on compliance and rehabilitation.                      The Relational Self              PSYCH-GA.3406 This seminar will cover research literatures on the manner in which the self develops, is defined, and is maintained in the context of interpersonal relationships. It will be a true seminar in that participants will read journal articles and chapters each week before class so we can all discuss these works in depth. Selected topics will be covered that involve relational aspects of the self, including the social-cognitive process of transference, relational schemas, attachment processes, contingencies of self-worth, self-protective processes, and relationship-protective processes, interdependent self-construal, self-standards/roles/norms, social identity, and culture.                          Seminar in Current Topics              PSYCH-GA.3391, 3392, 3393, 3394, 3395, 3396, 3397, 3398, 3399, 3400 May be repeated for credit. 3 points per term.             The department offers several seminars each term, reflecting the interest of advanced students or members of the faculty in contemporary problems in psychology theory, research, or practice.

One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which  gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually  stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished  professors drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from  NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional,  cultural, and governmental leaders. In spring 2005, the College  of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which  extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors  Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small  classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the  wider New York community. In some instances students may count the  classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this  appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives. Advanced  Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact  with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to  challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis  and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct  their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an  environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students  and faculty alike. \u2014Dean Matthew S. Santirocco Course Descriptions    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 72828) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of  the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court\u2019s  interpretation and application of the Constitution have adversely  affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of  government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation  of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \u201cImperial  Judiciary.\u201d Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted  properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the  face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them,  and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the  Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines  current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis  and the Court\u2019s participation in the debate. Topics include abortion,  euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights,  gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; college  speech codes, including \u201chate\u201d speech and symbolic speech; and racial  and ethnic profiling. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court  cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the  political spectrum. Students are expected to apply critical thinking to  the topics. Alan J. Pomerantz, Esq.,   is a practicing lawyer and partner of Orrick, Herrington &amp;  Sutcliffe, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School  of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree  from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands).

The United States and the War on Terror: Terrorism, Counterterrorism, and National Security (V28.0122; call # 75545) Instructor: Karen J. Greenberg Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. In  the aftermath of 9/11, the United States launched a \u201cwar on terror\u201d and  in so doing challenged some of the basic assumptions of American  domestic and international policy. In the name of security, the powers  of the presidency, the nature of the courts, the role of the media, and  the limits of internationalism have come under scrutiny. This seminar  explores the questions that have come to the fore in the war on terror  and seeks to place them in historical context. The course will address,  among other topics, the balance between security and liberty,  Guantanamo Bay, detention and the roles of the Office of the Vice  President, Department of Justice, Department of Defense, Department of  State, and the effectiveness of the United States as a partner in the  global war on terror. The course considers the changes that may be  required by a 21st century in which the emergence of security as a  vital concern has come to dominate questions of policy and philosophy. Karen J. Greenberg, Executive Director of the Center on Law and Security at the NYU School of Law, is the editor of the NYU Review of Law and Security . She co-edited The Enemy Combatant Papers: American Justice, the Courts, and the War on Terror; The Torture Papers: The Road to Abu Ghraib ; and is the editor of Al Qaeda Now and The Torture Debate in America .

Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  course explores the instability of the European state system in the  pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining  the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak  of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and  the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various  diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in  the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various  interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan  crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German  naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence,  the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal  responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict,  and the attempts to contain it. May be counted toward the major in History.  Stewart A. Stehlin   is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the  development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th  centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic  history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on  European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history,  especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866\u20131890, a translation of Friedrich Ratzel\u2019s Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican, German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919\u20131933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870\u20131919 . Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V28.0129; call # 75298) Instructor: Michael A. Westerman Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. There  are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between  individual-centered models of the person and interpersonal ones. The  seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these  unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a  long-standing fundamental question philosophers began wondering about  centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence\u2014what  place do our relationships with other people have in our lives?  Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic  interplay between psychological considerations and philosophical ones.  Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas  where these tensions appear, including models of child development,  approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy.  We also consider more \u201cinterpersonal\u201d versus more individual-centered  ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction  itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences.  We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers  suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of  psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout  the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions  by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which  contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person  from our philosophical tradition. Students who have taken V50.0247 may not register for this seminar. Michael A. Westerman   is Associate Professor of Psychology. He also holds a Consulting  Faculty appointment in the Department of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral  Sciences at Beth Israel Medical Center. His area of expertise is  clinical psychology. He has conducted research on several topics  concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of  mother-child interaction, family systems, and the patient-therapist  relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles  on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a  program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of  psychological defenses he has developed that is called the theory of  interpersonal defense. Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 72834) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and  thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion  today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal,  medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and  gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both\u2014indeed,  sometimes several\u2014sides of the issues involved. We will also look at  the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary  literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for  civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue. Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz   is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative  Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  She has published widely on many aspects of medieval literature and  culture. She has also been researching and writing about abortion for  several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about  abortion, entitled \u201cVoices,\u201d in New York and Washington, D.C. \u201cVarieties of Religious Experience\u201d Revisited (V28.0144; call # 72836) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. This  seminar will utilize but also update William James\u2019s pioneering  approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological  rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d  is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a  wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different  stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the  phenomenon of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism,  totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or  distort modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill  the vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal,  and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their  credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political  religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them  with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in  which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious  expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the  modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The  seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which  the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality  will need to occur.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was Transformed (V28.0147; call # 72839) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all  too familiar to us in the 20th century. It was a time of the Black  Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time  of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in  the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman  Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious  authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era,  there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms,  vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense  consequence for all of Europe . . . and for our own culture. Through  the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the  beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of  Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian  painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and  art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century  that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most  terrible of all the centuries before the 20th. May be counted toward the major in History.  Jill N. Claster   is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages.  She has served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as  Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (V28.0149; call # 72841) Instructor: Jing Wang Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao  Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional  form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a  vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded  as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a  synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the  tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan  in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores  the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love  and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and  destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the  excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if  hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate  plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable  characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all  times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. Jing Wang   is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and  the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was  Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature .  Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and  the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and  comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to  literary translations, she also publishes personal essays. Civil War at Rome (V28.0153; call # 75602) Instructor: Mich\u00e8le Lowrie Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  course examines the rich literature documenting the civil wars that  tore apart the Roman Republic in the first century BCE and the empire  in the first century CE. Contemporary and later writing of history,  epic, elegy, and lyric poetry finds civil war a defining experience for  Roman identity. The legend about Romulus and Remus puts fratricide at  the center of the city\u2019s foundation. The expanding empire found former  enemies drawn within, so that what previously was a war between city  states took on the coloring of civil contention retrospectively once  these areas were unified. Different sides elevate their leaders as  heroes in a cascading sequence: Caesar versus Pompey, Brutus and  Cassius versus Caesar, Antony and Octavian versus Brutus, Octavian  versus Antony. But what do the leaders stand for? Why does civil war  become a paradigm for thinking about the state? Is social violence the  reason Roman literature is obsessed with politics? We will examine the  differences between sedition, conspiracy, and civil war through the  writings of Cicero, Caesar, Sallust, Vergil, Horace, Propertius, Livy,  Lucan, Tacitus, and Suetonius along with selections from the Greek  historians Plutarch and Appian. All materials will be read in English  translation. May be counted toward the major in Classics.  Mich\u00e8le Lowrie,   Associate Professor of Classics, teaches classes ranging from  elementary language to advanced graduate seminars. She specializes in  the literature of Republican and Augustan Rome and has published on the  majority of authors represented in the course, including a monograph on  Horace and an edited volume on the reception of Vergil. Current  research interests are ancient conceptions of foundation and  sovereignty, the role of the exemplum   as a figure that tells consequential narratives, and national identity.  The reception of Rome in modern literature and political thought is an  abiding concern. She recently organized a conference on this topic at  the University of Konstanz in Germany. Forthcoming are another  monograph, Writing, Performance, and Authority in Augustan Rome, and an anthology of articles on Horace. Transdisciplinary Investigations across Multiple Evolutionary Scales (V28.0154; call # 75429) Instructor: Tyler Volk Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  TIMES seminar will take on the basis of pattern itself across the  scales of nature and mind, and search for common functional principles  in those patterns. The guiding context is the fact that evolution as a  form-generating process, in the general sense, occurs on multiple  scales, such as biological (theory of evolution), cultural (invention  and social selection), and cognition (learning and directed  creativity). All these scales have unique but also similar subprocesses  of replication, variation, and selection. Therefore, where the  functional advantages of certain general solutions are the same to the  challenges of existence on different scales, we should expect to find  common patterns as those solutions. Students will find this an exciting  area of inquiry, and are expected to enlarge their intellectual  horizons as they engage in self-directed research in the context of a  diverse group. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to enroll.    Tyler Volk is Associate Professor of Biology and also Director of Science in the new Environmental Studies Program. He is author of Metapatterns across Space, Time, and Mind ,  as well as of recent papers that elucidate the reasons for the  generation of common functional principles at different scales. He has  also looked at death as a functional aspect of life on multiple scales,  from bacteria to human psychology, in his book What Is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life \u2014and  so this view of transdisciplinary patterns has implications for  building bridges of understanding across scales. He is now working on a  project called \u201cthe evolution of gods.\u201d From Adam and Eve to the Trial of Jesus: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative (V28.0155; call # 75348) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m. The  Bible, as one of the foundational texts of Western civilization, is a  gallery of lively episodes that stimulate, nurture, or otherwise  challenge our sense and value of justice and injustice. Its  full-blooded characters gush forth with all their imperfections, and  their arresting lives present specimens of ethical problems that we  continue to confront in our everyday lives. In this course students  examine legal, moral, and normative existential issues embodied in the  dramas of such characters. In light of their episodes, themes that have  relevance to contemporary issues\u2014such as \u201caxis of evil,\u201d \u201ccommunal  responsibility,\u201d \u201cecological crisis,\u201d \u201cethics vs. religion,\u201d  \u201cgenocide,\u201d \u201choly war,\u201d \u201claw and ruler,\u201d \u201cthe Other,\u201d \u201creligious  intolerance,\u201d \u201csanctity of human life,\u201d and \u201csexual temptation and  moral obligation\u201d\u2014will be thoroughly scrutinized. Readings will cover  some key texts on the notion(s) of justice, readings from the Bible and  selected bibliographies for each of the biblical episodes. Students  will acquire tools to differentiate and hone their understanding of the  meaning of \u201cjustice\u201d and be challenged to reconsider, both critically  and creatively, their assumptions and apprehension of moral  responsibility, and ultimately, their own worldview and  self-understanding through a rereading of passages from the Bible. The  seminar will be taught at the Law School by law school methods  (\u201cSocratic\u201d interactive) and standards\u2014rigorous but academically and  intellectually rewarding.

Reconstructing World Violence: A Hobbesian Approach (V28.0156; call # 75320) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday: 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Humans  are as violent as any creature, but we have something in abundance that  others may lack: the ability to sustain and glorify our violence by  justifying it. After attempting to develop coherent accounts of this  phenomenon, students in this seminar consider ways in which pacifist  systems of thought have interacted with violent systems of  justification, often but not always with genocidal results. It was in  the midst of such a violent crisis that Hobbes initiated what remains  an undeveloped approach. If one can extrapolate from Hobbes\u2019s  nationalist agenda and redirect his approach in a democratic way, one  can arrive (as many have) at the following claim: only when globally  sovereign conflict-resolving institutions are fully authorized will any  subordinate system justifying violence lose its force and coherence,  except in the case of violent revolutionary movements which challenge  the global authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling  attempts to operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of  this claim not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its  implications or suspect its grounding. William Klein   teaches social foundations in NYU\u2019s Liberal Studies Program. In the  College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse  Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to  NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught  the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics,  from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under  a pen name) modern crime. Don Quixote (V28.0157; call # 75428) Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. This seminar explores the privileged position of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote   as first modern novel while also attending to the historical and  literary contexts from which it emerged. On one hand, our close reading  of Don Quixote considers how it is a work of recycling and crisis that  incorporates, parodies, and transforms all previous literary \u2014and many  non-literary\u2014 discourses to invent a new narrative form that does not  subscribe to any single poetics. On the other hand, this seminar  attempts to contextualize Cervantes\u2019s work within its historical  moment. To this end we consider some of the most important social,  political, economic, religious and cultural debates and institutions of  Renaissance Europe including Inquisition, imperial expansion, and  political and economic decline. We also explore questions of madness,  erotic and literary desire, authorship, subjectivity, the seductions  and the dangers of reading, the status of representation, translation,  literal vision versus literary visions, the workings of gender, race,  class and nation, and the tenuous frontiers between fiction and  history. The seminar is conducted in  English. Students may read the text in English (using Edith Grossman\u2019s  acclaimed translation) or in the original Spanish. May be counted  toward the major in Spanish or in Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  Georgina Dopico Black is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and Editor of the Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies. She is the author of Perfect Wives, Other Women: Adultery and Inquisition in Early Modern Spain (2001), winner of the MLA\u2019s Katherine Singer Kovacs Prize and of Yale\u2019s Heyman Award. She has co-edited Suplemento al Tesoro de la lengua espa\u00f1ola de Sebasti\u00e1n de Covarrubias (2001), as well as two books on Cervantes: En un lugar de la Mancha (1999) and USA Cervantes (2008). Her current projects include one book on Don Quixote, another  on bodies and methods of truth production in the early modern period,  and a cultural history of medieval and Renaissance Spain. She has also  published articles on the morisco expulsion, the first Spanish  dictionary, Renaissance libraries, Inquisitorial torture, prostitution,  relics, and questions of national definition. The New York Dance Scene: Performance and Criticism Today (V28.0158; call # 75427) Instructor: Jennifer Homans Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  course offers a tour of today\u2019s dance scene in New York. We attend and  discuss performances ranging from classical ballet to \u201ccutting edge\u201d  contemporary dance. But seeing is only the beginning. Students also  study the historical roots of each performance we attend and read about  the artists involved (dancers and choreographers but also musicians and  designers). We evaluate each performance critically and historically,  and situate it within the larger cultural debates of our time. We study  classical ballet in its traditional and contemporary forms through  performances by New York City Ballet and Armitage Gone! Our examination  of the current state of American modern dance takes us to performances  at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Dance Theater Workshop, and the  Baryshnikov Arts Center, among others. Students attend performances  every other week; the interim week is devoted to discussion and  analysis. In preparation for class, students read historical  background, biographies, and criticism, and each student prepares an  in-class presentation relating to the performances we attend. In  consultation with the instructor, students also select a topic or  artist for a final extended essay. Jennifer Homans is the dance critic for the New Republic   and a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at New York University. She  holds a Ph.D. in Modern European History, and her forthcoming book, Classical Ballet: A New History ,  is a cultural history that follows ballet from its origins in  17th-century France to the present. Her articles have also appeared in  the New York Times and the New York Review of Books.   In her previous career, she was a professional dancer, trained in  ballet, modern, and jazz techniques. She performed with the Chicago  Lyric Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet  and has danced a wide repertory, ranging from the ballet classics to  works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and other contemporary  choreographers. The Pastness of the Present: Exploring \u201cHistorically Informed Performance\u201d and \u201cHistorically Involved Composition\u201d (V28.0159; call # 75642) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. How  have performers of notated Western musics resolved the interpretive  dilemmas that result from performing musics which arose amidst distant  historical conditions and traditions? Tracing 19th- and 20th-century  answers to this question, students will explore the historically  informed performance movement in music studies. Concurrently, we will  consider what this movement\u2019s hypotheses and ethics might reveal if  used as a framework for viewing composers\u2019 confrontations with past  style practices. The ultimate goal of the course is to give students a  new set of questions with which to interrogate musical culture in the  21st century, and an intellectual framework with which to formulate  their own responses and experience. Case studies will be drawn from the  baroque period and the 19th and 20th centuries, and will include  selected examples of recent popular musics. The course should be of  interest to students majoring in music, history, philosophy, and other  disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. There are no prerequisites for this course. Ability to read music is strongly suggested, but is not required. Elizabeth Hoffman,   Associate Professor of Music, is the recipient of a Golden Dozen  Teaching Award. Her research interests include theories of tuning;  timbrally and texturally driven media forms; rhythmic complexity;  theories of notation and interpretation; aesthetics; the impact of  technology on creative thought; and the involvement of women in the  field of music composition. In addition to acoustic music, she composes  electroacoustic music, including works for stereo and multi-channel  sound, instrument and computer generated sound, and live  electroacoustic music. Her work has been recognized by artists grants  from the Seattle Arts Commission, a Bourges Residence Prize, and a Prix  Ars Electronica mention.                        Welcome!
