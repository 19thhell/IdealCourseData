Small enough for students to get to know well in six weeks, but large enough to provide an authentic, vibrant, big city experience, Dublin is an ideal place to study abroad. The city\u2019s combination of intimacy and cosmopolitanism is reflected in the ethos of our program, which fosters a friendly and close-knit atmosphere, but also looks beyond the boundaries of the city to give students a taste of everything that Ireland has to offer\u2013from traditional music festivals to the stunning islands of Ireland\u2019s west coast.   Our home base is Trinity College, Ireland\u2019s most prestigious university, located right in the heart of Dublin. Trinity\u2019s famous front gate and stone walls enclose a beautiful, safe, ivy-covered campus, where our students live in individual rooms in dormitory accommodations, which one former student described as \u201cabsolutely amazing.\u201d The immersive experience that the program provides is a key part of NYU in Dublin: rather than experiencing the city as tourists, our students live in the heart of Dublin, getting to know the city and its people as locals. As one of our students put it, \u201cDublin became a second home to me.\u201d        ACADEMICS      Cultural immersion is also central to our academic program: all of our professors are from Ireland, and all of our courses use the city as a classroom, incorporating field trips and organizing class visits by local historians, award-winning writers, and musicians. Students rave about how our \u201cphenomenal professors\u201d make Dublin an integral part of the academic experience, holding class sessions at places like the National Gallery of Ireland; the quirky, perfectly-preserved Marsh\u2019s library, which dates back to the early 18th century; and even the back room at Mulligans\u2019, where James Joyce used to go to observe the locals and take notes for his fiction. The program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students from NYU or from other universities. Program participants pursue an intensive study of Irish society and culture through courses in sociology, history, literature, Irish language and culture, and creative writing. All classes are held at Trinity College, where you will be in good company, walking in the footsteps of Samuel Beckett, Oscar Wilde, and Jonathan Swift, to name just a few famous Trinity alumni.

HOUSING &amp; MEALS   All undergraduate students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. We\u2019ll be living in the heart of Trinity\u2019s picturesque campus, in the ivy-covered square known as \u201cBotany Bay\u2019 (a former 19th-century garden). Every student has his or her own room, and shares a kitchen, living room and bathroom with one other person. The campus is very secure- it's entirely walled off from the city, making it a peaceful oasis in the midst of the bustle of Dublin. Students have wireless Internet in most locations on campus, and 24-hour access to a designated computer lab, as well as summer hour access to the college library. Also, the National Library of Ireland is adjacent to the college campus, and students receive a comprehensive introduction to the library and its research facilities. Bed linens and towels are provided, and laundry facilities and a gym are also available.        EXCURSIONS      Click here for a campus map . House 13 at Botany Bay will be your home this summer.     A diverse array of cultural activities forms an integral part of the program. In addition to experiencing Dublin, students travel together to various parts of Ireland, north and south. Destinations vary from year to year but all excursions are designed to enhance and deepen the understanding of Irish culture that students receive in the classroom. Planned destinations for Summer 2015 include:       Two days on the beautiful island of Inishbofin, off the Galway coast, guided by one of Ireland's most eminent archaeologists, Michael Gibbons.   Two nights in Doolin, Co. Clare.   A visit to the Willie Clancy traditional music festival in Milltown Malbay, Co. Clare.   A visit to the Connemara Pony Show in the picturesque village of Roundstone.   Two days in the Gaelic-speaking culture of Gweedore in Co. Donegal.   A visit to the rugged and remote Tory Island in the company of the island's &quot;King.&quot; Patsy Dan Rogers.   A tour of the fascinating murals of Belfast.   A tour of Norther Ireland's historic walled city of Derry.     A behind-the-scenes tour of the Dail, Ireland's parliament.   A visit to the majestic prehistoric monuments of the Boyne Valley.   A trip to the stadium at Croke Park to see our national sport, hurling.   Visits to the National Library (where you will be given an introduction into how to go about doing research work in its vast archives), the National Museum, the wonderful Marsh's Library, the Chester Beatty Museum, the Irish Writers' Centre and more.   A tour of Kilmainham Gaol, one of the most important historical sites in Ireland.     A play at the historic Abbey Theatre.               COURSES     Undergraduate Courses     Undergraduate students must register for 8 points. All courses are open to undergraduates. A limited number of courses are open to graduate students. Graduate students may register for 4 or 8 points.                                                    IRISH-UA 9100 - Elementary Irish I - \u00d3 Cear\u00faill - 4 points                               Open to undergraduates only.  The aim of this course is for students to achieve fundamental proficiency in Gaelic, as it is spoken in the Donegal Gaeltacht. Beginning with basic vocabulary and grammar, students master conversational phrases and traditional songs by the end of this course. Students have many opportunities to practice language skills throughout the program.   Sample syllabus.                                                                IRISH-UA 9104 -\u00a0Irish Culture: Tradition and Modernity - \u00d3 Cear\u00faill - 4 points                               This course analyzes the traditional cultural patterns embedded in folklore, popular culture, language, religious, cultural and sporting institutions. The objective is to discover how such structures transformed from their past existence and to examine the changing patterns and values of contemporary life in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Of particular interest in this course is the place of tradition in a society that is rapidly changing, becoming more modern, European, secular, and urban.   Sample syllabus.                                                                  IRISH-UA 9184 -\u00a0History of Modern Ireland\u00a0- Hanley - 4 points                               The course begins with an examination of the era of revolution and war that gave rise to a divided Ireland and moves on to study the following decades of state-building, the impact of the Second World War, cultural identity, religion, emigration, modernization, the reemergence of the &quot;troubles&quot; and the subsequent &quot;war&quot; in Northern Ireland, and the recent moves toward peace. Lectures from guest speakers and politicians and field trips to sites of historical interest form an integral part of the course.   Sample syllabus.                                                                  IRISH-UA 9515 -\u00a0Contemporary Irish Politics and Society: The Sociology of Change - Slater - 4 Points                               Enormous changes have occurred in Ireland in the last decade, especially the social and cultural implications of the economic boom known as the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; that have transformed the country in so many ways. What happens to the social life of a nation that leapfrogs from being an agricultural economy to a technologically-advanced postindustrial one? The changes that Ireland has undergone extend to all areas of public and private life: the (uneven) rise in levels of personal wealth; the decline of the Catholic church, both as a means of social organization and as a mode of private, personal understanding of the world; the change from being a population defined by emigration to one now experiencing much higher levels of immigration; and the attendant challenges of our transformation into a more dramatically multicultural society. How did the transformation happen? Ireland managed to attract a huge amount of foreign direct investment but to what extent is Ireland dependent on other nations, especially the U.S., for its current prosperity? How did affluence (and the recent precipitous drop in the nation\u2019s economic prosperity) change the way that Irish people live? Ireland is often seen as a post-colonial society; if true, what influence does this condition have on Irish ability to participate in the 21st-century global economy? Sample syllabus.                                                              IRISH-UA 9762 - Topics in Irish Literature: Contemporary Irish Literature - Creaney - 4 points                               This course explores the works of the most important figures in the last fifty years of Irish literature and drama. We will begin with the midcentury works of Samuel Beckett and Flann O'Brien, two writers who were in many ways ahead of their time, and then consider more contemporary representations of Irish identity in the works of Brian Friel, Marina Carr, Conor McPherson, Seamus Heaney, Paul Muldoon, Derek Mahon, Medbh McGuckian, Ciaran Carson, Anne Enright, Colm Toibin, Paul Murray and others. The class will take a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach, and will explore how these authors connect to contemporary Irish culture in its other forms, including music, visual art, and film. We will have class visits from several of the writers on the syllabus, and some of our class meetings will take place outside the confines of the classroom, in some of the historic haunts frequented by the writers we are reading. Sample syllabus.                                                              CRWRI-UA 9815 - Creative Writing: Intro Fiction and Poetry - Kilroy - 4 points                               This popular introductory workshop offers an exciting introduction to the basic elements of fiction and poetry, with in-class writing, take-home reading and writing assignments, and substantive discussions of craft. The course is structured as a workshop, which means that students receive feedback from their instructor and their fellow writers in a roundtable setting, and they should be prepared to offer their classmates responses to their work.                    Graduate Courses   There are a limited number of courses open to graduate students. Graduate students may register for 4 or 8 points.     The following courses offered at the undergraduate level are also offered to graduate students, who attend the same classes and lectures as the undergraduate students. However, in terms of academic requirements, graduate students are expected to write a research paper for each of their courses, to meet with the professor one additional hour per week, and to take full advantage of their professor's area of expertise in terms of advice, supervision, and use of research resources in Dublin.

STUDENT TESTIMONIALS     I can say without a doubt that coming on this trip was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I feel as though I've been able to engage with Irish culture on a new, deeper level after living here for six weeks.   The interaction between the students and the faculty allowed learning to extend outside the  classroom.   It was incredible--a perfect balance of academic and cultural experiences. And fun!   The program activities and trips were completely unparalleled. I cannot express how valuable they were to my experience on this trip.   Housing was better than my NYU living arrangements. Trinity College is a beautiful campus, the dorm rooms are huge and there is weekly maid service. We got a full kitchen and dining room, and we lived right in the center of Dublin.   The program activities and trips were completely unparalleled. I cannot express how valuable they were to my experience on this trip.

Small enough for students to get to know well in six weeks, but large enough to provide an authentic, vibrant, big city experience, Dublin is an ideal place to study abroad. The city\u2019s combination of intimacy and cosmopolitanism is reflected in the ethos of our program, which fosters a friendly and close-knit atmosphere, but also looks beyond the boundaries of the city to give students a taste of everything that Ireland has to offer\u2013from traditional music festivals to the stunning islands of Ireland\u2019s west coast.   Our home base is Trinity College, Ireland\u2019s most prestigious university, located right in the heart of Dublin. Trinity\u2019s famous front gate and stone walls enclose a beautiful, safe, ivy-covered campus, where our students live in individual rooms in dormitory accommodations, which one former student described as \u201cabsolutely amazing.\u201d The immersive experience that the program provides is a key part of NYU in Dublin: rather than experiencing the city as tourists, our students live in the heart of Dublin, getting to know the city and its people as locals. As one of our students put it, \u201cDublin became a second home to me.\u201d        ACADEMICS      Cultural immersion is also central to our academic program: all of our professors are from Ireland, and all of our courses use the city as a classroom, incorporating field trips and organizing class visits by local historians, award-winning writers, and musicians. Students rave about how our \u201cphenomenal professors\u201d make Dublin an integral part of the academic experience, holding class sessions at places like the National Gallery of Ireland; the quirky, perfectly-preserved Marsh\u2019s library, which dates back to the early 18th century; and even the back room at Mulligans\u2019, where James Joyce used to go to observe the locals and take notes for his fiction. The program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students from NYU or from other universities. Program participants pursue an intensive study of Irish society and culture through courses in sociology, history, literature, Irish language and culture, and creative writing. All classes are held at Trinity College, where you will be in good company, walking in the footsteps of Samuel Beckett, Oscar Wilde, and Jonathan Swift, to name just a few famous Trinity alumni.

HOUSING &amp; MEALS   All undergraduate students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. We\u2019ll be living in the heart of Trinity\u2019s picturesque campus, in the ivy-covered square known as \u201cBotany Bay\u2019 (a former 19th-century garden). Every student has his or her own room, and shares a kitchen, living room and bathroom with one other person. The campus is very secure- it's entirely walled off from the city, making it a peaceful oasis in the midst of the bustle of Dublin. Students have wireless Internet in most locations on campus, and 24-hour access to a designated computer lab, as well as summer hour access to the college library. Also, the National Library of Ireland is adjacent to the college campus, and students receive a comprehensive introduction to the library and its research facilities. Bed linens and towels are provided, and laundry facilities and a gym are also available.        EXCURSIONS      Click here for a campus map . House 13 at Botany Bay will be your home this summer.     A diverse array of cultural activities forms an integral part of the program. In addition to experiencing Dublin, students travel together to various parts of Ireland, north and south. Destinations vary from year to year but all excursions are designed to enhance and deepen the understanding of Irish culture that students receive in the classroom. Planned destinations for Summer 2015 include:       Two days on the beautiful island of Inishbofin, off the Galway coast, guided by one of Ireland's most eminent archaeologists, Michael Gibbons.   Two nights in Doolin, Co. Clare.   A visit to the Willie Clancy traditional music festival in Milltown Malbay, Co. Clare.   A visit to the Connemara Pony Show in the picturesque village of Roundstone.   Two days in the Gaelic-speaking culture of Gweedore in Co. Donegal.   A visit to the rugged and remote Tory Island in the company of the island's &quot;King.&quot; Patsy Dan Rogers.   A tour of the fascinating murals of Belfast.   A tour of Norther Ireland's historic walled city of Derry.     A behind-the-scenes tour of the Dail, Ireland's parliament.   A visit to the majestic prehistoric monuments of the Boyne Valley.   A trip to the stadium at Croke Park to see our national sport, hurling.   Visits to the National Library (where you will be given an introduction into how to go about doing research work in its vast archives), the National Museum, the wonderful Marsh's Library, the Chester Beatty Museum, the Irish Writers' Centre and more.   A tour of Kilmainham Gaol, one of the most important historical sites in Ireland.     A play at the historic Abbey Theatre.               COURSES     Undergraduate Courses     Undergraduate students must register for 8 points. All courses are open to undergraduates. A limited number of courses are open to graduate students. Graduate students may register for 4 or 8 points.                                                    IRISH-UA 9100 - Elementary Irish I - \u00d3 Cear\u00faill - 4 points                               Open to undergraduates only.  The aim of this course is for students to achieve fundamental proficiency in Gaelic, as it is spoken in the Donegal Gaeltacht. Beginning with basic vocabulary and grammar, students master conversational phrases and traditional songs by the end of this course. Students have many opportunities to practice language skills throughout the program.   Sample syllabus.                                                                IRISH-UA 9104 -\u00a0Irish Culture: Tradition and Modernity - \u00d3 Cear\u00faill - 4 points                               This course analyzes the traditional cultural patterns embedded in folklore, popular culture, language, religious, cultural and sporting institutions. The objective is to discover how such structures transformed from their past existence and to examine the changing patterns and values of contemporary life in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Of particular interest in this course is the place of tradition in a society that is rapidly changing, becoming more modern, European, secular, and urban.

IRISH-UA 9184 -\u00a0History of Modern Ireland\u00a0- Hanley - 4 points                               The course begins with an examination of the era of revolution and war that gave rise to a divided Ireland and moves on to study the following decades of state-building, the impact of the Second World War, cultural identity, religion, emigration, modernization, the reemergence of the &quot;troubles&quot; and the subsequent &quot;war&quot; in Northern Ireland, and the recent moves toward peace. Lectures from guest speakers and politicians and field trips to sites of historical interest form an integral part of the course.   Sample syllabus.                                                                  IRISH-UA 9515 -\u00a0Contemporary Irish Politics and Society: The Sociology of Change - Slater - 4 Points                               Enormous changes have occurred in Ireland in the last decade, especially the social and cultural implications of the economic boom known as the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; that have transformed the country in so many ways. What happens to the social life of a nation that leapfrogs from being an agricultural economy to a technologically-advanced postindustrial one? The changes that Ireland has undergone extend to all areas of public and private life: the (uneven) rise in levels of personal wealth; the decline of the Catholic church, both as a means of social organization and as a mode of private, personal understanding of the world; the change from being a population defined by emigration to one now experiencing much higher levels of immigration; and the attendant challenges of our transformation into a more dramatically multicultural society. How did the transformation happen? Ireland managed to attract a huge amount of foreign direct investment but to what extent is Ireland dependent on other nations, especially the U.S., for its current prosperity? How did affluence (and the recent precipitous drop in the nation\u2019s economic prosperity) change the way that Irish people live? Ireland is often seen as a post-colonial society; if true, what influence does this condition have on Irish ability to participate in the 21st-century global economy?

IRISH-UA 9762 - Topics in Irish Literature: Contemporary Irish Literature - Creaney - 4 points                               This course explores the works of the most important figures in the last fifty years of Irish literature and drama. We will begin with the midcentury works of Samuel Beckett and Flann O'Brien, two writers who were in many ways ahead of their time, and then consider more contemporary representations of Irish identity in the works of Brian Friel, Marina Carr, Conor McPherson, Seamus Heaney, Paul Muldoon, Derek Mahon, Medbh McGuckian, Ciaran Carson, Anne Enright, Colm Toibin, Paul Murray and others. The class will take a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach, and will explore how these authors connect to contemporary Irish culture in its other forms, including music, visual art, and film. We will have class visits from several of the writers on the syllabus, and some of our class meetings will take place outside the confines of the classroom, in some of the historic haunts frequented by the writers we are reading.

CRWRI-UA 9815 - Creative Writing: Intro Fiction and Poetry - Kilroy - 4 points                               This popular introductory workshop offers an exciting introduction to the basic elements of fiction and poetry, with in-class writing, take-home reading and writing assignments, and substantive discussions of craft.

STUDENT TESTIMONIALS     I can say without a doubt that coming on this trip was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I feel as though I've been able to engage with Irish culture on a new, deeper level after living here for six weeks.   The interaction between the students and the faculty allowed learning to extend outside the  classroom.   It was incredible--a perfect balance of academic and cultural experiences. And fun!   The program activities and trips were completely unparalleled. I cannot express how valuable they were to my experience on this trip.   Housing was better than my NYU living arrangements. Trinity College is a beautiful campus, the dorm rooms are huge and there is weekly maid service. We got a full kitchen and dining room, and we lived right in the center of Dublin.   The program activities and trips were completely unparalleled. I cannot express how valuable they were to my experience on this trip.
