Resources when students have academic issues:   \u2022 Please contact:   Amy Spellacy , Assistant Dean of Advising   amy.spellacy@nyu.edu   (212) 992-9837  (212) 992-9837    Resources when students have wellness issues:   \u2022 Gallatin\u2019s Office of Student Affairs assists students with a broad spectrum of wellness issues, as well as with leaves of absence, academic performance, school/life balance, housing issues, semester withdrawals, stress management, adjusting to college issues and personal conflicts. Professional staff members are available to listen and to provide limited counseling to help students identify what may be troubling them and to develop strategies to cope. Student Affairs also connects students with NYU\u2019s Counseling and Wellness Services for more extensive individual counseling, and to provide information on low-cost referrals.   Nicholas Lanzier i, Associate Director, Student Affairs   nicholas.lanzieri@nyu.edu   (212) 998-7375  (212) 998-7375    Rahul Hamid , Director, Student Affairs   rahul.hamid@nyu.edu   (212) 992-7750  (212) 992-7750    \u2022 The Wellness Exchange is NYU's extensive network of health and mental health resources. If a student is in distress and needs immediate assistance, he or she should contact the Wellness Exchange Hotline, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Additionally, students can email the Wellness Exchange or visit a counselor during walk-in hours (no appointment necessary).   Wellness Exchange  726 Broadway, 4th floor   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu  Hotline: (212) 443-9999  (212) 443-9999  (available 24/7)   If you have questions at any time, or wish to consult about a student, do not hesitate to contact the Wellness Exchange at (212) 443-9999  (212) 443-9999  . If an immediate assessment of a student is necessary, please know that by calling the hotline, a counselor can be dispatched to your classroom to assist you. In addition, the Student Health Center has an excellent on-line resource\u2014 available at www.nyu.edu/999/handbook\u2014to assist faculty members in dealing with an NYU student who may be having mental health issues or is in crisis. You can also access this website by logging into NYUHome, and clicking on the &quot;NYU Life&quot; tab.   \u2022 The Office of Equal Opportunity is available to students, faculty and staff with respect to any questions and concerns about sexual harassment, sexual violence, or other forms of discrimination on the basis of sex. New York University is committed to complying with Title IX and enforcing University policies prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex.   Mary Signor , Executive Director   mary.signor@nyu.edu   (212) 998-2352  (212) 998-2352    Student victims and complainants in situations involving sexual assault are afforded certain rights specified in the Policy on Sexual Assault, Harassment and Other forms of Sexual Misconduct. Where immediate assistance is required, emergency help is available. In addition to using the complaint procedures under University policies, a victim of sexual misconduct has the option to report the incident to the appropriate local authorities and the University will assist victims in doing so.   The NYU Wellness Exchange also provides support and resources for sexual assault prevention and response.   What you can do as faculty:    \u2022 Be alert to signs that a student may be in distress or danger. These indicators include a decline in quality or timeliness of work; repeated unexplained absences or lateness; writings or comments that express despair, rage, or isolation; deterioration in physical appearance or personal hygiene; extreme negative moods, or signs of substance abuse such as alcohol odor or bloodshot eyes. Inform Gallatin\u2019s Office of Student Affairs. Student Affairs will email or phone the student. The objective is to assess the presenting issue(s) and then recommend next steps.   Nicholas Lanzieri , Associate Director, Student Affairs   nicholas.lanzieri@nyu.edu   (212) 998-7375  (212) 998-7375    Rahul Hamid , Director, Student Affairs   rahul.hamid@nyu.edu   (212) 992-7750  (212) 992-7750    \u2022 You can talk to the student privately if you notice signs of distress. Express your concern, point out specifically the signs you've observed, and ask what's wrong. Be patient, supportive, and wary of quick dismissals (&quot;It's nothing, I'm fine.&quot;). You do not have to take on the role of counselor. Usually, listening carefully should make clear whether a problem interferes with a student's well-being and/or school performance.   \u2022 Suggest to a student that he or she make use of Gallatin\u2019s Office of Student Affairs or NYU\u2019s Wellness Exchange services on his/her own. It may help to point out that the Office of Student Affairs can facilitate the initial contact with the Wellness Exchange. You may also want to inform the student that Wellness Exchange services are confidential, free of charge, and do not require that students have health insurance.     If you have questions at any time, or wish to consult about a student, do not hesitate to contact the Wellness Exchange at (212) 443-9999  (212) 443-9999  .
