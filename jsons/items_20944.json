The University extends ongoing opportunities and NYUiLearn for current and new employees to receive inspiration and value from their professional development. To be most effective, follow the 70-20-10 formula when planning how to develop new work-related skills and abilities:                               70% \u2013 On-the-Job Experiences   Seek out and take on more challenging assignments and work. This may involve volunteering for a project in your department or a University-wide committee. Or it may mean looking for opportunities within your current role to improve processes and achieve efficiencies.                               20% \u2013 Coaching and Feedback   Each year, your supervisor considers and provides you with feedback through a formal performance communication process . But receiving feedback on your work shouldn't be a once-a-year event but an ongoing opportunity. As you progress on the many challenging assignments the University has to offer, seek informal feedback from your colleagues and your manager on what you're doing well and where you may improve. With this insight you may then decide how best to focus your professional development efforts \u2013 where you have a strength to foster and use as often as possible and where you may have a development need to address.                               10% \u2013 Formal Training   Throughout the year, the Office of Talent, Learning, and Organizational Development designs and offers workshops to enhance the skills of support staff, administrators, and managers. Some of these programs are provided on an open-enrollment basis to all employees across the University, and some are offered online. A critical component of your professional development, NYUiLearn features an online repository of job-specific courses your supervisor may have assigned and other professional development seminars and events you may wish to register for. The Office of Talent, Learning, and Organizational Development also reviews requests for customized services and training , collaborating with individual departments and units to help them identify and address locally-specific needs.

The University extends ongoing opportunities and NYUiLearn for current and new employees to receive inspiration and value from their professional development. To be most effective, follow the 70-20-10 formula when planning how to develop new work-related skills and abilities:                               70% \u2013 On-the-Job Experiences   Seek out and take on more challenging assignments and work. This may involve volunteering for a project in your department or a University-wide committee. Or it may mean looking for opportunities within your current role to improve processes and achieve efficiencies.                               20% \u2013 Coaching and Feedback   Each year, your supervisor considers and provides you with feedback through a formal performance communication process . But receiving feedback on your work shouldn't be a once-a-year event but an ongoing opportunity. As you progress on the many challenging assignments the University has to offer, seek informal feedback from your colleagues and your manager on what you're doing well and where you may improve. With this insight you may then decide how best to focus your professional development efforts \u2013 where you have a strength to foster and use as often as possible and where you may have a development need to address.                               10% \u2013 Formal Training   Throughout the year, the Office of Talent, Learning, and Organizational Development designs and offers workshops to enhance the skills of support staff, administrators, and managers. Some of these programs are provided on an open-enrollment basis to all employees across the University, and some are offered online. A critical component of your professional development, NYUiLearn features an online repository of job-specific courses your supervisor may have assigned and other professional development seminars and events you may wish to register for. The Office of Talent, Learning, and Organizational Development also reviews requests for customized services and training , collaborating with individual departments and units to help them identify and address locally-specific needs.
