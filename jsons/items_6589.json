Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

There are no prerequisites unless otherwise specified. Introduction to Sociological Analysis    Introduction to Sociology   SOC-UA 1 Offered every semester. Arum, Conley, Molotch. 4 points.   Survey of the field of sociology: its basic concepts, theories, and research orientation. Threshold course that provides the student with insights into the social factors in human life. Topics include social interaction, socialization, culture, social structure, stratification, political power, deviance, social institutions, and social change.    Introduction to Sociology   SOC-UA 2 Honors course. Offered every two years. Lehman. 4 points.   How sociologists view the world compared to common-sense understandings. Exposes students to the intellectual strategies at the center of modern sociology, but also shows that sociological analysis does not occur in a historical vacuum. Sociology attempts to explain events, but it is also a historical product like other human belief systems. Addresses the human condition: where we came from, where we are, where we are headed, and why. Same topics as SOC-UA 1, but more intensive. Recommended for students who would like to be challenged.    Great Books in Sociology   SOC-UA 3 Offered every three years. Chibber, Corradi, Goodwin. 4 points.

And, conversely, how do the stories we tell ourselves about our lives shape us?

This course will explore how memories are \"written\" in order to help students sharpen their own writing.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

There are no prerequisites unless otherwise specified. Introduction to Sociological Analysis    Introduction to Sociology   SOC-UA 1 Offered every semester. Arum, Conley, Molotch. 4 points.   Survey of the field of sociology: its basic concepts, theories, and research orientation. Threshold course that provides the student with insights into the social factors in human life. Topics include social interaction, socialization, culture, social structure, stratification, political power, deviance, social institutions, and social change.    Introduction to Sociology   SOC-UA 2 Honors course. Offered every two years. Lehman. 4 points.   How sociologists view the world compared to common-sense understandings. Exposes students to the intellectual strategies at the center of modern sociology, but also shows that sociological analysis does not occur in a historical vacuum. Sociology attempts to explain events, but it is also a historical product like other human belief systems. Addresses the human condition: where we came from, where we are, where we are headed, and why. Same topics as SOC-UA 1, but more intensive. Recommended for students who would like to be challenged.    Great Books in Sociology   SOC-UA 3 Offered every three years. Chibber, Corradi, Goodwin. 4 points.

And, conversely, how do the stories we tell ourselves about our lives shape us? At the interface of what lies on the printed page and what lies within individual memory lies a process of interpretation and manipulation&mdash;the process of writing. This course will explore how memories are \"written\" in order to help students sharpen their own writing. The process of writing a series of critical papers over the course of the semester will serve as background for the final research paper.
