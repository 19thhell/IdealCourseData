A. The Dance Education Program offers four curricular tracks of study culminating at the M.A. level. The first three tracks share an identical sequence of core courses: Methods &amp; Materials, Improvisation, Composition/Teaching Performance, Technique &amp; Pedagogy, Laban Movement Analysis, Research in Dance Education and Seminar in Dance Education. These core courses are augmented by additional requirements specific to each track as well as selected elective courses.       Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 + Teacher Certification (40 points): For students who wish to attain additional credentials that allow them to teach dance in public schools. These students will complete all requirements for NY State Certification in Dance Pre-K&ndash;12. Reciprocity with other states is available. International students now have the option to be credentialed. Sometimes, students who do not wish to teach in schools full-time, but who wish to develop artist-in-resident programs or after-school programs choose to complete this credential. This is a highly rigorous track with many out-of-program course requirements. Graduates of this track are highly sought after for admission into doctoral programs and for teaching in higher education. Students who do envision moving from a Pre-K&ndash;12 career to a higher education career are encouraged to complete two additional courses in lieu of electives.    Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 (34 points): For the in-service educator who has more than one full-time year of teaching dance on a Initial Dance Certification in Pre-K&ndash;12 schools. Students on this track seek to attain the State required M.A. degree to maintain certification and to enrich and expand their dance and pedagogy skills. Students on this track are interested in advancing their career to attain Staff Development, or Administrative positions in Pre-K&ndash;12 school systems. Many students on this track are concerned with preparing for career transition to doctoral degrees and higher education positions and elect courses with this interest in mind. Students who have certification and one year of full-time teaching in an area other than dance are eligible for Dual Certification (36-40 points).     Teaching Dance in the Professions (36 points): For those who wish to prepare for doctoral study, teach in higher education, or develop and administer dance education programs for cultural institutions or schools of dance. This track is particularly attractive to artists who have been working professionals (performers, choreographers) who find M.F.A. programs redundant to their professional artistry experience. The Professions track students are seeking to build alternative skills in teaching and scholarship and to gain a competitive edge through research in the higher education field. Students graduating from this track are immediately employable for full-time positions at community colleges and for adjunct positions at institutions of higher education. This track is also attractive to students who aim their career toward the \"professions\" by directing education programs at cultural institutions, developing private schools of dance or developing community programs that interface with boards of education.    Teaching Dance: ABT Ballet Pedagogy (36 - 39 points). This newly designed concentration is for students intending to teach in private studios, conservatories, as teaching-artists and community outreach (36 credits). The dance teaching aspect of this curriculum is taught by American Ballet Theatre master teachers who emphasize the development of the ballet dancer. Pedagogy and research are complemented with several arts management courses, preparing the graduate for employment in the private sector. The culminating project of this track is the preparation of a business plan for a private studio. The applicant for this track is an accomplished ballet dancer who wants to develop pedagogical content in this art form. In addition to the MA degree in teaching dance in the professions, the graduate receives an ABT Ballet Pedagogy certificate.       Q: What is the difference between an M.A. and a M.F.A. degree?    A. The Dance Education Program offers a M.A. degree in Dance Education. M.A. degrees are scholarly-oriented degrees that prepare scholars for doctoral study and research inquiry. Scholarly degrees are terminated at the Ph.D. or Ed.D. level.    M.F.A.s are artistry-oriented degrees that aim toward preparing performers or choreographers for the professional field. Artistry-oriented study begins at the B.F.A. level and terminate at the M.F.A. level.    Q: How long do the tracks take?    A. Students have the freedom to determine which semesters they will enroll full-time (12 or more points) or as part-time (9 or less points).       Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 with Teacher Certification (40 points) = 2 years, full-time    Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 (34 point) in-service = 1 1/2 years, full-time    Teaching Dance in the Professions = 1 1/2 years, full-time    Teaching Dance in the Professions with ABT Ballet Pedagogy Concentration = 1 1/2 years, full-time       Q: Can I individualize a curriculum?    A. If you are applying to the M.A. in Teaching Dance in the Professions track, your prior experience will determine how individualized your track can become.    If you are applying to either of the two M. A. in Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 tracks, these are State Department of Education regulated curriculums that require particular that particular course content be achieved. Both of these tracks do include selected electives which can be individualized to students interests and needs.    All tracks allow for students to take courses out of program. Students can elect from a wide array of courses within the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions and within the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, as well as Gallatin courses and Tisch Performance Studies.    Q: Where do I find course descriptions?    A. Descriptions of all courses can be found in the NYU Bulletin available from the admissions office.    Q: What if I want to switch tracks after I am enrolled?    A. Because each track shares a core of identical courses, it is possible to switch tracks without significantly extending the duration of study and with no or little expense.    Q: Can I still perform?    A. The mission and vision of our program rests on the belief that pedagogy, research and artistic development are intertwined. Therefore, our students&rsquo; artistic development is encouraged. Along with core artistry/creative inquiry courses that aim to stretch one&rsquo;s artistry, we offer a number of extra-curricular performance opportunities.    We produce two concerts annually. The Distinguished Faculty Concert gives students the opportunity to perform in faculty choreography. The M.A. Student Concert is an opportunity to both choreograph and perform in student works. Only NYU students and alumni may perform in our concerts, ensuring that our students will have many performance opportunities.    Kaleidoscope Dancers for Children (doc) is a student performance group that learns repertory, develops new works, designs lesson strategies and performs for Pre-K&ndash;12 students. Each spring, groups of school children attend our studios to closely interact with our dancer/educators. The group also performs in outdoor venues in the city.    Our faculty and alumni often invite our students to perform in professional outside venues. If you want to continue performing professionally, part-time study is an option and some curricular requirements can be fulfilled during summer study. Students may also take two leaves of absence for one semester each to fulfill commitments such as touring.    With our central location in downtown NYC, we advise our students to take advantage the multitude of dance resources that New York City has to offer.    Q: Can I work and still do the program full-time?    A. The Dance Education program is constructed similar to other graduate study in that most of our courses begin in the late afternoon and continue until 9:00 PM. Your advisor will guide you in determining a balance that best supports your needs.

We pursue discipline-based inquiries and scholarly research to increase knowledge and expertise in these domains and to transform the way educators understand and teach dance.    Traditionally, dance is not taught as a domain of understanding; rather, it is taught as received knowledge. Our approach is to move away from a knowledge-centered curriculum &ndash; the &ldquo;passive mind, active body&rdquo; ideal &ndash; wherein submissive learners &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; dance content through a dominant pedagogy. Instead, we provide a curriculum that requires critical and creative thinking about, and deliberate practice with, key concepts in dance, human development and socio-cultural educational settings.    Our &ldquo;thinking-centered&rdquo; approach to dance education necessitates the integration of the developing mind and body in the context of educational/cultural practices. Therefore, our curricular structure is based on three areas of inquiry: 1) discipline-based inquiry which allows the dance artist to master his/her craft, 2) pedagogic-based inquiry that enables deep understanding of teaching and learning processes, and 3) research-based inquiry, which provides theory and methods for creating new knowledge in the field.    Our core courses begin with students developing and examining a personal vision for teaching and learning. Core courses sequence to give students a continual opportunity to integrate their prior-experiences with new knowledge; and culminate in highly individualized projects that evidence the integration of theory and practice. Electives from both inside and outside the program aid students in honing in on particular topics, interests or issues that support their vision. The learning experience in many of our courses is organized around conducting fieldwork in socio-cultural settings such as schools, colleges, institutions and cultural organizations. Through fieldwork, students have the opportunity to analyze educational models, exercise researcher skills, develop professional networks, and to awaken to the realistic idealism that propels the future growth of arts education.    Master of Arts    Our outstanding dance and dance education curriculum prepares graduates to be innovative leaders in dance education. Our Master of Arts degree program has four differentiated tracks, all of which prepare students for doctoral study.    Teaching Dance All Grades &ndash; Initial Certification : This track is for uncertified dance educators interested in teaching dance (grades pre-k through 12) in schools. This track leads to eligibility for a NYS Initial Certificate as a Teacher of Dance, PK-12, with reciprocity in numerous states. (40 credits)    Teaching Dance All Grades &ndash; Professional Certification : This track is for educators who hold an NYS Initial Certificate as a Teacher of Dance (grades pre-k through 12). This track leads to eligibility for a NYS Professional Certificate as a Teacher of Dance (pre-k through 12). This track enriches and expands dance and pedagogical skills and provides options to transition into teaching in higher education. (34 credits)    Teaching Dance in the Professions : This track is for those who wish to teach dance in higher education settings, private studios, schools of dance, conservatories, community outreach, or company-based dance programs. (36 credits)    Teaching Dance in the Professions &ndash; ABT Ballet Pedagogy This concentration area is for those who wish to expand pedagogical knowledge within ballet contexts such as company-based programs, conservatories, private studios, and higher education.

A. The Dance Education Program offers four curricular tracks of study culminating at the M.A. level. The first three tracks share an identical sequence of core courses: Methods &amp; Materials, Improvisation, Composition/Teaching Performance, Technique &amp; Pedagogy, Laban Movement Analysis, Research in Dance Education and Seminar in Dance Education. These core courses are augmented by additional requirements specific to each track as well as selected elective courses.       Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 + Teacher Certification (40 points): For students who wish to attain additional credentials that allow them to teach dance in public schools. These students will complete all requirements for NY State Certification in Dance Pre-K&ndash;12. Reciprocity with other states is available. International students now have the option to be credentialed. Sometimes, students who do not wish to teach in schools full-time, but who wish to develop artist-in-resident programs or after-school programs choose to complete this credential. This is a highly rigorous track with many out-of-program course requirements. Graduates of this track are highly sought after for admission into doctoral programs and for teaching in higher education. Students who do envision moving from a Pre-K&ndash;12 career to a higher education career are encouraged to complete two additional courses in lieu of electives.    Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 (34 points): For the in-service educator who has more than one full-time year of teaching dance on a Initial Dance Certification in Pre-K&ndash;12 schools. Students on this track seek to attain the State required M.A. degree to maintain certification and to enrich and expand their dance and pedagogy skills. Students on this track are interested in advancing their career to attain Staff Development, or Administrative positions in Pre-K&ndash;12 school systems. Many students on this track are concerned with preparing for career transition to doctoral degrees and higher education positions and elect courses with this interest in mind. Students who have certification and one year of full-time teaching in an area other than dance are eligible for Dual Certification (36-40 points).     Teaching Dance in the Professions (36 points): For those who wish to prepare for doctoral study, teach in higher education, or develop and administer dance education programs for cultural institutions or schools of dance. This track is particularly attractive to artists who have been working professionals (performers, choreographers) who find M.F.A. programs redundant to their professional artistry experience. The Professions track students are seeking to build alternative skills in teaching and scholarship and to gain a competitive edge through research in the higher education field. Students graduating from this track are immediately employable for full-time positions at community colleges and for adjunct positions at institutions of higher education. This track is also attractive to students who aim their career toward the \"professions\" by directing education programs at cultural institutions, developing private schools of dance or developing community programs that interface with boards of education.    Teaching Dance: ABT Ballet Pedagogy (36 - 39 points). This newly designed concentration is for students intending to teach in private studios, conservatories, as teaching-artists and community outreach (36 credits). The dance teaching aspect of this curriculum is taught by American Ballet Theatre master teachers who emphasize the development of the ballet dancer. Pedagogy and research are complemented with several arts management courses, preparing the graduate for employment in the private sector. The culminating project of this track is the preparation of a business plan for a private studio. The applicant for this track is an accomplished ballet dancer who wants to develop pedagogical content in this art form. In addition to the MA degree in teaching dance in the professions, the graduate receives an ABT Ballet Pedagogy certificate.       Q: What is the difference between an M.A. and a M.F.A. degree?    A. The Dance Education Program offers a M.A. degree in Dance Education. M.A. degrees are scholarly-oriented degrees that prepare scholars for doctoral study and research inquiry. Scholarly degrees are terminated at the Ph.D. or Ed.D. level.    M.F.A.s are artistry-oriented degrees that aim toward preparing performers or choreographers for the professional field. Artistry-oriented study begins at the B.F.A. level and terminate at the M.F.A. level.    Q: How long do the tracks take?    A. Students have the freedom to determine which semesters they will enroll full-time (12 or more points) or as part-time (9 or less points).       Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 with Teacher Certification (40 points) = 2 years, full-time    Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 (34 point) in-service = 1 1/2 years, full-time    Teaching Dance in the Professions = 1 1/2 years, full-time    Teaching Dance in the Professions with ABT Ballet Pedagogy Concentration = 1 1/2 years, full-time       Q: Can I individualize a curriculum?    A. If you are applying to the M.A. in Teaching Dance in the Professions track, your prior experience will determine how individualized your track can become.    If you are applying to either of the two M. A. in Teaching Dance Pre-K&ndash;12 tracks, these are State Department of Education regulated curriculums that require particular that particular course content be achieved. Both of these tracks do include selected electives which can be individualized to students interests and needs.    All tracks allow for students to take courses out of program. Students can elect from a wide array of courses within the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions and within the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, as well as Gallatin courses and Tisch Performance Studies.    Q: Where do I find course descriptions?    A. Descriptions of all courses can be found in the NYU Bulletin available from the admissions office.    Q: What if I want to switch tracks after I am enrolled?    A. Because each track shares a core of identical courses, it is possible to switch tracks without significantly extending the duration of study and with no or little expense.    Q: Can I still perform?    A. The mission and vision of our program rests on the belief that pedagogy, research and artistic development are intertwined. Therefore, our students&rsquo; artistic development is encouraged. Along with core artistry/creative inquiry courses that aim to stretch one&rsquo;s artistry, we offer a number of extra-curricular performance opportunities.    We produce two concerts annually. The Distinguished Faculty Concert gives students the opportunity to perform in faculty choreography. The M.A. Student Concert is an opportunity to both choreograph and perform in student works. Only NYU students and alumni may perform in our concerts, ensuring that our students will have many performance opportunities.    Kaleidoscope Dancers for Children (doc) is a student performance group that learns repertory, develops new works, designs lesson strategies and performs for Pre-K&ndash;12 students. Each spring, groups of school children attend our studios to closely interact with our dancer/educators. The group also performs in outdoor venues in the city.    Our faculty and alumni often invite our students to perform in professional outside venues. If you want to continue performing professionally, part-time study is an option and some curricular requirements can be fulfilled during summer study. Students may also take two leaves of absence for one semester each to fulfill commitments such as touring.    With our central location in downtown NYC, we advise our students to take advantage the multitude of dance resources that New York City has to offer.    Q: Can I work and still do the program full-time?    A. The Dance Education program is constructed similar to other graduate study in that most of our courses begin in the late afternoon and continue until 9:00 PM. Your advisor will guide you in determining a balance that best supports your needs.

We pursue discipline-based inquiries and scholarly research to increase knowledge and expertise in these domains and to transform the way educators understand and teach dance.    Traditionally, dance is not taught as a domain of understanding; rather, it is taught as received knowledge. Our approach is to move away from a knowledge-centered curriculum &ndash; the &ldquo;passive mind, active body&rdquo; ideal &ndash; wherein submissive learners &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; dance content through a dominant pedagogy. Instead, we provide a curriculum that requires critical and creative thinking about, and deliberate practice with, key concepts in dance, human development and socio-cultural educational settings.    Our &ldquo;thinking-centered&rdquo; approach to dance education necessitates the integration of the developing mind and body in the context of educational/cultural practices. Therefore, our curricular structure is based on three areas of inquiry: 1) discipline-based inquiry which allows the dance artist to master his/her craft, 2) pedagogic-based inquiry that enables deep understanding of teaching and learning processes, and 3) research-based inquiry, which provides theory and methods for creating new knowledge in the field.    Our core courses begin with students developing and examining a personal vision for teaching and learning. Core courses sequence to give students a continual opportunity to integrate their prior-experiences with new knowledge; and culminate in highly individualized projects that evidence the integration of theory and practice. Electives from both inside and outside the program aid students in honing in on particular topics, interests or issues that support their vision. The learning experience in many of our courses is organized around conducting fieldwork in socio-cultural settings such as schools, colleges, institutions and cultural organizations. Through fieldwork, students have the opportunity to analyze educational models, exercise researcher skills, develop professional networks, and to awaken to the realistic idealism that propels the future growth of arts education.    Master of Arts    Our outstanding dance and dance education curriculum prepares graduates to be innovative leaders in dance education. Our Master of Arts degree program has four differentiated tracks, all of which prepare students for doctoral study.    Teaching Dance All Grades &ndash; Initial Certification : This track is for uncertified dance educators interested in teaching dance (grades pre-k through 12) in schools. This track leads to eligibility for a NYS Initial Certificate as a Teacher of Dance, PK-12, with reciprocity in numerous states. (40 credits)    Teaching Dance All Grades &ndash; Professional Certification : This track is for educators who hold an NYS Initial Certificate as a Teacher of Dance (grades pre-k through 12). This track leads to eligibility for a NYS Professional Certificate as a Teacher of Dance (pre-k through 12). This track enriches and expands dance and pedagogical skills and provides options to transition into teaching in higher education. (34 credits)    Teaching Dance in the Professions : This track is for those who wish to teach dance in higher education settings, private studios, schools of dance, conservatories, community outreach, or company-based dance programs. (36 credits)    Teaching Dance in the Professions &ndash; ABT Ballet Pedagogy This concentration area is for those who wish to expand pedagogical knowledge within ballet contexts such as company-based programs, conservatories, private studios, and higher education. This concentration area leads to accreditation with the American Ballet Theatre National Training Curriculum.

Education is the means by which we increase knowledge and develop expertise.    We offer multiple M.A. programs in Dance Education . In our graduate programs, we pursue discipline-based inquiries and scholarly research to increase knowledge and expertise in these domains and to transform the way educators understand and teach dance.    Our place in the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions is of great advantage. Our department houses 400 adjunct and full-time faculty servicing 1,600 students majoring in arts administration, dance education, educational theatre, music business, music composition, music education, music performance, music technology, music theatre, and performing arts therapy. Our multifaceted programs share a spirit of openness and innovation, bringing together traditional and contemporary performing artists and educators in original and collaborative projects.    Our location in the dance capital of the world is of unparalleled advantage. The vibrant artistic energy of New York City provides extraordinary cultural institutions and events, and our Greenwich Village community is home to some of the most famous jazz clubs, experimental performing arts spaces, film venues, and art galleries in the world. Only our university in our city will provide you with the opportunities to interact with world-renowned dancers and educators, allowing you to develop the personal and professional relationships that will prepare you to lead the field of dance education into the 21st century.
