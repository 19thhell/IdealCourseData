The skills and perspectives of the liberal   arts are practical as well as personally enriching. Liberal arts   students can enhance their preparedness for business by also completing a   small number of applicable courses. In consultation with the   Undergraduate College of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, the   College of Arts and Science has identified a set of such courses, some   offered by CAS and some offered by Stern. By completing the Business   Studies minor, students acquire core knowledge and quantitative skills   that are invaluable assets for success in the business professions.      Intended especially for students interested in the humanities, the   minor in Business Studies is administered by the College of Arts and   Science and is available to all students in the University. Students   considering the minor should consult with the Business Studies Advisor   in the College Preprofessional Advising Center. This person's   responsibilities include advising prospective and declared minors,   evaluating the applicability of transfer credit, approving course   substitutions when warranted, and liaising with Stern.      A Business or Liberal Arts Education?            A business degree offers valuable preparation for positions in   business at both the entry and executive levels. Many executives,   however, feel that today's complex corporate environment requires skills   that are not necessarily developed in the undergraduate business or MBA   curriculum: cultural awareness, critical reading skills, creative and   logical thinking, solid writing proficiency, and the ability to   understand and interact with people. A liberal arts education develops   these skills to the fullest.           A recent CAS English major is now an analyst at Morgan Stanley; a   Politics major is now a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers; and a   Journalism student is a production assistant at Simon and Schuster. In   2007-2008, the jobs listed by the Wasserman Center for Career   Development numbered well over 37,000 (9,000 part-time jobs, 8,400   internship opportunities, and more than 20,000 full-time jobs), and over   88% of CAS students held part-time jobs or internships during this   time. The hottest fields were management consulting, software and   website design, health care, and financial services.           The College prepares students very well for today's and tomorrow's   world of work. This is done through courses which develop fundamental   skills (i.e., the Business Studies minor) and by providing integral   professional experiences that employers look for in their candidates,   such as internships or part-time work, opportunities for leadership and   service, and international study.            Courses            Skills which are important for a business career fall into four basic   categories: quantitative and computational, critical and analytical   thinking, communication (both oral and written), and   collaborative/interpersonal skills. By completing a liberal arts degree,   students address all of these skill sets. The MAP, for instance,   provides opportunities to analyze, write, discuss, and compute.            In addition, the Business Studies minor provides liberal arts   students with a small number of applicable courses, some offered by CAS   and some offered by the Stern School of Business. By completing the   minor, students acquire core knowledge and quantitative skills that are   invaluable assets for success in the business professions.             Internships and Employment Experience            Through the Wasserman Center for Career Development, students have   access to about 20,000 internship and part-time employment   opportunities. The Wasserman Center also provides individual career   counseling and offers workshops on a variety of topics including   self-assessment, career decision making, resume writing, interviewing   skills, and job hunting. Finally, the Wasserman Center offers On Campus   Recruitment where organizations from a wide variety of for profit and   non-profit industries visit the Wasserman Center and interview   undergraduate students for full-time employment after graduation.             Leadership and Service            Extracurricular activities such as undergraduate clubs and   publications, advisory boards, student government, and athletic teams   offer students the chance to show their ability to work together, manage   projects, take initiative, budget resources, and obtain results.   Similarly, community service demonstrates concern for others, a quality   which is essential to being both a leader and a team player in any   organization, and is also increasingly important to both public and   private sector employers. For information on volunteering, please   contact the Office of   Civic Engagement .             International Study            In a world where organizations are increasingly multinational in   their personnel, structures, and activities, a multicultural, global   perspective is essential. In addition to language and area studies   courses, NYU offers the opportunity for study abroad.
