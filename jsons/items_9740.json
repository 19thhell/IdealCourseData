Why do PC's have the properties that they do?   Why, regardless of the languages that contributed to their development, do PC's   share so many properties?   This course examines conflicting theories of PC genesis. It explores PC properties, considering in   particular what these languages can tell us about Universal Grammar and about contact linguistics. As   PC genesis is seen as a prime example of the impact of social setting on language, special attention will   be paid to the sociocultural matrix in which PC's develop.        Assignments and Grading      In the course of the semester there will be four assignments. For each assignment, it is necessary to get John's approval of a topic before proceeding. The assignments have the following weight:              First assignment    due 9/25    5%             Second assignment    due 10/17    20%             Third assignment    due 11/20    5%             Fourth assignment    due 12/18    50%         The first three assignments all involve in-class presentations, ten minutes for the first, fifteen minutes for   the second and third. You are expected to adhere strictly to the time requirement.     A note to auditors: I reserve the right to give assignments to auditors. It is my expectation that   I will ask each auditor to give a report in either the second or third cycle of reports, with the auditor choosing   whether to do the second assignment or the third.     First assignment: In this assignment you will report on properties of a particular PC; each student   will select a PC on the first day of class and then present the report on September 25. You will present a   ten-minute report to the class on this speech variety. While you will not be handing in a written version of the   assignment, you will be expected to prepare an informative handout and to base your class presentation upon   it. The handout should contain pertinent examples, a summary of the information you are presenting, and a list   of references.     Second assignment: In this assignment you will expand on your first assignment to report on a    group of PC's. The grouping can be based on geography, e.g. African PC's; shared linguistic history,   e.g. Dutch-lexicon PC's, or type, e.g. fort PC's.) Your primary task here is to summarize, synthesize, and   evaluate relevant articles in producing a paper of four or five pages. In addition, you should prepare a handout   for a class presentation (fifteen minutes).     Third assignment: In this assignment you will present a cross-creole study of a particular linguistic   feature or topic. In a paper of five to seven pages, you will describe the phenomenon under study, show what   makes it noteworthy, and explicate any controversy that surrounds its analysis. Again, you should prepare a   handout for a class presentation (fifteen minutes). A list of possible topics is given below, but you should not   feel restricted to items on this list:              agreement    optimality    relativization          the creation of the lexicon phonotactics semantics          discourse pluralization the status of adjectives          focus pragmatics substrate influence          minimality pronoun systems syllable structure          morphology prosody typology          negation reduplication universals          non-standard varieties of the lexifier language                  Fourth assignment: The final assignment is a term paper that either addresses a topic within   PC studies or brings PC evidence to bear on a broader linguistic issue. If relevant, it may draw on work   that you have done in one or more of the previous assignments for the course. This paper is to be roughly   ten pages in length.     A non-graded but required assignment: Approximately six times during the course I will send   you a question or problem via e-mail. There will be a deadline for each of these assignments. A rule that   I will expect each member of the class to adhere to is the following: you are to spend no more than thirty   minutes in answering the question. That is, from the time you start thinking about the answer to the time   your completed answer is e-mailed to me, you are not to spend more than half an hour working on the question.     Another non-graded but required assignment: Students will subscribe to Creolist and will be   expected to come to class each week having read everything that has appeared on Creolist that week. (Like   other lists, Creolist often contains intemperate language, raging egos, profound irrelevancies, and naked idiocy.  You have been warned.)

These languages arose in particular types of contact situations. While these lang-uages drew most of their vocabulary from the language of the group who held political and economic power, their syntax and much of their phonology are distinct. Thus, even though an overwhelming majority of the words in Haitian Cr\u00e9ole come from French, someone who speaks only French will be unable to understand someone who speaks only Haitian Cr\u00e9ole.      Moreover, whatever the language of power that provides an individual pidgin and creole with its lexicon, e.g. French for Haiti, English for Jamaica, pidgins/creoles across the board show striking similarities to one another. Consequently, the two lines of inquiry that dominate pidgin and creole studies are these:         How did individual pidgins and creoles come into being? and    Why do pidgins and creoles have so much in common?         For many aspects of linguistic theory, pidgins and creoles constitute an exceptional case, a perennial counterexample. As a result, answers to the two basic questions, i.e. explaining pidgin/creole genesis and accounting for the shared features of pidgins/creoles, have implications for broader issues in linguistics. Pidgins/Creoles are seen as especially important for the study of language evolution, on the one hand, and the study of language contact, on the other.      This course will acquaint students with the basic properties of pidgin and creole languages, and it will explore the ways in which evidence from pidgins/creoles bear upon critical issues in linguistics more generally. An important aspect of the course will be the hands-on examination of particular pidgins and creoles. Students will work with data from pidginized Vernacular Liberian English, Bahamian Creole English, and other pidginized/ creolized varieties, including Haitian Cr\u00e9ole.      Instructors      Professor John Victor Singler has published extensively on pidginized Vernacular Liberian English and on the historical matrix that gave rise to the creoles of Haiti, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. He is past president of the Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, co-editor of the forthcoming Handbook of Pidgin and Creole Studies (Malden, MA: Blackwell), co-editor of the Creole Language Library series (Amsterdam: John Benjamins), and a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages.      K. Chanti Seymour is a Ph.D. student in NYU's Department of Linguistics and a faculty member in the Department of English at the College of the Bahamas. Her research focuses both on the structure of Bahamian Creole English (BCE) and on BCE's interaction with standard English.

Why do PC's have the properties that they do?   Why, regardless of the languages that contributed to their development, do PC's   share so many properties?   This course examines conflicting theories of PC genesis. It explores PC properties, considering in   particular what these languages can tell us about Universal Grammar and about contact linguistics. As   PC genesis is seen as a prime example of the impact of social setting on language, special attention will   be paid to the sociocultural matrix in which PC's develop.        Assignments and Grading      In the course of the semester there will be four assignments. For each assignment, it is necessary to get John's approval of a topic before proceeding. The assignments have the following weight:              First assignment    due 9/25    5%             Second assignment    due 10/17    20%             Third assignment    due 11/20    5%             Fourth assignment    due 12/18    50%         The first three assignments all involve in-class presentations, ten minutes for the first, fifteen minutes for   the second and third. You are expected to adhere strictly to the time requirement.     A note to auditors: I reserve the right to give assignments to auditors. It is my expectation that   I will ask each auditor to give a report in either the second or third cycle of reports, with the auditor choosing   whether to do the second assignment or the third.     First assignment: In this assignment you will report on properties of a particular PC; each student   will select a PC on the first day of class and then present the report on September 25. You will present a   ten-minute report to the class on this speech variety. While you will not be handing in a written version of the   assignment, you will be expected to prepare an informative handout and to base your class presentation upon   it. The handout should contain pertinent examples, a summary of the information you are presenting, and a list   of references.     Second assignment: In this assignment you will expand on your first assignment to report on a    group of PC's. The grouping can be based on geography, e.g. African PC's; shared linguistic history,   e.g. Dutch-lexicon PC's, or type, e.g. fort PC's.) Your primary task here is to summarize, synthesize, and   evaluate relevant articles in producing a paper of four or five pages. In addition, you should prepare a handout   for a class presentation (fifteen minutes).     Third assignment: In this assignment you will present a cross-creole study of a particular linguistic   feature or topic. In a paper of five to seven pages, you will describe the phenomenon under study, show what   makes it noteworthy, and explicate any controversy that surrounds its analysis. Again, you should prepare a   handout for a class presentation (fifteen minutes). A list of possible topics is given below, but you should not   feel restricted to items on this list:              agreement    optimality    relativization          the creation of the lexicon phonotactics semantics          discourse pluralization the status of adjectives          focus pragmatics substrate influence          minimality pronoun systems syllable structure          morphology prosody typology          negation reduplication universals          non-standard varieties of the lexifier language                  Fourth assignment: The final assignment is a term paper that either addresses a topic within   PC studies or brings PC evidence to bear on a broader linguistic issue. If relevant, it may draw on work   that you have done in one or more of the previous assignments for the course. This paper is to be roughly   ten pages in length.     A non-graded but required assignment: Approximately six times during the course I will send   you a question or problem via e-mail. There will be a deadline for each of these assignments. A rule that   I will expect each member of the class to adhere to is the following: you are to spend no more than thirty   minutes in answering the question. That is, from the time you start thinking about the answer to the time   your completed answer is e-mailed to me, you are not to spend more than half an hour working on the question.     Another non-graded but required assignment: Students will subscribe to Creolist and will be   expected to come to class each week having read everything that has appeared on Creolist that week. (Like   other lists, Creolist often contains intemperate language, raging egos, profound irrelevancies, and naked idiocy.  You have been warned.)      Information from http://www.ling.su.se/creole/creolist.shtml#Subscribe   as to how to subscribe:   Send an empty e-mail to CreoLIST@ling.su.se. Type %SUBSCRIBE in the subject line, and nothing   else. Leave the body of the e-mail empty. Remember that this message will be processed by a machine;   and do not write anything but this very word, and do not forget the initial %-sign. The machine does not   understand things like \"Dear Mailserver\"; it simply doesn't speak English, or any other human language   for that matter.     The list server will register you as a member and issue a welcome letter shortly after your   subscription, and from then on you may post messages to CreoLIST and you will receive all   CreoLIST postings.

These languages arose in particular types of contact situations. While these lang-uages drew most of their vocabulary from the language of the group who held political and economic power, their syntax and much of their phonology are distinct. Thus, even though an overwhelming majority of the words in Haitian Cr\u00e9ole come from French, someone who speaks only French will be unable to understand someone who speaks only Haitian Cr\u00e9ole.      Moreover, whatever the language of power that provides an individual pidgin and creole with its lexicon, e.g. French for Haiti, English for Jamaica, pidgins/creoles across the board show striking similarities to one another. Consequently, the two lines of inquiry that dominate pidgin and creole studies are these:         How did individual pidgins and creoles come into being? and    Why do pidgins and creoles have so much in common?         For many aspects of linguistic theory, pidgins and creoles constitute an exceptional case, a perennial counterexample. As a result, answers to the two basic questions, i.e. explaining pidgin/creole genesis and accounting for the shared features of pidgins/creoles, have implications for broader issues in linguistics. Pidgins/Creoles are seen as especially important for the study of language evolution, on the one hand, and the study of language contact, on the other.      This course will acquaint students with the basic properties of pidgin and creole languages, and it will explore the ways in which evidence from pidgins/creoles bear upon critical issues in linguistics more generally. An important aspect of the course will be the hands-on examination of particular pidgins and creoles. Students will work with data from pidginized Vernacular Liberian English, Bahamian Creole English, and other pidginized/ creolized varieties, including Haitian Cr\u00e9ole.      Instructors      Professor John Victor Singler has published extensively on pidginized Vernacular Liberian English and on the historical matrix that gave rise to the creoles of Haiti, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. He is past president of the Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, co-editor of the forthcoming Handbook of Pidgin and Creole Studies (Malden, MA: Blackwell), co-editor of the Creole Language Library series (Amsterdam: John Benjamins), and a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages.      K. Chanti Seymour is a Ph.D. student in NYU's Department of Linguistics and a faculty member in the Department of English at the College of the Bahamas. Her research focuses both on the structure of Bahamian Creole English (BCE) and on BCE's interaction with standard English.
