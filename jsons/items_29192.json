Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the instructor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as, but not limited to, music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing.     Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up an independent study. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:       Students should discuss with their faculty adviser the possibility of conducting an independent study.   Generate a basic idea: a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme, or a creative skill.   Identify an appropriate instructor: the student's faculty adviser or Gallatin class adviser; a member of the Gallatin faculty or other NYU faculty; and with special approval, a professor from another university or college. Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work.   Complete and submit the Independent Study Proposal form for review and approval by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.   Identify an alternate course to take in case the proposal is not approved.         Policy for Undergraduate Students     Generally, the work for an independent study should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the student and the instructor who will evaluate it. They may choose several short papers, or a longer paper written in sections as the work progresses and depending on the nature of the study, video productions, paintings or music productions may be appropriate. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.   Independent studies may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed.     Instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours).   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Undergraduate students therefore may register for no more than 8 credits per semester in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.   While independent study provides students with the opportunity to work one-on-one with an instructor, in general, long distance independent studies are not permitted.   Students enrolled in another NYU school are generally not permitted to apply for a Gallatin Independent Study. In rare instances a student from another NYU school might be able to take a Gallatin Independent Study with a Gallatin professor. In all cases, students should contact KatheAnn Joseph for more information.   Students are expected to adhere to the proposal submission deadline .

Gallatin students take courses at Gallatin and in the various schools of NYU and work one-on-one with a faculty adviser to design a plan of self-directed education. One of the first schools in the country to allow students to take on the exciting challenge of shaping their own curriculum, Gallatin helps students draw on the vast resources of NYU and New York City, and encourages them to benefit from practical experience, including internships and independent studies.                                                            The History of Ideas and Significant World Texts                                 Undergraduates experience a thorough grounding in the history of ideas and significant world texts, and graduate students pursue advanced study in interdisciplinary modes of thought. Creating your own program requires maturity, motivation and independence. Students seeking a combination of flexible options and an academic challenge are natural Gallatin candidates.                                                              The Birth of Gallatin                                 The Gallatin School grew out of the educational reform movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period when social forces were bringing new populations of students to higher education. Gallatin was created to respond to the needs and interests of a special kind of student \u2014 focused, self-disciplined and creative. Some were accomplished professionals and people with broad life experiences, and the University recognized that they wanted to exercise more personal freedom in designing individual paths of study.   For more than 40 years, the Gallatin approach has continued to attract a wide variety of bright, talented students with its flexible but academically rigorous curriculum, its innovative, interdisciplinary approach to education, outstanding teachers and advisers and small college atmosphere.                                                              Faculty Advisers                                 The key to Gallatin's educational approach is its faculty advisers. Your adviser ensures that your program has depth, breadth and coherence, and that it is consistent with your professional and educational goals. Advisers also supervise and evaluate independent studies and internship projects and advise graduate students on their theses.                                                              New York City as Your Classroom                                 Along with academic course work, internships, private lessons in the arts and independent studies can be essential parts of your education at Gallatin. All of New York City becomes your classroom: you can intern at a publishing company, a television station, a museum, a hospital or a theater. Besides helping you decide if a particular field is right for you, these internships provide firsthand experience that can often lead to a full-time position after graduation. Through independent study, you can design your own project and work one-on-one with a professor who is an expert in the field. As a small college within a highly regarded research university, Gallatin provides its students with the best of both worlds. Our small size creates a strong sense of community among students and faculty and allows you to develop lasting relationships with your professors, advisers and classmates. At the same time, access to all of New York University means that you have virtually unlimited resources \u2014 a wide variety of courses taught by world-renowned scholars, excellent facilities and research institutes and all of the resources of New York City at your doorstep                            top of page                            Location:   New York, NY      Right on the corner of Broadway and Washington Place in New York City's Greenwich Village                                             Did You Know?

Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the instructor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as, but not limited to, music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing.     Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up an independent study. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:       Students should discuss with their faculty adviser the possibility of conducting an independent study.   Generate a basic idea: a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme, or a creative skill.   Identify an appropriate instructor: the student's faculty adviser or Gallatin class adviser; a member of the Gallatin faculty or other NYU faculty; and with special approval, a professor from another university or college. Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work.   Complete and submit the Independent Study Proposal form for review and approval by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.   Identify an alternate course to take in case the proposal is not approved.         Policy for Undergraduate Students     Generally, the work for an independent study should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the student and the instructor who will evaluate it. They may choose several short papers, or a longer paper written in sections as the work progresses and depending on the nature of the study, video productions, paintings or music productions may be appropriate. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.   Independent studies may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed.     Instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours).   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Undergraduate students therefore may register for no more than 8 credits per semester in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.   While independent study provides students with the opportunity to work one-on-one with an instructor, in general, long distance independent studies are not permitted.   Students enrolled in another NYU school are generally not permitted to apply for a Gallatin Independent Study. In rare instances a student from another NYU school might be able to take a Gallatin Independent Study with a Gallatin professor. In all cases, students should contact KatheAnn Joseph for more information.   Students are expected to adhere to the proposal submission deadline . The completed independent study proposal consists of:     adviser\u2019s approval   instructor\u2019s approval   completed proposal form   description of the study   syllabus   booklist     Please note that independent studies do not fulfill any area of the Gallatin foundation requirement (liberal arts requirement or historical and cultural requirement).         Students interested in pursuing an independent study should review the Independent Study Proposal Guidelines and the Student Checklist .   Instructors for a Gallatin Independent Study should read the Instructor Guidelines .                    top of page                           Quick Links                 Independent Study Proposal Guidelines Student Checklist Individualized Projects Deadlines Instructor Guidelines                                                                                      NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Gallatin students take courses at Gallatin and in the various schools of NYU and work one-on-one with a faculty adviser to design a plan of self-directed education. One of the first schools in the country to allow students to take on the exciting challenge of shaping their own curriculum, Gallatin helps students draw on the vast resources of NYU and New York City, and encourages them to benefit from practical experience, including internships and independent studies.                                                            The History of Ideas and Significant World Texts                                 Undergraduates experience a thorough grounding in the history of ideas and significant world texts, and graduate students pursue advanced study in interdisciplinary modes of thought. Creating your own program requires maturity, motivation and independence. Students seeking a combination of flexible options and an academic challenge are natural Gallatin candidates.                                                              The Birth of Gallatin                                 The Gallatin School grew out of the educational reform movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period when social forces were bringing new populations of students to higher education. Gallatin was created to respond to the needs and interests of a special kind of student \u2014 focused, self-disciplined and creative. Some were accomplished professionals and people with broad life experiences, and the University recognized that they wanted to exercise more personal freedom in designing individual paths of study.   For more than 40 years, the Gallatin approach has continued to attract a wide variety of bright, talented students with its flexible but academically rigorous curriculum, its innovative, interdisciplinary approach to education, outstanding teachers and advisers and small college atmosphere.                                                              Faculty Advisers                                 The key to Gallatin's educational approach is its faculty advisers. Your adviser ensures that your program has depth, breadth and coherence, and that it is consistent with your professional and educational goals. Advisers also supervise and evaluate independent studies and internship projects and advise graduate students on their theses.                                                              New York City as Your Classroom                                 Along with academic course work, internships, private lessons in the arts and independent studies can be essential parts of your education at Gallatin. All of New York City becomes your classroom: you can intern at a publishing company, a television station, a museum, a hospital or a theater. Besides helping you decide if a particular field is right for you, these internships provide firsthand experience that can often lead to a full-time position after graduation. Through independent study, you can design your own project and work one-on-one with a professor who is an expert in the field. As a small college within a highly regarded research university, Gallatin provides its students with the best of both worlds. Our small size creates a strong sense of community among students and faculty and allows you to develop lasting relationships with your professors, advisers and classmates. At the same time, access to all of New York University means that you have virtually unlimited resources \u2014 a wide variety of courses taught by world-renowned scholars, excellent facilities and research institutes and all of the resources of New York City at your doorstep                            top of page                            Location:   New York, NY      Right on the corner of Broadway and Washington Place in New York City's Greenwich Village                                             Did You Know?

A written proposal must be submitted to and approved by the instructor, then submitted to the Office of Academic Services before a student may register. The written proposal ordinarily is at least two pages double-spaced (or at least 1,000 words) and should describe the subject matter of the Directed Research and the issues the student intends to explore in the paper. The student may register by using an add/drop form that Academic Services will supply upon receipt of the signed proposal within the stated deadlines. Directed research credits may be added through September 30 for Fall 2014 and February 10 for Spring 2015 . The usual allocation is two credits. A student may write a one-credit Directed Research but it will not suffice for the Substantial Writing requirement satisfaction . A three-credit Directed Research project is highly unusual and requires the approval of the Vice Dean. Students considering this should contact Academic Services. Also note that requests to late add Directed Research will only be considered if your credit load (not including the Directed Research credits) does not drop below the minimum 12 credits at any point in the semester after the add/drop period. Students who are granted permission to late add Directed Research will not be permitted to drop classes if the result is inconsistent with the above, so please plan your schedule accordingly.   You may ask any full-time faculty member or visiting faculty member to supervise Directed Research. Adjunct professors may supervise Directed Research only with permission of the Vice Dean. A two-credit Directed Research may satisfy the Substantial Writing requirement. Failure to make academic progress on a Directed Research may result in a student\u2019s withdrawal with a grade of \u201cWD.\u201d   After March 15 of the student\u2019s final semester , no faculty member may accept a request from a student to perform directed research or other work for law school credit unless the student has first received the approval of the Vice Dean. The Vice Dean may allow such work if the student needs the credit for May graduation and July bar certification subject to the following:     No more than two (2) credits can be earned in this manner.   In making his or her decision, the Vice Dean shall consider (a) the date of the student\u2019s request; (b) the nature of the proposal; and (c) whether the missing credits or the timing of the student\u2019s request are the result of circumstances that were within the student\u2019s ability to avoid. Failure of the student to properly calculate his or her credits at an earlier time, failure in a course, and removal from a course for excessive absences are examples of circumstances within the student\u2019s control to avoid.   If the missing credits result from circumstances outside the student\u2019s control, the Vice Dean will permit the credit if at all academically reasonable.   If the Vice Dean approves the student\u2019s application, it will be the student\u2019s responsibility to find a faculty member willing to supervise the student\u2019s proposed work and award the credit in a timely manner.     JD students can use a two-credit Directed Research to satisfy the Substantial Writing requirement.
