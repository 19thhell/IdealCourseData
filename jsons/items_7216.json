It no longer revolves exclusively around Hollywood, or even the U.S. There are growing and thriving Film Industries throughout the International map, with foreign directors, writers, and actors becoming artistically and commercially successful on a world wide basis. Films indigenous to their own nations are gaining an increasingly large share of their local box office pies, and opportunities abound around the world for new filmmakers to gain entry and thrive in foreign lands. Many US films are earning a disproportionate share of their total revenues overseas. Foreign financing is evolving into an essential component of funds available to make films anywhere in the world; including the U.S. For a film student hoping to get their films made an understanding of how industry works on a worldwide basis; is a key element in having a successful film career. The course will examine the historical changes that have occurred in the foreign markets and attempt to forecast where the business is headed internationally. Most importantly the course is designed to create an awareness in graduate film students as how to access jobs in foreign countries.

It no longer revolves exclusively around Hollywood, or even the U.S. There are growing and thriving Film Industries throughout the International map, with foreign directors, writers, and actors becoming artistically and commercially successful on a world wide basis. Films indigenous to their own nations are gaining an increasingly large share of their local box office pies, and opportunities abound around the world for new filmmakers to gain entry and thrive in foreign lands. Many US films are earning a disproportionate share of their total revenues overseas. Foreign financing is evolving into an essential component of funds available to make films anywhere in the world; including the U.S. For a film student hoping to get their films made an understanding of how industry works on a worldwide basis; is a key element in having a successful film career. The course will examine the historical changes that have occurred in the foreign markets and attempt to forecast where the business is headed internationally. Most importantly the course is designed to create an awareness in graduate film students as how to access jobs in foreign countries.
