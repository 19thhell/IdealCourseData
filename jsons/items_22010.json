Kellman Monday and Wednesday, 3-5:00pm This course is an introduction to the fundamental concepts of Modern   Dance technique that focuses on the dynamic rapport between body-mind   knowledge and expression. In movement, students will become more aware   and organized in their bodies. They will explore certain aesthetic   characteristics that help to define dance material as \u201cModern\u201d or   contemporary. Through structured improvisation and teamwork approaches   students will learn to dance from the inside out, exercise choice with   imagination and work together as an ensemble. Ultimately, students will   gain an appreciation for the expressive capacity of the body,   recognizing shared, unifying attributes and those that are unique and   intrinsic to each individual. Some techniques utilized will be Lim\u00f3n,   Bartenieff and Doris Humphrey. Students interested in taking this course as noncredit should register for NCRD-UT 804.
