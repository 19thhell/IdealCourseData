Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez is the Department Chairman, and there are 32 plastic surgeons and associated specialists in head and neck surgery, orthodontics, prosthodontics, and psychology on faculty.   Comprehensive training is achieved by rotations through six hospitals: NYU Langone Medical Center, Bellevue Hospital, Manhattan Eye, Ear, and Throat Hospital, the Manhattan Veterans Administration Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the Burn Unit at New York Hospital.   Residents obtain exposure to all aspects of plastic surgery including: aesthetic surgery, breast reconstruction, cleft lip and palate surgery, craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery, extremity reconstruction, facial trauma, hand surgery, head and neck reconstruction, microsurgery, non-surgical aesthetics, and ophthalmic plastic surgery. Each resident performs approximately eight hundred to a thousand surgical procedures in each year of training. The program is accredited for three years and graduates four chiefs per year. There are three Integrated residency positions and one \"traditional\" Independent residency position per year.   Requirements   Candidates are referred to the ACGME and American Board of Plastic Surgery (www.abplsurg.org ) websites for current eligibility requirements.   Applications   For applications to the Integrated program visit www.aamc.org/eras and click on the ERAS Registration Link. You will need your medical school ID and password.   Applications to the \"traditional\" Independent program are made through the San Francisco matching program .   The Program   The Plastic and Hand Surgery Services at our six hospital training sites run an average of 25-30 operating rooms each day, and the inpatient census approximates 50-75 beds. All major teaching sites have active resident clinics.   In addition to bedside, operating room, and clinic teaching, educational activities include formal conferences, weekly lectures, visiting professorships and guest lectures, and attendance at special courses and symposia organized by members of the Department of Plastic Surgery including the annual Cutting Edge Aesthetic Symposium and NYU Breast Symposium.   All residents are encouraged to participate in clinical and basic science research, and the Department provides financial support for resident paper presentations at regional and national meetings. Moreover, residents are sent, at the Department's expense, to the American Association of Plastic Surgeons annual meeting, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons annual meeting. As of 2015, an on-site dedicated cadaver laboratory hosts cadaver dissection courses. Fully equipped laboratories are available for research in composite tissue allotransplantation, microsurgery, wound healing, craniofacial growth and development, computer imaging, and fat grafting.   The Department's Bogert Education center, the hub of our didactic program, boasts a collection of landmark books and journals, is fully connected to NYU School of Medicine's comprehensive electronic library, and houses conference rooms and a microsurgery laboratory.   The Department graduates four residents per year, three from the six-year Integrated pathway and one from the three-year Independent pathway. The Integrated pathway is open to applicants who have completed prerequisite medical degree training at an ACGME approved institution. The three-year Independent pathway is open to applicants who have completed prerequisite surgical training as defined by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. There are thus three residents in each of the first three years of training and four residents in each of the final three years.   Integrated Pathway   The six-year integrated training program is designed to provide each resident with progressive responsibility and the fullest possible experience in all areas of plastic surgery.   Following the Integrated training paradigm, the first three years of residency training are spent completing 15 months of Core Surgery rotations, 9 months of rotations defined as \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d by the Plastic Surgery RRC and 12 months dedicated to Plastic &amp; Hand Surgery rotations. The \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d rotations include: Anesthesia, Dermatology, ENT, Orthopedics, Oral &amp; Maxillofacial and Occuloplastic Surgery. The Core Surgery rotations include: Breast &amp; Oncologic Surgery, Abdominal &amp; Alimentary, Pediatric, Vascular, Cardiothoracic, Transplant, and Minimally Invasive Surgery, Trauma and Critical Care, and Emergency Medicine.   In the fourth year, residents rotate for periods of three months on each of the following: Plastic Surgery Service at NYU Langone Medical Center, Plastic Surgery Service at Bellevue Hospital, Hand Surgery Service at Bellevue Hospital and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.   During the fifth year, residents spend three months as Chief Resident at both the Manhattan Eye Ear &amp; Throat Hospital and the Manhattan VA Hospital/Bellevue Hand Surgery Service and rotate for six months on the Plastic Surgery Service at NYU Langone Medical Center.   By design, the Chief/sixth year is structured similarly to the fourth year. The resident serves as Chief Resident for three months on each of the following: Plastic Surgery Service at NYU Langone Medical Center, Plastic Surgery Service at Bellevue Hospital, Hand Service at Bellevue Hospital and the outpatient NYU Aesthetic Surgery Service.   Rotation schedule for the six-year Integrated Residency Training Program.   Independent Pathway   The three-year Independent training pathway is identical to the fourth, fifth and Chief/sixth years of the Integrated pathway, with the exception that 1 month is spent at the Cornell/New York Hospital Burn Unit during the first year.   Rotation schedule for the three-year Independent Residency Training Program.   Housing   NYU School of Medicine subsidized housing is available to plastic surgery residents. Residents matching from out of the region receive priority while wait-listed residents generally receive subsidized housing after the first academic year. NYU School of Medicine compensation is relatively generous in recognition of the regional cost of housing and most residents live in off-campus apartments.   Faculty Members   Eduardo D.

The Program   The Plastic and Hand Surgery Services at our six hospital training sites run an average of 25-30 operating rooms each day, and the inpatient census approximates 50-75 beds. All major teaching sites have active resident clinics.   In addition to bedside, operating room, and clinic teaching, educational activities include formal conferences, weekly lectures, visiting professorships and guest lectures, and attendance at special courses and symposia organized by members of the Department of Plastic Surgery including the annual Cutting Edge Aesthetic Symposium and NYU Breast Symposium.   All residents are encouraged to participate in clinical and basic science research, and the Department provides financial support for resident paper presentations at regional and national meetings. Moreover, residents are sent, at the Department's expense, to the American Association of Plastic Surgeons annual meeting, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons annual meeting. As of 2015, an on-site dedicated cadaver laboratory hosts cadaver dissection courses. Fully equipped laboratories are available for research in composite tissue allotransplantation, microsurgery, wound healing, craniofacial growth and development, computer imaging, and fat grafting.   The Department's Bogert Education center, the hub of our didactic program, boasts a collection of landmark books and journals, is fully connected to NYU School of Medicine's comprehensive electronic library, and houses conference rooms and a microsurgery laboratory.   The Department graduates four residents per year, three from the six-year Integrated pathway and one from the three-year Independent pathway. The Integrated pathway is open to applicants who have completed prerequisite medical degree training at an ACGME approved institution. The three-year Independent pathway is open to applicants who have completed prerequisite surgical training as defined by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. There are thus three residents in each of the first three years of training and four residents in each of the final three years.   Integrated Pathway   The six-year integrated training program is designed to provide each resident with progressive responsibility and the fullest possible experience in all areas of plastic surgery.   Following the Integrated training paradigm, the first three years of residency training are spent completing 15 months of Core Surgery rotations, 9 months of rotations defined as \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d by the Plastic Surgery RRC and 12 months dedicated to Plastic &amp; Hand Surgery rotations. The \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d rotations include: Anesthesia, Dermatology, ENT, Orthopedics, Oral &amp; Maxillofacial and Occuloplastic Surgery. The Core Surgery rotations include: Breast &amp; Oncologic Surgery, Abdominal &amp; Alimentary, Pediatric, Vascular, Cardiothoracic, Transplant, and Minimally Invasive Surgery, Trauma and Critical Care, and Emergency Medicine.   In the fourth year, residents rotate for periods of three months on each of the following: Plastic Surgery Service at NYU Langone Medical Center, Plastic Surgery Service at Bellevue Hospital, Hand Surgery Service at Bellevue Hospital and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.   During the fifth year, residents spend three months as Chief Resident at both the Manhattan Eye Ear &amp; Throat Hospital and the Manhattan VA Hospital/Bellevue Hand Surgery Service and rotate for six months on the Plastic Surgery Service at NYU Langone Medical Center.   By design, the Chief/sixth year is structured similarly to the fourth year. The resident serves as Chief Resident for three months on each of the following: Plastic Surgery Service at NYU Langone Medical Center, Plastic Surgery Service at Bellevue Hospital, Hand Service at Bellevue Hospital and the outpatient NYU Aesthetic Surgery Service.   Rotation schedule for the six-year Integrated Residency Training Program.   Independent Pathway   The three-year Independent training pathway is identical to the fourth, fifth and Chief/sixth years of the Integrated pathway, with the exception that 1 month is spent at the Cornell/New York Hospital Burn Unit during the first year.   Rotation schedule for the three-year Independent Residency Training Program.   Housing   NYU School of Medicine subsidized housing is available to plastic surgery residents. Residents matching from out of the region receive priority while wait-listed residents generally receive subsidized housing after the first academic year. NYU School of Medicine compensation is relatively generous in recognition of the regional cost of housing and most residents live in off-campus apartments.   Faculty Members   Eduardo D.
