ReMu's inaugural Stevie Wonder course, likely the first of its kind anywhere in the world, was an exploration not only of the man's career but an overview of a crucial moment in popular music history: when African-American recording artists - and the times - demanded independence from a producer's system; when, simultaneous with the singer-songwriter and album rock movement, black music found its own voice. Stevie Wonder led the movement, opening the door to new forms of expression, paving the way to creative uses of new technologies, and influencing generations to come. Helping carve a path through the curriculum was Stevie Wonder himself, who surprised everyone with a guest appearance during the first class. Stevie did more than wave hello and move on, he held forth for 30 minutes, telling his story, during which he sang snippets of his songs and took questions from the students. Providing a musical backdrop was DJ Spinna, well known for his successful \"Wonder-full\" nights in NY, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The class also attracted Malcolm Cecil, an electronic music pioneer who was one-half of the original production and engineering team behind the classic Wonder albums Talking Book, Innervisions, et al. He spoke at length about his career and treated the class to an exclusive listening session of side one of Innervisions, direct from the original master tape. In a later class, helping to frame Stevie\u2019s influence, was songwriter-producer Carl Sturken, who with his creative partner Evan Rogers has collaborated with most of the major young pop stars of the last 15 years; most prominently they discovered Rihanna. In class Sturken played songs he co-created, pointing out the obvious and subtle Stevie Wonder influences. The class wound up with an 90-minute Q&amp;A with Ahmir ?uestlove Thompson and Christian McBride. They\u2019re longtime friends who were high school classmates and are unabashed Stevie Wonder fans. They discussed their favorite Wonder moments, both from listening as kids to personal experiences with Stevie himself. They put those moments in historical, political and social contexts, deftly weaving the conversation into a class as unforgettable as the first. And we ended as we began: with DJ Spinna playing the music.

Merging r&amp;b, jazz, rock, classical and pop sounds in innovative and melodious ways, Wonder \u2013 who today boasts 22 Grammy\u00ae Awards to his name \u2013 released in the 1970s an acclaimed string of albums (Music Of My Mind, Talking Book, Innervisions, Fullfillingness\u2019 First Finale, Songs In The Key Of Life) that set the bar for artistic achievement in recorded music. This course introduces students to the life and work of Stevie Wonder, giving students insight into the artistic, business and technological forces that inform his creative output. In learning about Stevie Wonder, students will discover the under-researched black singer-songwriter movement of the \u201960s and \u201970s. Running parallel to the widening of the album rock market in the early 1970s, which inspired the rise of such artists-songwriters as James Taylor, Carole King, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Jackson Browne and Laura Nyro, was the rise of the black singer-songwriter-auteur, keyed by the success of Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Bill Withers, Donny Hathaway, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, and others. It\u2019s a story overlooked by most chroniclers of the era, as R&amp;B and soul music historically has been deemed dance and/or party music; yet the contributions made by these \u201ctriple-threat\u201d artists opened the door for a whole new sound \u2013 sometimes without leaving the dance floor behind. Students will also learn of the technological advances in recorded music that allowed Stevie Wonder a forum for his singular vision. In specifically looking at Wonder, and the range of issues surrounding the creation and release of his 1973 album Innervisions, the class will document this movement, incorporate the artists of this movement into the larger pop music history, and illuminate their contributions as vital to the work of those who followed \u2013 Prince, Rick James, El DeBarge, Babyface, Sade, Maxwell, D\u2019Angelo, India.Arie, Mary J. Blige, John Legend, Jay-Z and more.
