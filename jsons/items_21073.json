Do you want to spend less than 20 hours compiling and formatting the bibliography for your thesis or dissertation?   Have you ever panicked at the thought of citing a tweet in APA style?   Do you have a million article PDFs in a thousand different folders on more than one computer, all named things like \u201cgfc.211005.5.1.56\u201d?   Do you want to learn more about different tools and workflows for managing your research?     If so, make sure to join us in the Grad Exchange (Bobst Library, 10th floor) on April 8, 2015, 3-4:30pm, for \u201cWrangling Your References: Research Management in the Real World,\u201d a panel discussion about different options for research and citation management. Light refreshments will be served! RSVP at\u00a0 http://nyu.libcal.com/event.php?id=936477   Three researchers from different fields will reveal their secrets to making research and writing easier and more effective. Librarians will also be on hand to answer all your questions about personal research management tools like EndNote, Mendeley, RefWorks/FLOW, and Zotero, including which one is right for you.
