An integral part of the IFA since the 1950s, the program prepares students for curatorial careers in specialized fields by strengthening both their connoisseurship and research skills.   The offerings consist of two colloquia that explore different aspects of a curator's professional duties. One of these courses is offered every semester, although the sequence and frequency may vary. The program's third component is an individually arranged nine-month curatorial residency.     While\u00a0Curatorial\u00a0Studies courses are open to both MA and Ph.D students, only Ph.D students are eligible for the 9 month residency and the\u00a0Curatorial\u00a0Studies Certificate. Students in the Curatorial Studies courses receive hands on training in exhibition planning. Past exhibitions that have been featured in these courses are: Man, Myth, and Sensual Pleasures: Jan Gossart's Renaissance ; The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty ; Venice and the Islamic World, 828&ndash;1797 ; and Prague, The Crown of Bohemia, 1347&ndash;1437 .     Curatorial Studies Alumni have held leadership positions at some of the world&rsquo;s foremost art institutions, such as: The Art Institute of Chicago; The Frick Collection; J. Paul Getty Museum; Library of Congress; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; National Gallery, London; Philadelphia Museum of Art; and the Smithsonian Institution.
