The Secret&rsquo;s Out        The Prohibition era may be over, but those who know where  to look can still party like it&rsquo;s 1929. Trevor Cano, an administrative aid for university development and alumni relations, discovered such a watering hole and, even though it&rsquo;s called  Please Don&rsquo;t Tell, or PDT , it&rsquo;s just too good to keep to himself. Tucked inside the East Village frankfurter joint Crif Dogs is an unassuming telephone booth, but dial the right number and&mdash;viola!&mdash;the back wall opens into a modern&ndash;day speakeasy. &ldquo;Suddenly you&rsquo;re right in this really nice, low&ndash;lit bar,&rdquo; Cano says. PDT rewards those who find it with an array of inventive drinks, such as the Hemingway Daiquiri, a white rum, citrus juice, and maraschino liqueur concoction, and the absinthe&ndash;based Corpse Reviver No. 2, which landed on New York magazine&rsquo;s 2008 list of best cocktails. For the hungry, PDT offers waffle fries and hot dogs smothered with bacon, jalapeos, and other decadent toppings, passed from next door through a hole in the wall. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fun concept&mdash;being able to eat your drunk food before you&rsquo;re drunk,&rdquo; Cano says.     113 St. Marks Place, 212&ndash;614&ndash;0386        Say Cheese, New York      Capturing the perfect shot  of New York can be tricky. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in Manhattan, oftentimes you don&rsquo;t see enough to get it,&rdquo; says Mark Jenkinson, associate teacher in the photography and imaging department at the Tisch School of the Arts. &ldquo;If you go to New Jersey, it feels like you&rsquo;re in Jersey and New York is just  in the background.&rdquo; After 30 years as a professional photographer, he returns to one location time and again&mdash;the DUMBO section of Brooklyn. DUMBO, which stands for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass, provides spectacular views of Manhattan, as well as a classic New York icon. &ldquo;The Brooklyn Bridge arches over in this perfect way and, if you&rsquo;re shooting at night, it&rsquo;s got lights,&rdquo; Jenkinson says, which brightens the whole  upper frame. And with its many restaurants, bars, and galleries,  the neighborhood isn&rsquo;t just for the pros, but anyone with a camera. Jenkinson recommends getting there by walking across the bridge or by taking a New York Water Taxi to the Fulton Ferry Landing just west of DUMBO  to snap shots along the way.

So when Debra A. LaMorte, senior vice president for university development and alumni relations, finds time to relax, she heads to SILK DAY SPA off Fifth Avenue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a real oasis,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so serene, it feels like you were swept into another world.&rdquo; With deep red and golden tones, accentuated with bamboo and black stones, the spa exudes Eastern tranquility. LaMorte is partial to its facials and massages, but Silk offers everything from quick fixes, such as the New York Minute Peel&mdash;a half&ndash;hour facial for those on&ndash;the&ndash;go&mdash;to more extravagant specials, such as the Urban Vacation, which combines a body scrub, hot stone massage, and papaya mango wrap. But whatever the treatment, LaMorte says she&rsquo;s always welcomed by clean conditions and impeccable service&mdash;a refreshing change from other spas that can be crowded, noisy, or too pushy with their products. &ldquo;You never feel as though you&rsquo;re on any kind of mass production line,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very individual place.&rdquo;     47 West 13th Street, 212&ndash;255&ndash;6457; www.silkdayspa.com        Double the Dhal        When Krishnendu Ray immigrated to New York, he was plagued  by such nostalgia for Indian home cooking that he switched his  studies from political science  to food. Now an assistant professor of nutrition and food studies  at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human  Development, Ray says what  he misses most are the more subtle  flavors from home. &ldquo;At most Indian restaurants here, the food reeks  of spices,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the nature of commodified cooking. People expect that aggressive spice, and they&rsquo;ll be disappointed otherwise.&rdquo; Still, Caf&eacute; Spice has  become a habit, he confesses,  because of its delicious dhal  and inexpensive prices. The bistro&rsquo;s proximity to campus, on University Place, makes it the perfect spot  to grade papers over a lunch  of lamb thali with curry and rice. For a special treat, however, Ray opts for TABLA . There he can choose from two different dining experiences: The upstairs dining area offers upscale American  cuisine infused with Indian spices and flavors, while the downstairs Bread Bar serves home&ndash;style fare. Ray especially likes the creative twists on some of his favorite dishes, such as the Italian&ndash;inspired rosemary naan and the fish steamed  in banana leaves. &ldquo;They play with the traditional ingredients and spices so that it&rsquo;s stylized,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but it works.&rdquo;    11 Madison Avenue, 212&ndash;889&ndash;0667; www.tablany.com        photos from top &copy;noah kalina, mark jenkinson, silk day spa, bill bettencourt"}, {"content": "Fales Library &amp; Special Collections                                                             ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                         About /          Services /              Archival Collections /          Events &amp; Exhibitions /                       FAQs     Overview     Fales Collection     Downtown Collection     Food Studies     Riot Grrrl Collection     Media Collections     Blog     Donate to Fales                             Archival Collections     Appointments are necessary for all researchers who wish to consult archival and manuscript materials.
