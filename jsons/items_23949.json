The classes follow a seasonal theme and a curriculum that is based on sensory input. Your child will be immersed in fun activities, while learning to identify new and familiar sounds and objects. Interactions and activities include greetings, songs, nursery rhymes, movement, stories, and crafts.  In the Toddler Class (age 3-4) children interact with the language by playing games, making crafts, singing songs, and storytelling. These activities supplement our standard German kindergarten activities especially learning the concepts of same and different, size, opposites, left and right, numbers, colors and more. Seasonal topics are also incorporated into the lesson plan. The Primary Class is for children 5-6. We learn and practice German through playful activities that encourage the kids to communicate in German. The curriculum is filled with activities that encourage language and literacy development in young children, e.g. rhythmic games, playing with syllables and letters. Reading and writing is introduced through games and other supplemental learning materials. The Lower Elementary Class is for children 7-8. We focus on conversation to expand vocabulary and work on Grammar, as well as reading and writing in German. Reading and writing is introduced within the learning topic. Other supplemental learning materials are supporting the reading and writing development as well. The Elementary Class is for children ages 9-10. The focus of this course in conversation, but a strong literacy component ensures that the students not only listen, speak and play in German, but read and write, as well as work on grammar. The topics are chosen according to children's interests to provide a fun yet educational environment similar to schools in Germany. The Upper Elementary Class is for children ages 11-12. The course is for students who are already communicating well, but need to work on grammar and orthography.
