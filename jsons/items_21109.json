Those are the skills taught by the Moral Courage Project (MCP) at NYU Wagner. By developing mastery of the self, leadership through relationships, and strategies for action in moral dilemmas, graduates can ensure both integrity and impact.   Moral Courage in the 21st Century   Moral courage means standing up when others want you to sit down.   Developing moral courage is crucial to authenticity of the self. It equips individuals to discover what is true about their voices, allowing them to deepen that uniqueness. It also empowers individuals to discover what matters to them\u00a0-\u00a0what they stand for -\u00a0even if the price is disapproval from peers or loved ones.   These are central issues for emerging professionals\u00a0today. Humanity's future demands creativity, which in turn requires students to find and cultivate their callings. Purpose and meaning are no longer luxuries; they are necessities in the roller-coaster ride that is a contemporary career. Whether as entrepreneurs, as social change agents, or as both, having impact requires taking risks for life-changing rewards.\u00a0     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     Course Offering:\u00a0 Moral Courage and Your Purpose (PADM-GP 2196)   The Moral Courage Project will\u00a0offer\u00a0its next graduate-level course in the J-term 2015.\u00a0Developed by Irshad Manji , this seminar-style course is driven by Socratic questioning. It emphasizes reflection, interaction and unconventional ways of learning. Be prepared for inspiration and the hard work of using\u00a0it for your purpose.   To learn more, please contact \u00a0 irshad.manji@nyu.edu   Key themes:   Moral Courage   What exactly is moral courage? How has it been exhibited throughout history? Through the Moral Courage Channel on YouTube, we see it being exhibited today. Which raises the next question: Can anybody \u00a0develop moral courage? Finally, why is moral courage a pre-condition of cultivating purpose?   Identity\u00a0   Knowing your identity is a good thing. Or is it? Surprisingly, identity can be a major obstacle to developing\u00a0moral courage and achieving wholeness - or integrity.\u00a0What is the difference between identity and integrity? To grow from identity into integrity, what questions do we\u00a0need to ask ourselves?   Integrity   What does it mean to \"have integrity\"?\u00a0How do we\u00a0know when we\u00a0have it? Why does integrity matter for personal and professional advancement?   Turning Identity Into Integrity   Many successful people have transformed their identity into integrity. As a result, they have served a greater good. What can such people teach us?\u00a0We examine the stories\u00a0of Robert F. Kennedy on the one hand and Oprah Winfrey on the other.   Impact   Gandhi famously said, \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world.\u201d How does self-transformation translate into social impact?\u00a0   The Three I\u2019s Start Within You   Identity, integrity and impact are the three i\u2019s of cultivating purpose. How do these dots connect in your life? Where on this journey will you need moral courage to move forward? What are concrete\u00a0ways in which you can\u00a0sustain your\u00a0moral courage?

The Admissions Committee gives great weight to this essay in evaluating the soundness, feasibility, and focus of your program at Gallatin and to gauge your preparation for the proposed course of study.   Before writing the statement, you should research the other NYU departments and schools in which you plan to take courses. A good way to learn more about course offerings throughout NYU is to use the website of the Office of the University Registrar in tandem with each school\u2019s website. You can go to the registrar\u2019s website and select \u2018Course Search\u2019 to find specific course offerings in each NYU graduate school. Be sure to narrow your search by selecting \u2018Graduate\u2019 under the \u2018Academic Career\u2019 tab on the registrar\u2019s website. You can then visit the websites of individual schools for more information and course descriptions.    There are three parts to the Statement of Purpose:       Your concentration (approximately 800 words). At Gallatin, each student develops an individualized concentration, a program of study organized around a coherent theme or set of questions and drawing on a variety of academic disciplines and professional fields. In this essay, please describe the concentration you hope to pursue. Tell us about such things as the kinds of knowledge and skills you would like to master, the themes and questions that would drive your work, and the disciplines and fields you would integrate into a focused curriculum. You may include how your academic interests relate to your professional and personal goals. If your concentration involves developing professional or artistic skills, tell us about the intellectual questions that would provide context and meaning to those skills. Finally, explain why you have chosen to pursue your graduate work through Gallatin\u2019s individualized study program rather than through other types of programs in your areas of inquiry.   Your qualifications (approximately 300 words). In this section, discuss any academic, professional, or personal experiences that have prepared you for graduate work in this concentration. Expand on your transcript and your resume: flesh them out and add other items in a way that explains your qualifications for undertaking the proposed program of study.Your plan.   Please include a tentative list of specific courses that might constitute your program (keeping in mind that departments often alter their course offerings and that some of your choices might not be available). Note: Your list should include only graduate courses. The only exception is the Department of Film and Television in the Tisch School of the Arts, where Gallatin MA students are permitted to take a maximum of 12 undergraduate units. See the Gallatin website for more details.    If you might want to do independent studies and/or internships, list them as well. Your list should include the departments, course titles and course numbers. If there are particular faculty members with whom you would like to study at Gallatin or elsewhere at NYU, you may mention them here. This section of the application enables us to understand your concentration more clearly.                          top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Those are the skills taught by the Moral Courage Project (MCP) at NYU Wagner. By developing mastery of the self, leadership through relationships, and strategies for action in moral dilemmas, graduates can ensure both integrity and impact.   Moral Courage in the 21st Century   Moral courage means standing up when others want you to sit down.   Developing moral courage is crucial to authenticity of the self. It equips individuals to discover what is true about their voices, allowing them to deepen that uniqueness. It also empowers individuals to discover what matters to them\u00a0-\u00a0what they stand for -\u00a0even if the price is disapproval from peers or loved ones.   These are central issues for emerging professionals\u00a0today. Humanity's future demands creativity, which in turn requires students to find and cultivate their callings. Purpose and meaning are no longer luxuries; they are necessities in the roller-coaster ride that is a contemporary career. Whether as entrepreneurs, as social change agents, or as both, having impact requires taking risks for life-changing rewards.\u00a0     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     Course Offering:\u00a0 Moral Courage and Your Purpose (PADM-GP 2196)   The Moral Courage Project will\u00a0offer\u00a0its next graduate-level course in the J-term 2015.\u00a0Developed by Irshad Manji , this seminar-style course is driven by Socratic questioning. It emphasizes reflection, interaction and unconventional ways of learning. Be prepared for inspiration and the hard work of using\u00a0it for your purpose.   To learn more, please contact \u00a0 irshad.manji@nyu.edu   Key themes:   Moral Courage   What exactly is moral courage? How has it been exhibited throughout history? Through the Moral Courage Channel on YouTube, we see it being exhibited today. Which raises the next question: Can anybody \u00a0develop moral courage? Finally, why is moral courage a pre-condition of cultivating purpose?   Identity\u00a0   Knowing your identity is a good thing. Or is it? Surprisingly, identity can be a major obstacle to developing\u00a0moral courage and achieving wholeness - or integrity.\u00a0What is the difference between identity and integrity? To grow from identity into integrity, what questions do we\u00a0need to ask ourselves?   Integrity   What does it mean to \"have integrity\"?\u00a0How do we\u00a0know when we\u00a0have it? Why does integrity matter for personal and professional advancement?   Turning Identity Into Integrity   Many successful people have transformed their identity into integrity. As a result, they have served a greater good. What can such people teach us?\u00a0We examine the stories\u00a0of Robert F. Kennedy on the one hand and Oprah Winfrey on the other.   Impact   Gandhi famously said, \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world.\u201d How does self-transformation translate into social impact?\u00a0   The Three I\u2019s Start Within You   Identity, integrity and impact are the three i\u2019s of cultivating purpose. How do these dots connect in your life? Where on this journey will you need moral courage to move forward? What are concrete\u00a0ways in which you can\u00a0sustain your\u00a0moral courage?
