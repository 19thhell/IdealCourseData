O&rsquo;Malia of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission will join thought leaders from throughout the financial industry to grapple with issues arising from massive amounts of digital financial data. The Department of Risk and Finance Engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly) will host Big Data Finance on Friday, May 3, 2013, on its downtown Brooklyn Campus.      While the emerging field of Big Data &ndash; which tries to make sense and use of the vast quantities of digital information that technology has wrought &ndash; is a hot topic, few fields generate as many data points as the financial industry, with each bid and stock trade, millions of times each minute. Big Data may one day predict stock pricing. But if only big institutions have the computing firepower of Big Data, they will widen their advantage over small traders, said Charles Tapiero , the NYU-Poly Topfer Distinguished Professor of Financial Engineering and Technology Management and department chair.      &ldquo;It is vital that we address the issues of Big Data now, as the technology explodes with possibilities, so that we can properly shape regulation and address moral issues such as privacy,&rdquo; Tapiero said. &ldquo;Big Data Finance will offer new information, targeting the precise needs of the financial community.&rdquo;      In his keynote address, Morgan Stanley Managing Director Kevin Atteson will outline how his institution deals with data sets on loans, housing transactions, consumer credit and more.     The eye-opening conference will also address such topics as data analytics versus financial econometrics, behavioral data finance, data security and legal protection and credit risk.   Speakers and panelists will include Irene Aldridge, Philip Maymin and Carmen Wong Ulrich of NYU-Poly; Robert Almgren, co-founder of Quantitative Brokers and fellow in the NYU Mathematics in Finance Program; Marcos Lopez de Prada, the head of quantitative trading and research at Hess Energy Trading Company; Sasha Stoikov, Financial Engineering, Cornell University; Peter Kolm, Dennis Shasha and Eric Vanden-Eijnden of the NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences; and Johan Walden of the University of California at Berkeley&rsquo;s Haas School of Business.

Launched in 2005, the MS program was initiated with the generous support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was the second program of its kind, anywhere. It is the first curriculum to be certified by the International Association of Financial Engineers that offers a graduate program either on a full-time or part-time basis. The program spans four tracks:      Corporate Finance and Financial Markets    Computational Finance    Information Technology and Algorithmic Finance    Risk Finance     The MS program provides students superior training and skills to bridge theory and practice and to engineer the future of finance by providing students with an IT base to understand and meet the challenges in today&rsquo;s cutting-edge financial services industry and its many associated professions.   In addition, the MS program provides students the opportunity to profit from a broad range of educational resources and opportunities at NYU. Furthermore, the Department seeks local and global collaborations with industry on research projects that allow students to apply their existing knowledge and acquire new insights into the ever-changing world of finance.   The MS in Financial Engineering is a well-established program with a diverse curriculum. Our faculty is comprised of leading financial and risk research, adjunct, industry, and research professors, all with extensive practical expertise, who produce world-class research while teaching both introductory and advanced courses in a small class setting.   The program prepares its graduates to enter fast-moving, highly rewarding careers spanning the many occupations prevalent in financial services and related industries. The educational program is continuously updated and adapted to the changing financial environment to augment both the relevance of its content and students&rsquo; career opportunities.   The department supports and conducts faculty and student research, seminars, and other learning activities through its Extreme Risk Initiative, the Topfer Research Chair and other research initiative the department is pursuing with external affiliates. The Department actively participates in comprehensive analysis and assessment of risks in various application areas including financial risk management, derivatives, credit risk, default models in finance, black swans and rare events finance, financial regulation, global-finance, multi-agents finance, behavioral finance and fractional finance, Digital currencies, financial analytics and big data etc. Interdisciplinary financial research relating to global warming, infrastructure and water finance sustainability, financial cyber risks, safety and security, health care, and other topics dependent on important financial considerations are pursued as well. Collaborative research and exchanges are maintained with a large number of internationally recognized professors in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
