Not only in journalism, but also in humanities and social science scholarship, it is still very common to refer to a civilization or geopolitical unit called \u201cthe Muslim World\u201d when comparable terms such as \u201cthe Christian World\u201d and \u201cthe Buddhist World\u201d do not have similar cache anymore. We rarely realize that the idea of \u201cthe Muslim World\u201d emerged in the mid-19th century, and since then, it has been utilized by various political projects and religious discourses. This lecture critically discusses the political history of the idea of Muslim solidarity from the late 18th century to the present in order to better reflect on the current competing visions of \u201cthe Muslim World.\u201d                                          Part of \"How to Write Global Histories\"                                        Speaker                              Cemil Aydin Associate Professor, Department of History ,          University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill                                                                                                               Click play to watch this program.
