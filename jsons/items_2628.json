The faculty is unsurpassed in the depth of its knowledge and engagement. The curriculum is unmatched in the strength and variety of international and related course offerings, from human rights and international humanitarian law to trade, finance and investment, from global environmental and energy law to United Nations and World Bank practice, from transnational arbitration to international legal theory.   Master\u2019s students learn from recognized global leaders in their fields, completing a part of their coursework in advanced seminars which are offered in a small group setting and are dedicated to an in-depth exploration of topics. Direct engagement with faculty is also integral to the program, as students develop their research and writing ideas, and define the direction of their future intellectual and professional development.    Students derive great benefit from being located in New York, with its proximity to the United Nations and myriad high-level visitors coming to meet with students and work with our leading faculty, including practitioners at major law firms and NGOs who are working on the cutting edge of public international law. In addition, our premier Global Faculty and Global Visitors bring, each year, fresh perspectives from around the world.   The Program   Through courses, research and practical engagement, students are encouraged to deepen their understanding of international law, of the interconnections between its different fields, and of its relationship to domestic law. Topics on which the Law School has particular curricular strength and which enable students with a specialized focus to hone their expertise while also building a strong foundation in public international law* include:     Chinese and East Asian Law   European Union Law and Regional Integration   Global Governance and Global Administrative Law   Global Public Law and Comparative Constitutional Law   History of International Law   Human Rights and International Criminal Law   International Climate, Environmental and Energy Law   International Legal Theory   International Trade   International/Transnational Litigation and Arbitration   Law and Institutions of War and Post-Conflict Reconstruction   Law and Development, Commercial and Philanthropic Financing and IFIs   United Nations and International Organizations Law   World, Regional and Bilateral Trade and Investment Law     Clinics and Practice   Students interested in more hands-on practical experience are also able to take advantage of NYU\u2019s leadership position in the field of clinical legal education. A number of year-long or semester-long clinics, in which they work with real world clients, including prominent NGOs, government agencies or international organizations on cutting-edge issues, are offered annually. Master\u2019s students interested in international law are especially drawn to our long-standing and renowned clinics on global justice and international environmental law . Simulation courses, much like clinics, but without the fieldwork component, also offer students practical training, such as the class on international arbitration and litigation . Many students receive competitive NYU post-graduation fellowships to work at institutions such as the UN International Law Commission, the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights, and the World Bank. Students benefit also form NYU\u2019s strong connections with many major NGOs and agencies worldwide.   After admission, some International Legal Studies students apply for the Transitional Justice Leadership Program . This selective program, which is pursued in conjunction with the LLM degree, guarantees enrollment in two of the main courses offered annually in this area, and the opportunity to undertake a related, academic-year internship with a New York international organization or NGO.   Colloquia and Student Research   LLMs in this program may choose from colloquia options annually that directly relate to their degree, such as the annual Hauser Colloquium in the Fall and the IILJ Colloquium in the Spring. Whether or not enrolled in these classes for credit toward the master\u2019s degree, students may attend along with members of the law faculty who together critique and debate the emerging scholarship presented weekly.    Additionally, throughout their year at the Law School, students have many options to develop their own ideas and make their own contribution to scholarly dialogue. Pursuing research that leads to a publishable paper may occur in these and other colloquia, in numerous advanced seminars, in student-edited journals, such as the Journal of International Law and Politics (JILP) , or under the direct supervision of a faculty member by completing independent research, or this program\u2019s 4-credit thesis option. LLM students may apply to join the staff of journals such as JILP, and on occasion may assist in the work of major journals or blogs edited by NYU Law faculty such as the American Journal of International Law, AJIL Unbound, or the Just Security blog. ILS students and graduates participate actively in project of the IILJ (including its current projects on governance of illicit activities, global indicators, and global private regulation) and the CHRGJ (e.g. faculty director Philip Alston is a UN Special Rapporteur and a member of the UN Commission of Inquiry into events in the Central African Republic.) The Center for Transnational Litigation, Arbitration and Commercial Law coordinates student involvement in NYU\u2019s major programs on investment law and arbitration. The Center for Business and Human Rights at NYU\u2019s adjacent Stern School of Business includes interested law students in its research and applied work.   *Students principally interested in global business and commercial arbitration might consider the LLM in International Business Regulation, Litigation and Arbitration , as an alternative to the International Legal Studies program.

In fact, there are more than 60 courses typically taught in these areas each year, and International Law is now a first-year elective. Students develop cross-cutting expertise between areas that were traditionally studied separately, such as trade and environmental law, intellectual property and human rights, and global antitrust and international labor law.   \"NYU is the premier place to study international law in the world,\" says Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez. \"With specialized expertise and courses in the history and theory of public international law, global governance, and an expanding range of human rights offerings, including various opportunities for hands-on clinics and internships in these fields, our faculty and curriculum are unsurpassed when it comes to 'public' international law subjects. Our center on arbitration and deep coverage of trade, investment, and finance demonstrate NYU's equivalent strengths in international economic law. Perhaps less well known, however, is NYU's unrivaled capacity for interdisciplinary work within and among all such topics. Our international and comparative law faculty include experts on economics, sociology, anthropology, and history, for example\u2014as is appropriate for a world where legal issues are never neatly demarcated as such.\"   The study of international law at NYU is integrally linked to the Hauser Global Law School Program , which reflects and responds to the interconnections and influences of laws and legal systems of various nations among one another. The Hauser program brings the Law School into partnership with leading law schools in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Singapore, China, and Europe, and, with the Institute for International Law and Justice , has an active series of conferences on globalization and public regulatory issues with partners in Delhi, Cape Town, Buenos Aires, S\u00e3o Paulo, Beijing, and elsewhere. The Hauser program also brings leading faculty from around the world to visit and teach at NYU, supplementing our already rich curriculum with further regional, global and comparative perspectives and topics.     Faculty at NYU study and teach international law from a wide range of perspectives:   Global Trade and Regulation   Professors Richard Stewart and Benedict Kingsbury initiated and direct the Institute for International Law and Justice\u2019s Global Administrative Law Research Project \u2014a revolutionary approach to responsibility and participation in global governance that involves scholars worldwide. Kingsbury also works on the issues of indigenous peoples, and directs the Program in the History and Theory of International Law as well as the Institute for International Law and Justice. Stewart is doing groundbreaking work on climate change and on GMOs. Together with Professor Kevin Davis, Stewart and Kingsbury launched a project in 2009 on Climate Change Financing for Development, focused on governance, design, and tax issues in global carbon markets.   Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca, a leading expert on European Union law, focuses on a wide range of topics related to EU and international law and policy, including doctrine, institutional design, and broad questions about the integration of the EU legal order with the international legal system. She teaches courses on international law, EU law, European human rights law, and a clinic on International Organizations. She is faculty director of the Hauser Global Law Program and co-director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law &amp; Justice.   Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez, who joined the NYU Law faculty after a decade at Columbia Law School, engages with regulatory issues in his cutting-edge course on international organizations, which addresses the impact that institutions (including international tribunals) have had in fields such as trade, international labor law, international civil aviation, and international health law. In addition, his seminar on law and policy of international investment addresses how bilateral and regional investment treaties, and the arbitral caselaw produced under them, regulate states.    Professor Kevin Davis, who teaches courses on international finance and law and development, considers the regulatory impact of international financial institutions, particularly through their use of indices to promote \"rule of law\" reforms. Indeed, he has led a project to consider the impact of such indices along with Professors Kingsbury and Sally Merry.   University Professor Joseph Weiler, a leading expert on EU, international law and international economic law, is currently on leave to lead the European University Institute in Florence. Professor Robert Howse, a leading WTO expert, joined the Law School\u2019s faculty in 2008, and teaches International Trade Law, International Investment Law and Arbitration, and International Financial Architecture.   International Human Rights   International human rights are the focus of several professors\u2019 teaching, research, and activism. Professor Philip Alston is the current UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, a former UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, and co-chair of the Law School\u2019s Center for Human Rights and Global Justice (CHRGJ) . He teaches the International Criminal Law Seminar, International Human Rights Law, and Economic and Social Rights. Professor Ryan Goodman is also co-chair of the CHRGJ, and is Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Professor of Law. Prior to moving to NYU, Goodman was the inaugural Rita E. Hauser Professor of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law and director of the Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School. The CHRGJ's faculty co-directors, Professors Smita Narula and Margaret Satterthwaite '99, lead the International Human Rights Clinic and conduct cutting-edge research in this area.   Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca teaches and writes in the area of European human rights.   In general, human rights issues are addressed throughout the international curriculum, including in courses devoted to international criminal law and tribunals, transitional justice, transnational civil litigation, and even economic subjects such as international investment.   International Organizations, Global Governance, and Security   The legal impact of inter-state organizations, such as those of the UN system and other forums for \"global governance\" (such as public/private partnerships), are considered in courses devoted to international organizations or the UN (by distinguished global visitors and Professor Alvarez), courses on global governance and international environmental law (as by Professors Stewart and Kingsbury), courses on finance or law and development (by Professor Kevin Davis), and courses on the European Union (by Professors Eleanor Fox and Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca). Students wishing more direct contact with some of these organizations may opt for the clinic on international organizations (led by Professors de B\u00farca and Angelina Fisher). That clinic addresses specific problems being considered by a number of international organizations and matches students with officials from those organizations working on such problems.   A number of the courses involving global governance or international organizations address the problem of \"human security\"\u2014including the risks posed by terrorism, pandemics, and climate change\u2014whether involving action by the UN, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the EU, or the World Health Organization. NYU has also been a leader in promoting an entirely new field of study, global administrative law (GAL), which considers the impact of all forms of global regulation, whether formally legally binding or not. The GAL project has generated a significant reform agenda involving collaborations with scholars from around the world, and is intended to make global regulatory efforts more accountable.    National security issues, particularly under US law, are addressed by a number of faculty members who teach and write in this area, including Professors Samuel Rascoff, Richard Pildes, Samuel Issacharoff, Stephen Schulhofer, and Burt Neuborne. Professor Rascoff, an Arabic-speaking Middle East expert who has worked at high levels of the US government, is the director of the Center on Law and Security . That center is the focal point for such issues, and regularly brings to NYU academic experts and leading practitioners in this cutting-edge field. The Institute for International Law and Justice integrates the Law School\u2019s scholarly excellence in international law into the policy activities of the UN, non-governmental organizations, law firms, and industry, organizing collective research projects with academic and policy institutions internationally, policy work, and academic and practical training initiatives conducted by faculty examining international law questions.   Private and Transactional International Law   NYU School of Law provides a rich academic environment for the study of private and transactional international law. Course offerings include Conflict of Laws, International Litigation and Arbitration, and International Commercial Arbitration. Faculty practicing in the area include Professor Andreas Lowenfeld, a preeminent expert in the field of public and private international law; Professor Linda Silberman, one of the leading scholars and practitioners in the fields of civil procedure, conflict of laws, family law (domestic and international), international litigation, and international arbitration; Professor Clayton Gillette, an expert in the international law of commercial sales and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of International Goods; and Professor Rochelle Dreyfuss, director of the Engelberg Center on Innovation Law and Policy and a leader and innovator in the field of international intellectual property.   Professor Kevin Davis directs the Institute for International Law and Justice\u2019s project on financing development, in which real commercial law development financing transactions are studied alongside public law and governance techniques. This work is integrated with Professor Frank Upham's law and development focus on East Asia, pioneering work in international tax policy for development by Professors Mitchell Kane and Lily Batchelder (on leave), and work on financial flows for climate change mitigation by Professors Richard Stewart and Richard Revesz. Professor Franco Ferrari is the director for Center for Transnational Litigation and Commercial Law. He is also a chaired professor of international law at Verona University School of Law. After serving as a member of the Italian Delegation to various sessions of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) from 1995 to 2000, he served as a legal officer at the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, International Trade Law Branch (2000-2002). Other Hauser Global Law School faculty work closely with students on arbitration moot courts and student scholarship. Leading arbitration practitioners teaching regularly at the Law School include Donald Donovan, who has argued recent cases before the International Court of Justice and the US Supreme Court. NYU's depth in commercial arbitration is matched by faculty expertise in investor-state arbitration, arising out of the nearly 3,000 investment protection agreements found throughout the world. Faculty who are teaching or writing in that expanding practice area include Professors Alvarez, Howse, Lowenfeld, and Kingsbury.   Other faculty members whose scholarship and practice often intertwine with the fields of private and transactional international law include Professor Harry First, director of the Law School\u2019s Competition, Innovation, and Information Law Program; Professor Eleanor Fox '61, an expert in the field of international antitrust; and Professor Geoffrey Miller, director of the Center for Financial Institutions.

The faculty is unsurpassed in the depth of its knowledge and engagement. The curriculum is unmatched in the strength and variety of international and related course offerings, from human rights and international humanitarian law to trade, finance and investment, from global environmental and energy law to United Nations and World Bank practice, from transnational arbitration to international legal theory.   Master\u2019s students learn from recognized global leaders in their fields, completing a part of their coursework in advanced seminars which are offered in a small group setting and are dedicated to an in-depth exploration of topics. Direct engagement with faculty is also integral to the program, as students develop their research and writing ideas, and define the direction of their future intellectual and professional development.    Students derive great benefit from being located in New York, with its proximity to the United Nations and myriad high-level visitors coming to meet with students and work with our leading faculty, including practitioners at major law firms and NGOs who are working on the cutting edge of public international law. In addition, our premier Global Faculty and Global Visitors bring, each year, fresh perspectives from around the world.   The Program   Through courses, research and practical engagement, students are encouraged to deepen their understanding of international law, of the interconnections between its different fields, and of its relationship to domestic law. Topics on which the Law School has particular curricular strength and which enable students with a specialized focus to hone their expertise while also building a strong foundation in public international law* include:     Chinese and East Asian Law   European Union Law and Regional Integration   Global Governance and Global Administrative Law   Global Public Law and Comparative Constitutional Law   History of International Law   Human Rights and International Criminal Law   International Climate, Environmental and Energy Law   International Legal Theory   International Trade   International/Transnational Litigation and Arbitration   Law and Institutions of War and Post-Conflict Reconstruction   Law and Development, Commercial and Philanthropic Financing and IFIs   United Nations and International Organizations Law   World, Regional and Bilateral Trade and Investment Law     Clinics and Practice   Students interested in more hands-on practical experience are also able to take advantage of NYU\u2019s leadership position in the field of clinical legal education. A number of year-long or semester-long clinics, in which they work with real world clients, including prominent NGOs, government agencies or international organizations on cutting-edge issues, are offered annually. Master\u2019s students interested in international law are especially drawn to our long-standing and renowned clinics on global justice and international environmental law . Simulation courses, much like clinics, but without the fieldwork component, also offer students practical training, such as the class on international arbitration and litigation . Many students receive competitive NYU post-graduation fellowships to work at institutions such as the UN International Law Commission, the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights, and the World Bank. Students benefit also form NYU\u2019s strong connections with many major NGOs and agencies worldwide.   After admission, some International Legal Studies students apply for the Transitional Justice Leadership Program . This selective program, which is pursued in conjunction with the LLM degree, guarantees enrollment in two of the main courses offered annually in this area, and the opportunity to undertake a related, academic-year internship with a New York international organization or NGO.   Colloquia and Student Research   LLMs in this program may choose from colloquia options annually that directly relate to their degree, such as the annual Hauser Colloquium in the Fall and the IILJ Colloquium in the Spring. Whether or not enrolled in these classes for credit toward the master\u2019s degree, students may attend along with members of the law faculty who together critique and debate the emerging scholarship presented weekly.    Additionally, throughout their year at the Law School, students have many options to develop their own ideas and make their own contribution to scholarly dialogue. Pursuing research that leads to a publishable paper may occur in these and other colloquia, in numerous advanced seminars, in student-edited journals, such as the Journal of International Law and Politics (JILP) , or under the direct supervision of a faculty member by completing independent research, or this program\u2019s 4-credit thesis option. LLM students may apply to join the staff of journals such as JILP, and on occasion may assist in the work of major journals or blogs edited by NYU Law faculty such as the American Journal of International Law, AJIL Unbound, or the Just Security blog. ILS students and graduates participate actively in project of the IILJ (including its current projects on governance of illicit activities, global indicators, and global private regulation) and the CHRGJ (e.g. faculty director Philip Alston is a UN Special Rapporteur and a member of the UN Commission of Inquiry into events in the Central African Republic.) The Center for Transnational Litigation, Arbitration and Commercial Law coordinates student involvement in NYU\u2019s major programs on investment law and arbitration. The Center for Business and Human Rights at NYU\u2019s adjacent Stern School of Business includes interested law students in its research and applied work.   *Students principally interested in global business and commercial arbitration might consider the LLM in International Business Regulation, Litigation and Arbitration , as an alternative to the International Legal Studies program.

A key part of this process is the annual International Student Interview Program , designed to bring students together with employers from around the globe.   The Public Interest Law Center is the focal point for public service at the Law School. Those who have an interest in pursuing positions in government, NGOs, international organizations, or other public interest employment attend the Public Interest Legal Career Fair , the largest of its kind in the nation. They may also apply to receive post-graduation funding in support of internships, clerkships and fellowships that advance their careers. This funding assists graduates to pursue short-term fellowships at prestigious international organizations such as the ICJ, the UNHCR, the IMF, World Bank, and others.

In fact, there are more than 60 courses typically taught in these areas each year, and International Law is now a first-year elective. Students develop cross-cutting expertise between areas that were traditionally studied separately, such as trade and environmental law, intellectual property and human rights, and global antitrust and international labor law.   \"NYU is the premier place to study international law in the world,\" says Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez. \"With specialized expertise and courses in the history and theory of public international law, global governance, and an expanding range of human rights offerings, including various opportunities for hands-on clinics and internships in these fields, our faculty and curriculum are unsurpassed when it comes to 'public' international law subjects. Our center on arbitration and deep coverage of trade, investment, and finance demonstrate NYU's equivalent strengths in international economic law. Perhaps less well known, however, is NYU's unrivaled capacity for interdisciplinary work within and among all such topics. Our international and comparative law faculty include experts on economics, sociology, anthropology, and history, for example\u2014as is appropriate for a world where legal issues are never neatly demarcated as such.\"   The study of international law at NYU is integrally linked to the Hauser Global Law School Program , which reflects and responds to the interconnections and influences of laws and legal systems of various nations among one another. The Hauser program brings the Law School into partnership with leading law schools in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Singapore, China, and Europe, and, with the Institute for International Law and Justice , has an active series of conferences on globalization and public regulatory issues with partners in Delhi, Cape Town, Buenos Aires, S\u00e3o Paulo, Beijing, and elsewhere. The Hauser program also brings leading faculty from around the world to visit and teach at NYU, supplementing our already rich curriculum with further regional, global and comparative perspectives and topics.     Faculty at NYU study and teach international law from a wide range of perspectives:   Global Trade and Regulation   Professors Richard Stewart and Benedict Kingsbury initiated and direct the Institute for International Law and Justice\u2019s Global Administrative Law Research Project \u2014a revolutionary approach to responsibility and participation in global governance that involves scholars worldwide. Kingsbury also works on the issues of indigenous peoples, and directs the Program in the History and Theory of International Law as well as the Institute for International Law and Justice. Stewart is doing groundbreaking work on climate change and on GMOs. Together with Professor Kevin Davis, Stewart and Kingsbury launched a project in 2009 on Climate Change Financing for Development, focused on governance, design, and tax issues in global carbon markets.   Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca, a leading expert on European Union law, focuses on a wide range of topics related to EU and international law and policy, including doctrine, institutional design, and broad questions about the integration of the EU legal order with the international legal system. She teaches courses on international law, EU law, European human rights law, and a clinic on International Organizations. She is faculty director of the Hauser Global Law Program and co-director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law &amp; Justice.   Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez, who joined the NYU Law faculty after a decade at Columbia Law School, engages with regulatory issues in his cutting-edge course on international organizations, which addresses the impact that institutions (including international tribunals) have had in fields such as trade, international labor law, international civil aviation, and international health law. In addition, his seminar on law and policy of international investment addresses how bilateral and regional investment treaties, and the arbitral caselaw produced under them, regulate states.    Professor Kevin Davis, who teaches courses on international finance and law and development, considers the regulatory impact of international financial institutions, particularly through their use of indices to promote \"rule of law\" reforms. Indeed, he has led a project to consider the impact of such indices along with Professors Kingsbury and Sally Merry.   University Professor Joseph Weiler, a leading expert on EU, international law and international economic law, is currently on leave to lead the European University Institute in Florence. Professor Robert Howse, a leading WTO expert, joined the Law School\u2019s faculty in 2008, and teaches International Trade Law, International Investment Law and Arbitration, and International Financial Architecture.   International Human Rights   International human rights are the focus of several professors\u2019 teaching, research, and activism. Professor Philip Alston is the current UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, a former UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, and co-chair of the Law School\u2019s Center for Human Rights and Global Justice (CHRGJ) . He teaches the International Criminal Law Seminar, International Human Rights Law, and Economic and Social Rights. Professor Ryan Goodman is also co-chair of the CHRGJ, and is Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Professor of Law. Prior to moving to NYU, Goodman was the inaugural Rita E. Hauser Professor of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law and director of the Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School. The CHRGJ's faculty co-directors, Professors Smita Narula and Margaret Satterthwaite '99, lead the International Human Rights Clinic and conduct cutting-edge research in this area.   Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca teaches and writes in the area of European human rights.   In general, human rights issues are addressed throughout the international curriculum, including in courses devoted to international criminal law and tribunals, transitional justice, transnational civil litigation, and even economic subjects such as international investment.   International Organizations, Global Governance, and Security   The legal impact of inter-state organizations, such as those of the UN system and other forums for \"global governance\" (such as public/private partnerships), are considered in courses devoted to international organizations or the UN (by distinguished global visitors and Professor Alvarez), courses on global governance and international environmental law (as by Professors Stewart and Kingsbury), courses on finance or law and development (by Professor Kevin Davis), and courses on the European Union (by Professors Eleanor Fox and Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca). Students wishing more direct contact with some of these organizations may opt for the clinic on international organizations (led by Professors de B\u00farca and Angelina Fisher). That clinic addresses specific problems being considered by a number of international organizations and matches students with officials from those organizations working on such problems.   A number of the courses involving global governance or international organizations address the problem of \"human security\"\u2014including the risks posed by terrorism, pandemics, and climate change\u2014whether involving action by the UN, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the EU, or the World Health Organization. NYU has also been a leader in promoting an entirely new field of study, global administrative law (GAL), which considers the impact of all forms of global regulation, whether formally legally binding or not. The GAL project has generated a significant reform agenda involving collaborations with scholars from around the world, and is intended to make global regulatory efforts more accountable.    National security issues, particularly under US law, are addressed by a number of faculty members who teach and write in this area, including Professors Samuel Rascoff, Richard Pildes, Samuel Issacharoff, Stephen Schulhofer, and Burt Neuborne. Professor Rascoff, an Arabic-speaking Middle East expert who has worked at high levels of the US government, is the director of the Center on Law and Security . That center is the focal point for such issues, and regularly brings to NYU academic experts and leading practitioners in this cutting-edge field. The Institute for International Law and Justice integrates the Law School\u2019s scholarly excellence in international law into the policy activities of the UN, non-governmental organizations, law firms, and industry, organizing collective research projects with academic and policy institutions internationally, policy work, and academic and practical training initiatives conducted by faculty examining international law questions.   Private and Transactional International Law   NYU School of Law provides a rich academic environment for the study of private and transactional international law. Course offerings include Conflict of Laws, International Litigation and Arbitration, and International Commercial Arbitration. Faculty practicing in the area include Professor Andreas Lowenfeld, a preeminent expert in the field of public and private international law; Professor Linda Silberman, one of the leading scholars and practitioners in the fields of civil procedure, conflict of laws, family law (domestic and international), international litigation, and international arbitration; Professor Clayton Gillette, an expert in the international law of commercial sales and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of International Goods; and Professor Rochelle Dreyfuss, director of the Engelberg Center on Innovation Law and Policy and a leader and innovator in the field of international intellectual property.   Professor Kevin Davis directs the Institute for International Law and Justice\u2019s project on financing development, in which real commercial law development financing transactions are studied alongside public law and governance techniques. This work is integrated with Professor Frank Upham's law and development focus on East Asia, pioneering work in international tax policy for development by Professors Mitchell Kane and Lily Batchelder (on leave), and work on financial flows for climate change mitigation by Professors Richard Stewart and Richard Revesz. Professor Franco Ferrari is the director for Center for Transnational Litigation and Commercial Law. He is also a chaired professor of international law at Verona University School of Law. After serving as a member of the Italian Delegation to various sessions of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) from 1995 to 2000, he served as a legal officer at the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, International Trade Law Branch (2000-2002). Other Hauser Global Law School faculty work closely with students on arbitration moot courts and student scholarship. Leading arbitration practitioners teaching regularly at the Law School include Donald Donovan, who has argued recent cases before the International Court of Justice and the US Supreme Court. NYU's depth in commercial arbitration is matched by faculty expertise in investor-state arbitration, arising out of the nearly 3,000 investment protection agreements found throughout the world. Faculty who are teaching or writing in that expanding practice area include Professors Alvarez, Howse, Lowenfeld, and Kingsbury.   Other faculty members whose scholarship and practice often intertwine with the fields of private and transactional international law include Professor Harry First, director of the Law School\u2019s Competition, Innovation, and Information Law Program; Professor Eleanor Fox '61, an expert in the field of international antitrust; and Professor Geoffrey Miller, director of the Center for Financial Institutions.
