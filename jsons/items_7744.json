Research topics include cell programming, cellular morphogenesis and circadian rhythms, as well as chromatin biology and epigenetics, protein translation and degradation, drug resistance and carcinogenesis. These issues are being addressed in diverse systems, including mammalian cell culture, bacteria, yeasts, social amoeba, parasitic protozoa, worms and fruit flies. Studies exploit techniques ranging from molecular genetics and biochemistry to genomics, digital imaging, mathematical and structural modeling. Researchers work in cutting-edge research facilities and share access to several core services, including the Sequencing (GenCore) Facility (high-throughput sequencing and expression analysis) and an Imaging Core (with confocal and other state-of-the-art microscopes).
