Polytechnic University: Changing the World, The First 150 Years e-Book      Here are 50-year snapshots of how our consistent mission has educated people who have changed the world and provided a training ground for accomplishments that have left indelible marks on history.   1853-1903: Enriching and Building Brooklyn   We educated the young, wealthy of Brooklyn who went on to define Brooklyn and New York City:      Seth Low, Mayor of Brooklyn, President of Columbia University and Mayor of NYC    Joshua Sill, Professor of Mathematics who became the youngest General in the Civil War     And taught the engineers who built Brooklyn:      James Wood fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge, the first suspension bridge. These same cables changed the skylines of every major city by making cable-lift elevators possible.     1904-1954: Empowering America&rsquo;s Entry into the World   A New York governor who became President, Teddy Roosevelt said &ldquo;speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.&rdquo; Polytechnic graduates supplied the &ldquo;big stick.&rdquo;      Henry Goldmark co-engineered the development of the Panama Canal lock system. The Panama Canal opened in 1914 and opened the way for global trade.    Pulitzer Prize winning writer and historian James Truslow Adams coined the phrase &ldquo;The American Dream&rdquo; in his 1931 book The Epic of America    Jasper Kane developed a method to mass produce penicillin, a medical breakthrough that saved hundreds of thousands of lives during WWII     1955-2005: Nurturing America&rsquo;s Growth in the World   Our graduates and faculty revolutionized the way the world communicates, trades, and creates, and made the digital age possible.      Paul Soros founded the engineering firm Soros Associates in 1956. The firm was involved in the engineering of ports in 90 countries.    Eugene Kleiner led a group of young scientists who helped create the semiconductor. In 1957, he cofounded Fairchild Semiconductor, which was responsible for creating the integrated-circuit industry and the world&rsquo;s high-tech capital, Silicon Valley.    Jerome Lemelson, the second most prolific inventor of the 20th century, held over 600 patents that contributed to innovations like cordless telephones, fax machines, videocassette recorders, and camcorders    Faculty member Gordon Gould was one of the inventors of the laser, and the first to coin the term     2006-2056: Being &ldquo;Around the World&rdquo;   In our 154th year we became affiliated with New York University and welcomed the dawn of a new age. As a member of NYU&rsquo;s family of schools &mdash; what it calls a &ldquo;Global Network University&rdquo; &mdash; our students and faculty have access to research partners and perspectives from around the world.      And around the world there are countless 21st century problems &mdash; from harnessing energy to cleaning cities to growing economies &mdash; for our engineers, computer scientists, technology management experts, multimedia designers, and biochemists to solve. In these 50 years, our focus is the global information economy, health and wellness, and urban systems.

Polytechnic University: Changing the World, The First 150 Years e-Book      Here are 50-year snapshots of how our consistent mission has educated people who have changed the world and provided a training ground for accomplishments that have left indelible marks on history.   1853-1903: Enriching and Building Brooklyn   We educated the young, wealthy of Brooklyn who went on to define Brooklyn and New York City:      Seth Low, Mayor of Brooklyn, President of Columbia University and Mayor of NYC    Joshua Sill, Professor of Mathematics who became the youngest General in the Civil War     And taught the engineers who built Brooklyn:      James Wood fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge, the first suspension bridge. These same cables changed the skylines of every major city by making cable-lift elevators possible.     1904-1954: Empowering America&rsquo;s Entry into the World   A New York governor who became President, Teddy Roosevelt said &ldquo;speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.&rdquo; Polytechnic graduates supplied the &ldquo;big stick.&rdquo;      Henry Goldmark co-engineered the development of the Panama Canal lock system. The Panama Canal opened in 1914 and opened the way for global trade.    Pulitzer Prize winning writer and historian James Truslow Adams coined the phrase &ldquo;The American Dream&rdquo; in his 1931 book The Epic of America    Jasper Kane developed a method to mass produce penicillin, a medical breakthrough that saved hundreds of thousands of lives during WWII     1955-2005: Nurturing America&rsquo;s Growth in the World   Our graduates and faculty revolutionized the way the world communicates, trades, and creates, and made the digital age possible.      Paul Soros founded the engineering firm Soros Associates in 1956. The firm was involved in the engineering of ports in 90 countries.    Eugene Kleiner led a group of young scientists who helped create the semiconductor. In 1957, he cofounded Fairchild Semiconductor, which was responsible for creating the integrated-circuit industry and the world&rsquo;s high-tech capital, Silicon Valley.    Jerome Lemelson, the second most prolific inventor of the 20th century, held over 600 patents that contributed to innovations like cordless telephones, fax machines, videocassette recorders, and camcorders    Faculty member Gordon Gould was one of the inventors of the laser, and the first to coin the term     2006-2056: Being &ldquo;Around the World&rdquo;   In our 154th year we became affiliated with New York University and welcomed the dawn of a new age. As a member of NYU&rsquo;s family of schools &mdash; what it calls a &ldquo;Global Network University&rdquo; &mdash; our students and faculty have access to research partners and perspectives from around the world.      And around the world there are countless 21st century problems &mdash; from harnessing energy to cleaning cities to growing economies &mdash; for our engineers, computer scientists, technology management experts, multimedia designers, and biochemists to solve. In these 50 years, our focus is the global information economy, health and wellness, and urban systems.
