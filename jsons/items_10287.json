Office hours: 3:30-5pm on Thursdays, and by appointment.   Erica Shumener (Teaching Assistant)       This course will be about what, if anything, makes a belief good (in a broad sense of \"good\"). We'll address this issue on both a general level and a more specific level. On the general level, we'll look these questions: Are all beliefs equally legitimate, or are there standards that make some better than others? What's the difference between merely believing something and knowing it, and is there anything we really know? On the more specific level, we'll look the following questions: Should you change your beliefs when you find out that well-informed people disagree with you, and if so, how? Do you know that the external world exists, and if so, do you need to be able to show you're not dreaming? Time permitting, we may also discuss self-knowledge, perceptual knowledge and radical relativism.     Prerequisites  This course requires some background in philosophy. Students must have completed at least one introductory-level course in philosophy.   Sections  All students must enroll in one of the following sections:    Thursday, 12:30-1:45   Thursday, 2-3:15       Course Materials      Knowledge , Berneker and Dretske, editors. Oxford University Press. ( K )    Contemporary Debates in Epistemology , Steup and Sosa, editors. Blackwell Press. ( CDE )    Additional material will be distributed electronically.   Both books will be available at the main NYU bookstore. Less expensive used copies are also available online. I've been told that the bookstore only received 13 copies from the publisher - so it's probably worth getting a copy online before the semester starts.     Evaluation   Biweekly Questions : At least one hour prior to each lecture, each student must send both Erica and me an email with (1) a one-sentence description of the central claim or claims from that day's readings and (2) a question about one term or statement that he or she would like explained. These will be graded Pass/Fail, and together will count for 1/4 of the final grade.    Papers : Each student will write four papers for this course, on pre-assigned topics. The papers will be of increasing length, and together will count for 1/2 of the final grade. The fourth paper may be a substantial revision and expansion of one of the earlier papers.    Final Exam : The final will be a comprehensive, multiple-choice test. It will cover the basic philosophical views of the authors we've read, along with important philosophical terminology introduced in class. A study guide will be provided well in advance of the final. The exam will count for 1/4 of the final grade.    Attendance : Regular attendance at lectures and sections is required. Regular absences will result in the reduction of up to a whole letter grade.    Extra Credit : Students will have the option of doing a short (10-15 minute) presentation in recitation section. The topic of the presentation must be approved in advance, and should complement the material covered that week in lecture.    Late work   Except in very unusual circumstances, no late work will be accepted.
