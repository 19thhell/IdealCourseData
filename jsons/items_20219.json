The     department has leading research groups in many areas, including partial     differential equations, probability and stochastic processes, geometric     analysis, metric geometry, scientific computation, mathematical biology, and     fluid dynamics. A special feature of the Institute is its highly     interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research     collaborations in areas such as materials science, visual neural science,     atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, financial     mathematics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central     role of analysis, which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied     mathematics.                                              &copy; NEW YORK UNIVERSITY"}]}]
