Sample syllabus.                                                                  JOUR-UA 9503 - Journalism and Society: Cultural Context of African Media - Staff - 4 Points                               This course will take a critical look at how the media interrelates with society by focusing on the history, content, economics and effects of the media.     The class will explore the socio-cultural and philosophical context of the media industry in general, and the practice of mass communication in Africa and Ghana in particular. This broad perspective will be examined against the background notion that the media do not function in a vacuum. Thus, students will examine how these contexts, informed by the dominant philosophies and macro-institutional practices of society, mitigate or even dictate the operations of the media. Discussions will also deal with how the mass media impact on society and affect the manner in which people experience the world around them. Sample syllabus.
