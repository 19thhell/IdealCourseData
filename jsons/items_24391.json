Goldberg Thomas Wies    The long-term goal of the formal methods group is to increase the reliability of hardware and software systems by providing tools and techniques for the analysis of these systems. In formal analysis, a mathematical model of a system is developed, which can then be used to prove properties of the system or to discover bugs in the system when the proof fails. The activities and interests of the formal methods group cover a broad spectrum, from the study of mathematical foundations in temporal and first-order logic, to the implementation of verification tools such as TLV and CVC3, to the application of these tools for proving the correctness of embedded systems and compilers.    Clark Barrett 's interests encompass both the theory and application of formal techniques. Theoretical interests include propositional and first-order logic, model and proof theory, and automated deduction. Professor Barrett is a pioneer in the emerging field of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), in which efficient propositional reasoning is combined with decision procedures for first-order theories to produce solvers that are both automatic and expressive. The flagship tool developed by the group is the SMT solver CVC3, which is used by researchers around the world.    Patrick Cousot is the founder of Abstract Interpretation, a theory of sound approximation of mathematical structures, in particular those involved in the behavior of computer systems. It allows the systematic derivation of sound methods and algorithms for approximating undecidable or highly complex problems in various areas of computer science (semantics, verification and proof, model-checking, static analysis, program transformation and optimization, typing, software steganography, etc.). Its main current application is on the safety and security of complex hardware and software computer systems.    Benjamin Goldberg works at the interface between programming languages, compilers, and verification. One of the directions of his work is to develop techniques for insuring correct compilation, that is, automatic methods for verifying that a compiler is producing executable code that is a correct translation of the source code. A related effort is the development of techniques for the automatic synthesis of correct executable code from high level requirements specifications, particularly in the area of embedded systems. Tools developed by the Translation Validation project were successfully applied to validate optimizations by widely used industrial compilers.    Thomas Wies research interests are in formal methods, verification, and programming languages. In particular, he is interested in the theory and development of tools that increase software productivity and assist software engineers in building reliable software. This includes tools for automated verification, automated error detection, and automated debugging. A central thrust of Professor Wies' research is the development of abstraction techniques for automated reasoning about complex data and control in modern software artifacts, such as heap-allocated data structures and concurrency.

Mammograms are x-rays of the breasts, and therefore deliver a small dose of radiation. See radiation risks for more information.       Screening mammograms are done for women that are having no symptoms, problems, or concerns and have never had breast cancer. This is recommended on an annual basis starting at age 40, unless the patient is high risk in which case screening may begin earlier.       Diagnostic mammograms are performed for several reasons:   If additional images are needed after screening mammogram   Patient has a new symptom or concern such as feeling a new lump   Patients who have had breast cancer   Patients that are undergoing short-term follow-up for a finding that is likely benign.       Ultrasound   Ultrasounds\u00a0 can be done for screening purposes, as part of your annual exam in addition to your mammogram if you have dense breast tissue, for problem solving purposes if an area on mammogram is in question, or if you feel a lump. Ultrasound uses sound waves to make images of the breasts, therefore no radiation is used.         Magnetic Resonance Imaging   MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a screening and diagnostic test that uses magnetic fields and pulses of radiowaves to produce images. For evaluation of the breasts, this test usually requires an intravenous injection of contrast material called gadolinium. This will allow abnormalities in the breast to become highlighted. Some patients are considered high risk and may qualify to have this test yearly for screening purposes. It is very important that this test is done between days 7-14 of your menstrual cycle because hormonal changes can alter the appearance of breasts on MRI and may lead to inaccurate results. For this test an IV will be placed for the injection of the contrast. You will be lying face down with the breast coming through an opening in the table. The test lasts approximately 45 minutes and requires you to be as still as possible.

Goldberg Thomas Wies    The long-term goal of the formal methods group is to increase the reliability of hardware and software systems by providing tools and techniques for the analysis of these systems. In formal analysis, a mathematical model of a system is developed, which can then be used to prove properties of the system or to discover bugs in the system when the proof fails. The activities and interests of the formal methods group cover a broad spectrum, from the study of mathematical foundations in temporal and first-order logic, to the implementation of verification tools such as TLV and CVC3, to the application of these tools for proving the correctness of embedded systems and compilers.    Clark Barrett 's interests encompass both the theory and application of formal techniques. Theoretical interests include propositional and first-order logic, model and proof theory, and automated deduction. Professor Barrett is a pioneer in the emerging field of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), in which efficient propositional reasoning is combined with decision procedures for first-order theories to produce solvers that are both automatic and expressive. The flagship tool developed by the group is the SMT solver CVC3, which is used by researchers around the world.    Patrick Cousot is the founder of Abstract Interpretation, a theory of sound approximation of mathematical structures, in particular those involved in the behavior of computer systems. It allows the systematic derivation of sound methods and algorithms for approximating undecidable or highly complex problems in various areas of computer science (semantics, verification and proof, model-checking, static analysis, program transformation and optimization, typing, software steganography, etc.). Its main current application is on the safety and security of complex hardware and software computer systems.    Benjamin Goldberg works at the interface between programming languages, compilers, and verification. One of the directions of his work is to develop techniques for insuring correct compilation, that is, automatic methods for verifying that a compiler is producing executable code that is a correct translation of the source code. A related effort is the development of techniques for the automatic synthesis of correct executable code from high level requirements specifications, particularly in the area of embedded systems. Tools developed by the Translation Validation project were successfully applied to validate optimizations by widely used industrial compilers.    Thomas Wies research interests are in formal methods, verification, and programming languages. In particular, he is interested in the theory and development of tools that increase software productivity and assist software engineers in building reliable software. This includes tools for automated verification, automated error detection, and automated debugging. A central thrust of Professor Wies' research is the development of abstraction techniques for automated reasoning about complex data and control in modern software artifacts, such as heap-allocated data structures and concurrency.
