LeDoux     Emotional Brain Institute;     Center for Neural Science at NYU; New York University Langone School of Medicine          Joseph LeDoux is the director EBI and is also a University Professor, Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, Professor of Neural Science and Psychology, and Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . His research is focused on the relation between emotion and memory, and his main laboratory is in the Center for Neural Science at NYU . LeDoux 's books, The Emotional Brain and Synaptic Self , have been translated into numerous languages and are used to guide researchers and clinicians in their efforts to understand and treat emotions. His work at NYU and the EBI aims to build on his past research using animal models to unlock the secrets of emotions, especially fear and anxiety.    Visit LeDoux Lab              Dr. Regina Sullivan     Emotional Brain Institute;     Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University Langone School of Medicine       Regina Sullivan is a Research Scientist at NKI and a Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . Her research is focused on the ontogeny of fear and the amygdala in infant rats, she is particularly interested in unique early life constraints on fear learning and how this strengthens pups' attachment to their mother. Her lab's current research is characterizing how the simple presence of the mother can switch olfactory fear conditioning to odor preference learning through modulation of corticosterone, the amygdala and the olfactory circuit. Her work has also demonstrated how early life emotional experiences can have lifelong consequences, and she is attempting to reverse the negative aspects of these early life experiences. Dr Sullivan's unique and exciting research program involves both animal models and human infant work.       Visit Sullivan Lab              Dr. Donald Wilson    Emotional Brain Institute;     Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University Langone School of Medicine          Donald Wilson is a Research Scientist at NKI and a Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . His research is focused on perceptual learning, sensory gating, object coding, and hedonic coding in the mammalian olfactory system. He is particularly interested in how experience can shape sensory coding resulting in changes in perceptual acuity as well as associating emotional meaning to sensory objects. The theoretical underpinnings of this approach are described in his book with Richard Stevenson &ldquo; Learning to Smell &rdquo; ( Johns Hopkins University Press ). His work explores these processes across the lifespan, from early development to dementia. His lab&rsquo;s current work includes examination of sensory cortical contributions to fear generalization, the role of sleep in consolidation of sensory memory, and the impact of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease on sensory processing.        Visit Wilson Lab                  Dr. Christopher Cain    Emotional Brain Institute;     Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University Langone School of Medicine       Christopher Cain is a Research Scientist at NKI and a Research Assistant Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . His research is focused on the neural circuits and mechanisms important for learning to effectively cope with fear. Pavlovian fear conditioning, fear extinction and instrumental avoidance conditioning are the major animal models studied in Dr. Cain&rsquo;s laboratory. He is particularly interested in how these learning processes interact during the fear recovery process. Pharmacology, electrophysiology, lesions and imaging of immediate-early genes are some of the techniques used in his laboratory. Dr. Cain&rsquo;s research goal is to discover ways to improve the treatment of human pathological fear through studies of basic learning processes in animals.            Dr. Liz Phelps    Emotional Brain Institute;    Department of Psychology at NYU          Liz Phelps is a Silver Professor of Psychology at NYU . Her research examines the cognitive neuroscience of emotion, learning and memory. Her primary focus has been to understand how human learning and memory are changed by emotion and to investigate the neural systems mediating their interactions. She has approached this topic from a number of different perspectives, with an aim of achieving a more global understanding of the complex relations between emotion and memory. As much as possible, she has tried to let the questions drive the research, not the techniques or traditional definitions of research areas. She has used a number of techniques (behavioral studies, physiological measurements, brain-lesion studies, fMRI) and has worked with a number of collaborators in other domains (social and clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists, economists, physicists). It is her belief that having focused questions and a broad approach to answering these questions has enhanced the overall quality of my research program and the cross-disciplinary relevance and appeal of her work.

AFFILILIATED RESEARCHERS      Dr. Dayu Lin    New York University Langone School of Medicine       Dayu Lin is an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . Her research focuses on social behaviors such as mating, fighting, defense, predation and parenting, which are indispensable and ubiquitous across the animal kingdom. Research in her laboratory centers on understanding the neural circuits underlying these powerful behaviors in a genetically tractable model system - mice. She is interested in investigating how the sensory information is relayed, integrated, extracted and diverged to ultimately cause the behavioral output. Various genetic engineering, tracing, functional manipulation, in vivo electrophysiological recording and computational tools are combined to dissect the neural circuits in great detail.    Visit Lin Lab            Dr. Emily Balcetis    Psychology of New York University       Emily Balcetis is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at NYU . She is interested in the conscious and nonconscious ways people fundamentally orient to the world. In particular, she focuses on how the motivations, emotions, needs, and goals people hold impact the basic ways people perceive, interpret, and ultimately react to information around them. She advocates for an interactive cognitive system where psychological states constrain the basic manner in which we perceive and react to our worlds. Her work, then, explores motivational biases in visual and social perception and the consequential effects for behavior and navigation of the social world. In doing so, her research represents an intersection among social psychology, judgment and decision-making, social cognition, and perception.       Visit Balcetis Lab               Dr. Yaacov Trope    Psychology of New York University          Yaacov Trope is a Professor of Psychology at NYU . His research interests focus on the cognitive and motivational mechanisms underlying people's judgments and decisions about themselves and others. His research on cognitive mechanisms attempts to distinguish between controllable and uncontrollable processes that produce overconfident judgments, and his research on motivational mechanisms investigates how wishes and desires influence the process of testing hypotheses about self and others. These questions are investigated in several content areas, including stereotyping, personality trait inferences, and self-evaluation.

LeDoux     Emotional Brain Institute;     Center for Neural Science at NYU; New York University Langone School of Medicine          Joseph LeDoux is the director EBI and is also a University Professor, Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, Professor of Neural Science and Psychology, and Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . His research is focused on the relation between emotion and memory, and his main laboratory is in the Center for Neural Science at NYU . LeDoux 's books, The Emotional Brain and Synaptic Self , have been translated into numerous languages and are used to guide researchers and clinicians in their efforts to understand and treat emotions. His work at NYU and the EBI aims to build on his past research using animal models to unlock the secrets of emotions, especially fear and anxiety.    Visit LeDoux Lab              Dr. Regina Sullivan     Emotional Brain Institute;     Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University Langone School of Medicine       Regina Sullivan is a Research Scientist at NKI and a Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . Her research is focused on the ontogeny of fear and the amygdala in infant rats, she is particularly interested in unique early life constraints on fear learning and how this strengthens pups' attachment to their mother. Her lab's current research is characterizing how the simple presence of the mother can switch olfactory fear conditioning to odor preference learning through modulation of corticosterone, the amygdala and the olfactory circuit. Her work has also demonstrated how early life emotional experiences can have lifelong consequences, and she is attempting to reverse the negative aspects of these early life experiences. Dr Sullivan's unique and exciting research program involves both animal models and human infant work.       Visit Sullivan Lab              Dr. Donald Wilson    Emotional Brain Institute;     Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University Langone School of Medicine          Donald Wilson is a Research Scientist at NKI and a Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . His research is focused on perceptual learning, sensory gating, object coding, and hedonic coding in the mammalian olfactory system. He is particularly interested in how experience can shape sensory coding resulting in changes in perceptual acuity as well as associating emotional meaning to sensory objects. The theoretical underpinnings of this approach are described in his book with Richard Stevenson &ldquo; Learning to Smell &rdquo; ( Johns Hopkins University Press ). His work explores these processes across the lifespan, from early development to dementia. His lab&rsquo;s current work includes examination of sensory cortical contributions to fear generalization, the role of sleep in consolidation of sensory memory, and the impact of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease on sensory processing.        Visit Wilson Lab                  Dr. Christopher Cain    Emotional Brain Institute;     Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University Langone School of Medicine       Christopher Cain is a Research Scientist at NKI and a Research Assistant Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . His research is focused on the neural circuits and mechanisms important for learning to effectively cope with fear. Pavlovian fear conditioning, fear extinction and instrumental avoidance conditioning are the major animal models studied in Dr. Cain&rsquo;s laboratory. He is particularly interested in how these learning processes interact during the fear recovery process. Pharmacology, electrophysiology, lesions and imaging of immediate-early genes are some of the techniques used in his laboratory. Dr. Cain&rsquo;s research goal is to discover ways to improve the treatment of human pathological fear through studies of basic learning processes in animals.            Dr. Liz Phelps    Emotional Brain Institute;    Department of Psychology at NYU          Liz Phelps is a Silver Professor of Psychology at NYU . Her research examines the cognitive neuroscience of emotion, learning and memory. Her primary focus has been to understand how human learning and memory are changed by emotion and to investigate the neural systems mediating their interactions. She has approached this topic from a number of different perspectives, with an aim of achieving a more global understanding of the complex relations between emotion and memory. As much as possible, she has tried to let the questions drive the research, not the techniques or traditional definitions of research areas. She has used a number of techniques (behavioral studies, physiological measurements, brain-lesion studies, fMRI) and has worked with a number of collaborators in other domains (social and clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists, economists, physicists). It is her belief that having focused questions and a broad approach to answering these questions has enhanced the overall quality of my research program and the cross-disciplinary relevance and appeal of her work.

Alberini is a Professor of Neural Science at Center for Neural Science of NYU . Her work focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie long-term memory formation, with particular emphasis on the processes of consolidation and reconsolidation. She has been awarded the Hirschl/Weil-Caulier Career Scientist Award and the NARSAD Independent Investigator Award. She is a member of the Council and current president of the Molecular and Cellular Cognition Society (MCCS). In 2009, she was awarded with the Golgi Medal, given by the Golgi Foundation in Brescia, Italy, for contributions to the field of neuroscience.           AFFILILIATED RESEARCHERS      Dr. Dayu Lin    New York University Langone School of Medicine       Dayu Lin is an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the NYU/Langone School of Medicine . Her research focuses on social behaviors such as mating, fighting, defense, predation and parenting, which are indispensable and ubiquitous across the animal kingdom. Research in her laboratory centers on understanding the neural circuits underlying these powerful behaviors in a genetically tractable model system - mice. She is interested in investigating how the sensory information is relayed, integrated, extracted and diverged to ultimately cause the behavioral output. Various genetic engineering, tracing, functional manipulation, in vivo electrophysiological recording and computational tools are combined to dissect the neural circuits in great detail.    Visit Lin Lab            Dr. Emily Balcetis    Psychology of New York University       Emily Balcetis is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at NYU . She is interested in the conscious and nonconscious ways people fundamentally orient to the world. In particular, she focuses on how the motivations, emotions, needs, and goals people hold impact the basic ways people perceive, interpret, and ultimately react to information around them. She advocates for an interactive cognitive system where psychological states constrain the basic manner in which we perceive and react to our worlds. Her work, then, explores motivational biases in visual and social perception and the consequential effects for behavior and navigation of the social world. In doing so, her research represents an intersection among social psychology, judgment and decision-making, social cognition, and perception.       Visit Balcetis Lab               Dr. Yaacov Trope    Psychology of New York University          Yaacov Trope is a Professor of Psychology at NYU . His research interests focus on the cognitive and motivational mechanisms underlying people's judgments and decisions about themselves and others. His research on cognitive mechanisms attempts to distinguish between controllable and uncontrollable processes that produce overconfident judgments, and his research on motivational mechanisms investigates how wishes and desires influence the process of testing hypotheses about self and others. These questions are investigated in several content areas, including stereotyping, personality trait inferences, and self-evaluation.
