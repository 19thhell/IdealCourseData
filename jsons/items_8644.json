Focusing  on the creation of modern building types such as the bank, state capitol,  museum, railroad station, and skyscraper, the course begins in the later 18th  century with the idealistic designs of Ledoux and Boull\u00e9e. After considering  the forms and meanings associated with neoclassicism, examines the Gothic  revival and subsequent 19th-century movements (e.g., high Victorian Gothic,  Second Empire, beaux-arts classicism) as efforts to find appropriate  expressions for diverse building forms. Students consider changes resulting  from the Industrial Revolution, including developments in technology, and the  reforms of art nouveau and secession architecture. Works of Adam, Soane,  Jefferson, Schinkel, Pugin, Richardson, and Sullivan; McKim, Mead, and White;  Mackintosh, early Frank Lloyd Wright, and others.

Age  of Revolutions, 1750-1860    ARTH-UA  411 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.    The  Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the  one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise  of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course  of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau,  celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual  expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense  emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism.  Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described  as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these  three stylistic movements, examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century  artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its  political consequences as well.          Impressionism  and After, 1860-1900    ARTH-UA  412 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.    Beginning  by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of  19th-century realism, follows the development of progressive art to the brink  of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century.  Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to  symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism,  and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem  with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.          Era  of the Avant-Gardes, 1900-1945    ARTH-UA  413 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.    After  analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, we examine its international  reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German  expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and  constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during  and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy,  cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic  impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. Then examines the  tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and  abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as  an extension and transformation of prewar trends.          Postmodern  to Contemporary Art, 1970-2014    ARTH-UA  414 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.    First  concentrates on the development of contemporary art in New York, London, and  Berlin. Discussion of the decade 1975 - 1985 will be organized around the  opposition between art as social critique and art as spiritual  expression. Discussion of 1985 - 1995 will focus on the re-emergence of  narrative, and on identity and bodily experience as organizing metaphors.   Discussion of 1995-2010 will focus on comic-book imagery, amusement park  installation, and allegorical abstraction. Then analyzes the diverse art  scenes of Russia and Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa,  the Middle East, South Asia and Australia, and China from 1989 to the  present. Examines the phenomenon of multiple modernities and considers  how \"Western\" art formats have provided vehicles for responding to diverse  experiences such as the collapse of Communism, rapid industrialization, and  ethnic and religious conflict.

Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an  early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and  Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated  in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape  paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.

Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and  cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing  forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances  surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the  problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving  evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to,  architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.
