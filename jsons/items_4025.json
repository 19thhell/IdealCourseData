Next, we will interrogate the relationship between empire and decolonization, on the one hand, and the novel genre, on the other, to ask, among others, the following questions: How role does space, particularly geography, play in both European, canonical novels and postcolonial ones? In what language do postcolonial writers choose to write, their mother tongue or the language of the former colonizer, and what are the stakes in the linguistic choice? Just to what extent is it legitimate to describe postcolonial writers as \u201cwriting back\u201d to the imperial center? What other genres do postcolonial novelists draw on? Texts by, among others: Chinua Achebe; Leila Aboulela; Bill Ashcroft; Joseph Conrad; Frantz Fanon; Naguib Mahfouz; Kwame Nkrumah; Hisham Matar; Tayeb Salih; Edward Said; Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o.        Topics in 20 th Century Literature: Transnational America Garcia Mond/Wed 3:30-4:45 COLIT\u2013UA 190.002 Beginning   with Randolph Bourne's \u201cTrans-National America\u201d (1916), this seminar  examines invocations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that re-conceptualize the U.S.  domestic scene, effectively creating new objects of analysis, at turns  smaller and larger than the nation-form. We will explore transnational,  multi-lingual and subaltern narratives that present alternative  aesthetic accounts of \u201cAmerica\u201d during different historical junctures,  including the Harlem Renaissance era, the Second World War, and the post   9/11 period. Working chronologically from the early twentieth-century  to the early twenty first, we consider transnational American  literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to  \u201cAmerica,\u201d but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and  intellectual history they reveal. Throughout, we will return to three  broad themes: literary treatments of racialization and ethnicization in  the U.S. context; the cultural politics of national belonging; and the  anti-colonial imagination nurtured by transnational intellectual  cultures. Readings include works by Claude McKay, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean   Toomer, Nella Larsen, Pietro di Donato, Richard Wright, Simone de  Beauvoir, C. L. R. James, and Joseph O\u2019Neill, among others.      Readings in Contemporary Lit Theory: Total War, Terror &amp; Critique Huber Thurs 9:30-12:15pm COLIT-UA 843.002 Terror is now a fiercely contested term, but the limits of our language and our conceptual frameworks for other forms of violence also continue to become more apparent: today it is also no longer clear what counts as war, what constitutes a combatant, and what kind of peace we might hope to make. What then can be said to confront, critique or rethink violence? We will begin the seminar by familiarizing ourselves with the origins and logics of the Just War Theory (including Aristotle, Cicero, and Augustine) and we will go on to consider the historical and philosophical contexts of Kant\u2019s call for Perpetual Peace. But the seminar will focus primarily on Critical Theory\u2019s engagement with the form and logics of modern warfare. Together we will read work from the Frankfurt School in order to begin to reckon the relationship between politics, aesthetics, and violence. Finally, with the help of contemporary theorists (including Asad, Butler, Chow, Mamdani, Mahmood, Redfield) we will turn toward questions of technology, terror, and the changing face of war in the 21st century. Can critique in anyway abate violence or the anguish of its aftermath?      Text and Ideas: Topics: Animal Humans Lezra Mon 12:30-3:15pm V29.0162 \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.         Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Outrageous Texts Ronell Tues 3:30-6:10pm COLIT-UA 843.001 This class will explore over-the-top texts by means of contemporary theoretical works of Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous and other crucial writers and philosophers. This much can be said in anticipation: readings will be slow and intense, at once fabulous and frustrating, because we no longer believe in wrapping up the meaning of inexhaustible texts or achieving transparency. If you need subtitles to understand this description, the class will provide them for you. The texts will be mostly culled from the French, German, Latin American and English canon, ranging from Rousseau's REVERIES OF A SOLITARY WALKER to Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN, Kathy Acker's version of DON QUIXOTE, and including Werner Herzog's movie MY BEST FIEND, among others.      Junior Theory Seminar: The Theory of Narrative Sanders Mon 11:00 - 1:45pm COLIT-UA 200 Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Chekhov, Conrad, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Roland Barthes, and others.      Senior Seminar in Comp Lit: Honors Thesis Vatulescu Wed 12:30-3:15pm CO-LIT UA 400 This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a Senior Honors Thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate a thesis topic, research it, write, read, and critique their own (and each other's) work-in-progress. One chapter of the thesis and a detailed outline of the remaining work is due at the end of the semester.(The thesis is due April 1st, 2012).

Next, we will interrogate the relationship between empire and decolonization, on the one hand, and the novel genre, on the other, to ask, among others, the following questions: How role does space, particularly geography, play in both European, canonical novels and postcolonial ones? In what language do postcolonial writers choose to write, their mother tongue or the language of the former colonizer, and what are the stakes in the linguistic choice? Just to what extent is it legitimate to describe postcolonial writers as \u201cwriting back\u201d to the imperial center? What other genres do postcolonial novelists draw on? Texts by, among others: Chinua Achebe; Leila Aboulela; Bill Ashcroft; Joseph Conrad; Frantz Fanon; Naguib Mahfouz; Kwame Nkrumah; Hisham Matar; Tayeb Salih; Edward Said; Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o.        Topics in 20 th Century Literature: Transnational America Garcia Mond/Wed 3:30-4:45 COLIT\u2013UA 190.002 Beginning   with Randolph Bourne's \u201cTrans-National America\u201d (1916), this seminar  examines invocations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that re-conceptualize the U.S.  domestic scene, effectively creating new objects of analysis, at turns  smaller and larger than the nation-form. We will explore transnational,  multi-lingual and subaltern narratives that present alternative  aesthetic accounts of \u201cAmerica\u201d during different historical junctures,  including the Harlem Renaissance era, the Second World War, and the post   9/11 period. Working chronologically from the early twentieth-century  to the early twenty first, we consider transnational American  literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to  \u201cAmerica,\u201d but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and  intellectual history they reveal. Throughout, we will return to three  broad themes: literary treatments of racialization and ethnicization in  the U.S. context; the cultural politics of national belonging; and the  anti-colonial imagination nurtured by transnational intellectual  cultures. Readings include works by Claude McKay, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean   Toomer, Nella Larsen, Pietro di Donato, Richard Wright, Simone de  Beauvoir, C. L. R. James, and Joseph O\u2019Neill, among others.      Readings in Contemporary Lit Theory: Total War, Terror &amp; Critique Huber Thurs 9:30-12:15pm COLIT-UA 843.002 Terror is now a fiercely contested term, but the limits of our language and our conceptual frameworks for other forms of violence also continue to become more apparent: today it is also no longer clear what counts as war, what constitutes a combatant, and what kind of peace we might hope to make. What then can be said to confront, critique or rethink violence? We will begin the seminar by familiarizing ourselves with the origins and logics of the Just War Theory (including Aristotle, Cicero, and Augustine) and we will go on to consider the historical and philosophical contexts of Kant\u2019s call for Perpetual Peace. But the seminar will focus primarily on Critical Theory\u2019s engagement with the form and logics of modern warfare. Together we will read work from the Frankfurt School in order to begin to reckon the relationship between politics, aesthetics, and violence. Finally, with the help of contemporary theorists (including Asad, Butler, Chow, Mamdani, Mahmood, Redfield) we will turn toward questions of technology, terror, and the changing face of war in the 21st century. Can critique in anyway abate violence or the anguish of its aftermath?      Text and Ideas: Topics: Animal Humans Lezra Mon 12:30-3:15pm V29.0162 \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.         Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Outrageous Texts Ronell Tues 3:30-6:10pm COLIT-UA 843.001 This class will explore over-the-top texts by means of contemporary theoretical works of Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous and other crucial writers and philosophers. This much can be said in anticipation: readings will be slow and intense, at once fabulous and frustrating, because we no longer believe in wrapping up the meaning of inexhaustible texts or achieving transparency. If you need subtitles to understand this description, the class will provide them for you. The texts will be mostly culled from the French, German, Latin American and English canon, ranging from Rousseau's REVERIES OF A SOLITARY WALKER to Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN, Kathy Acker's version of DON QUIXOTE, and including Werner Herzog's movie MY BEST FIEND, among others.      Junior Theory Seminar: The Theory of Narrative Sanders Mon 11:00 - 1:45pm COLIT-UA 200 Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Chekhov, Conrad, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Roland Barthes, and others.      Senior Seminar in Comp Lit: Honors Thesis Vatulescu Wed 12:30-3:15pm CO-LIT UA 400 This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a Senior Honors Thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate a thesis topic, research it, write, read, and critique their own (and each other's) work-in-progress. One chapter of the thesis and a detailed outline of the remaining work is due at the end of the semester.(The thesis is due April 1st, 2012). Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course.

V29.0190.001, V18.0715    A look at contemporary African Literature, film and art as a way of  examining different outcomes of postcolonial cultural policies in Africa.   The main topics include 1) a discussion of the Negritude Movement and the  artistic legacy of Leopold Sedar Senghor; 2) a close look at the Guinean Cultural Revolution and the attempts in  Marxist Socialist revolutionary art in Africa; and the Pan-African Film  Festival of Ouagadougou.      The aim of the class is to provide students with a sense of the context of artistic  productions in Africa; some of the major trends in African literature and film;  and the politics, aesthetics and reception theories of African imaginative  works.      The students will be expected to attend class regularly; read the assignments and  participate in class discussions; and write 2 reaction papers (4 to 5 pages  each), and a final paper (6 pages or more).          Intro to Comparative Literature: Promiscuous Readers, Worldly Texts    Dopico , 4 pts.   V29.0116.001    Plus Recitation:    V29.0116.002: Thurs 2:00-3:15 Hoffman-Schwartz   V29.0116.003: Thurs 3:30-4:45 Bot   V29.0116.004: Thurs 4:45-6:10 Potocki How do we learn to know the world through culture\u2013 are we ruled by a  wandering or cultivated eye, are we driven by an irresistible love for a book,  a film, a work of art? Or do we read politically, seeking the witness,  the revolutionary, the provocateur? When we read comparatively, do we turn to a  classic or best-selling novel, to the new translation of an ancient epic, to  creative non-fiction, to beat poetry, sufi song, to fado , rai , or hip-hop, do we open a graphic novel? Do we dim  the lights for a Hollywood standard or a new experimental video; do we seek  Broadway, Lincoln Center or Williamsburg performance art?      Why does the idea of comparative criticism sound alluring and daunting all at once  and what does the field have to teach us about our omnivorous cultural  appetites? What place does a universalizing discipline hold in a  politically fractured but globally marketed modern culture? This course  engages promiscuous readers and consumers of a global culture, and asks them to  consider and reconsider the priorities and judgments that they bring to their  own comparative reading. Together, we will to confront the powerful  aesthetic judgments, the critical genealogies, and the political histories,  that have shaped the ways that we think about the cultures we consume.   This rigorous introduction takes up some of the central questions and \u201ctexts\u201d (written and otherwise) that have formed  and challenged comparative literature as a study of culture. We  will consider how comparative literature was forged as an ethical and sometimes  utopian discipline and how, in the twentieth century, it became an urgent project  for writers from diverse philosophical and political backgrounds: a  cross-roads for thinkers whose nations and ideologies   were often literally at war with one another. We will examine how  comparative literature became a home-field for new critiques and political challenges that redrew the maps of culture. While we  read widely across a global cultural field, we will engage the critiques of the comparatists who engaged  these artists and writers, and, consequently, judge the effort of culture and  criticism to represent, interpret, and change the world.      Taking  up literature, film, essay, poetry, visual art, and the graphic novel, we will  consider the question of a common \u201cworldly\u201d canon, and think about how it  expands and contracts on the global marketplace. We will weigh the  aesthetic, cosmopolitan and political engagements that mark any work of  art. We will wander across genre and history, from literary monuments to  mass culture, focusing on three movements of themes, texts, and reading  strategies, taking up comparative studies of culture from the perspective of  Wanderers, Lovers and Witnesses.          Topics in 20th Cent. Lit.: Cosmopolitanism &amp;  Rural/Urban Spaces    Halim , 4 pts.   V29.0190.002, V77.0190.001 The  world, it was announced to us sometime ago, has become a \u201cglobal village.\u201d By  this we were given to understand that, thanks to internet technology and new  media, we were all now \u201cconnected\u201d and \u201cat home in the world.\u201d The idea of a  global village promised to take us beyond old notions of the \u201ccosmopolite,\u201d a  figure who used to be conceived of as a male, privileged urbanite. But to what  extent is everyone potentially a cosmopolite nowadays? Are there good and bad  candidates for that status, and if so, what are the criteria, and who gets to  decide? And what of \u201cvillage\u201d in \u201cglobal village\u201d? If  we bear in mind that a substantial portion of the world\u2019s population still  lives in relatively isolated, deprived rural areas, how would that alter our  understanding of this new cosmopolitanism, or propose other forms? In what way  does the city-bred cosmopolite\u2019s thirst for images of pastoral bliss and  idyllic rural vistas impact actual peasants living in the real countryside?  What structures or possibilities are at the disposal of rural migrants in big  urban centers to rework old patterns of belonging and forge new attachments? We  will attend to these and many other questions through discussions of  theoretical, literary and cinematic texts by Gloria Anzaldua;  John Berger; Youssef Chahine;  James Clifford; Mike Davis; Gustave Flaubert; E. M.  Forster; Amitav Ghosh;  Anthony King; Naguib Mahfouz; Catherine Miller;  Timothy Mitchell; Ashis Nandy;  Abd al-Rahman al-Sharqawi;  and Raymond Williams, among others.
