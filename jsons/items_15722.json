                                       Literature has been central to the formation of collective identities across cultures, nations, and historical epochs. Though literary works are anchored in a particular time and place, many of them are read widely in other times and other places and by cultures to which they would seem not to belong. The Literature and Creative Writing major at NYUAD is uniquely organized around problems presented by translation, adaption, and circulation. Unlike many college literary curricula that restrict majors to the study of works in a single language or from a specific national tradition, this major aims to engage students in critical conversations that cut across fields and in doing so help to rethink the very foundations of literary studies.   The Literature and Creative Writing major fosters students\u2019 skills as interpreters of literature and as analysts of culture, history, and politics. Creative writing seminars\u2014open to the entire NYUAD student body\u2014include instruction in poetry, fiction, non-fiction, literary journalism, and writing for stage and screen.   Though most course materials are written in or translated into English, they are drawn from an array of cultural traditions. Students with fluency in other languages are encouraged to read assigned texts in the original. All majors take at least one course in creative writing; In advanced coursework, students may pursue a specialization in either literary studies or creative writing, culminating in a capstone thesis or creative project.                                            Major in Literature   A major in Literature and Creative Writing prepares students for careers that require critical thinking, forceful and lucid writing, and the ability to undertake discerning research, to read deeply and creatively, and to be receptive to the perspectives of others. The major might lead to graduate school in literature but could just as readily form a strong foundation for work in journalism, publishing, international relations, law, public policy, or media.   Students pursue one of two tracks:     Literary Scholarship;     Creative Writing.

The transformation of poetic form and the emergence of modern genres, such as drama, the novel, and the short story, will be examined in relation to classical Arabic and European genres. We will also discuss the relationship between aesthetic developments and their historical, political, and intellectual contexts.

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

We will listen to a range of women&rsquo;s voices: novelists and poets, including Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Arundhati Roy; film-makers, including Shawn Slovo (&ldquo;A World Apart&rdquo;) and Haifaa al-Mansour (&ldquo;Wadjda&rdquo;); and scholars, including Martha Nussbaum (The Fragility of Goodness) and Leila Ahmed (Border Passage). Students will be asked to consider how these readings illuminate the human condition or throw light on aspects of human experience that challenge traditional assumptions, including assumptions about women and men.

AHC-AD 135 Reading the Earth: World Literature and the Environment                                                                   This course introduces students to several genres of literature&mdash;drama, the novel, poetry, and the short story&mdash;and to some fundamental categories of literary criticism including Marxism, feminism, post-colonial theory, and eco-criticism. We will be examining conceptions of nature and how &ldquo;the natural&rdquo; is represented in texts, especially after the explosive growth of industrialization in Victorian England and its subsequent global diffusion. Each unit of the course is constructed around a particular problem that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings. In an attempt to address a representative range of eco-critical dilemmas, we will examine texts from around the world not only in terms of local and regional issues, but also with an eye towards a more global perspective. In attempting to conceptualize nature and the environment, it has become difficult not to think globally. Thinking about literature is increasingly becoming a parallel kind of exercise and students will be encouraged to explore the connections between a global world of texts and the larger natural environment that both shapes and is, in turn, shaped by them.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project.

Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

Drawing upon a long history of theoretical approaches, the course considers such questions as: What is literature? What is a text? What does a literary critic or scholar do? What does it mean to read literature in translation? How does language shape meaning? How do we construct meaning from a text&mdash;and why does that meaning matter? And, crucially: What is at stake in why we ask and how we answer these questions? This class will engage these questions by reading widely, from primary theoretical and critical texts to examples from print and digital material, and by exploring particular practices of literary scholarship&mdash;from archival research to work in digital humanities&mdash;that offer necessary skills for effective critical practice.

Its programmatic energy derived from the desire to remember something that seemed to have been obliterated and forgotten in the course of the Middle Ages, i.e. pagan antiquity. Basing their European&mdash;national and transnational&mdash;identities on something much older than Christianity, scholars (poets, painters, architects, composers, and philosophers) revived and developed scientifically the Greek and Roman legacy and laid the founding stones for Enlightenment and Modernity.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

It foregrounds movement and simultaneity, blurring boundaries between &ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; worlds. Through texts emphasizing home, homelessness, migration, diaspora, transnationalism, tourism, the course examines how literature, film, games, graphic novels, and new media guide readers in this new landscape by charting new concepts of space and place, community, and global citizenship.

We will explore the ways in which authors reflect on their experience of modernity with stories that present mysterious situations, uncanny encounters, and events that defy rationality. Their texts present a discomfort with a reality that is experienced as modern and, therefore, discomforting and threatening. Particular attention will be paid to the specific national and historical setting of each text. This course functions as both an introduction to post-Enlightenment European literature and an in-depth study of the concept of modernity. We will be discussing the following texts, among others: Brothers Grimm, &ldquo;Bluebeard;&rdquo; Coleridge, &ldquo;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner;&rdquo; Hoffmann, &ldquo;The Sandman;&rdquo; Baudelaire, Flowers of Evil ; Dostoyevsky, Notes from Underground ; Stoker, Dracula ; Kafka, The Metamorphosis; and Saramago , The Stone Raft .

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

Long before print and the coming of the book, every society has told stories to tackle deep questions: about the human place in the world, the origins of natural phenomena, the meaning of love and war, the mystery of death. This form of literature has been called the work of &ldquo;reasoned imagination&rdquo; (Borges). Readings from classic works (Ovid, Apuleius, as well as the above) help inspire original writing projects and tales that draw on the participants&rsquo; own cultures.

It examines the various factors that lead a work to be canonized and the politics of inclusion and exclusion that underlie the cultural mythology of &ldquo;America.&rdquo; Topics to be considered include: colonial and creole identities; the relationship between writing and empire; encounters between Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans in the &ldquo;New World&rdquo;; the nature of the &ldquo;American Renaissance&rdquo;; the meaning of American individualism; the mythology of American exceptionalism; the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric; and the American obsession with race.

With the Art of Memory as the organizing principle, our material will include works by Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, Joseph Conrad, John Fowles, John Berger, Margaret Atwood and Andre Aciman as well as films directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Pedro Almodovar. The course combines discussion seminars and writing workshops with one-on-one conferences with the professor. Students work on honing their own narrative voices and aim to produce honors level work by the end of the semester.

Better question: Where can we go, and what can we do, as creative writers? Our course begins with the nuts and bolts &mdash; learning the tools, acquiring the skills, understanding the architecture of story telling. Then, together, we build. We&rsquo;ll also play, debate, and experiment: discovering the line between news articles and fiction; creating characters using social media conventions; writing more vividly by unlocking our senses; declaring our manifestos; understanding publishing; examining censorship; and looking over the edge into the abyss with growing confidence. For writing should never be solitary: we&rsquo;ll learn from the works of published writers; more importantly, we&rsquo;ll learn from each other&mdash;not just how to write but why we write. And we&rsquo;ll stride forward with the fictionist&rsquo;s creativity, the journalist&rsquo;s rigor, and the critic&rsquo;s understanding. Fiction, and you, will never be the same.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LITCW-AD 131J Performative Literature: Acting Epics, Romances, Ballads and Stories                                                        This course presents narrative literature as a set of springboards to performance, rather than as a series of books simply to be read privately. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach literature as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory, as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and on their language abilities. For their final project, students collaborate in staging and performing a substantial piece of traditional narrative. Works discussed and performed include epics, romances, ballads, and short tales of various kinds, drawn from world literature. In J-term 2015, students will perform from the medieval French Arthurian romance Yvain or the Knight with the Lion by Chretien de Troyes and from the Spanish epic The Song of the Cid . Short works (in a Course Packet) will be taken from the following&mdash;and will thus represent a wide range of kinds of narrative and modes of performance: ballads from Spain and India; tales from Latin ( The Scholar&rsquo;s Guide ), medieval French (various types of tales), Turkish ( The Book of Dede Korkut ), Hebrew ( Tahkemoni ), Arabic ( Kalila and Dimna , 1001 Nights ), and Urdu ( Amir Hamza ). Students will be invited to perform in the original languages wherever possible, and an attempt will be made to include works from the students&rsquo; own traditions.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LITCW-AD 133J Tales that Travel: Storytelling and Storytellers in Eurasia, 10th-16th c.                                                        Long before modern media sent stories around the world at lightning speed, good tales traveled. This course explores the travel of tales and considers the ways in which a common culture of story and storytelling can be found throughout pre-modern Europe, Middle East, South and East Asia. Drawing on stories and scholarship from many different traditions, it examines the role of storytelling in human culture, discusses the performance and circulation of stories, and reflects on examples of the types of tales that traveled--including tales of origin, of wisdom (and folly), of trickery (and truthfulness), of success (and failure), of youth and age, of love and the battle of the sexes&mdash;and many others.

Twelfth-century geographer al-Idrisi reports that eight Arabs sailed west from Lisbon to discover what lay beyond the &ldquo;Sea of Darkness&rdquo; (the Atlantic ocean), and arrived somewhere in South America. Columbus reportedly had a copy of al-Idrisi&rsquo;s book with him when he embarked on his first voyage in 1492, and he took with him Louis de Torre, a converted Moor, to act as an Arabic interpreter once the expedition reached India. Some of the earliest slave narratives were written in Arabic by literate Muslim captives from West Africa. However, large-scale Arab immigration to the Americas did not begin until the nineteenth century, and since then those immigrants and their descendants have participated in a substantial, though little known, literature in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. We will examine this tradition within the emergent paradigms of inter-American and hemispheric studies and discuss recent scholarship on the globalization of U.S. American studies and its interface with Latin American and Arabic studies. We will then read a selection of literary works by and about Arab immigrants and their descendants throughout the Americas.

Through sustained attention to formal and ideological tenets of these specific texts, we will also seek to interrogate some of the salient procedures of realism, modernism, and postcolonialism.

LITCW-AD 139 Early Modern English Drama: Staging the World                                              Doomed lovers, military conquest, imported luxury goods, political treachery, religious conversion, spectacular bodies&mdash;and pirates. These are some of the plot elements that figured stereotypes and represented transnational movement of people, objects, and stories around the globe in English Renaissance drama. This course will read English plays preoccupied with staging otherness&mdash;from the 1580s to the 1640s&mdash;in genres from city comedy to revenge tragedy to ask how these imaginative constructions draw upon the world to consider what it meant to be &ldquo;English.&rdquo; We will examine the intersection of identity and nation as these ideas are insisted upon&mdash;and fractured&mdash;in the popular imagination of the theater. We will ask: how is the self constructed in relation to the world? Which figures of the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; become particularly important to notions of English identity? How is the English body imagined, and what happens to English bodies when they venture elsewhere? Likely texts include Christopher Marlowe, Tamburlaine the Great; William Shakespeare, The Comedy of Errors ; Thomas Dekker, The Shoemaker&rsquo;s Holiday ; Ben Jonson, Volpone ; Thomas Heywood, The English Traveller ; William Rowley, The Birth of Merlin ; Robert Daborne, A Christian Turned Turk ; John Webster, The White Devil ; and Richard Brome, The Antipodes .    *Prerequite: or instructor approval.

The basic spread of subjects treated is poetry and prose narrative; but there will be a nuancing of literary genres and categories (especially of those peculiar to the Arabic tradition). Students will be introduced to main approaches to the study of this broad and deep literary tradition. Texts will include selections from: Pre-Islamic heroic poetry; Umayyad love poetry; Abbasid courtly poetry and its influence on the Andalus; libertine poetry in all its registers from the early Abbasid to the Mamluke period. Prose literature will include The Qur&#39;an; Hadith; Apocrypha of the Prophets; Picaresque Maqamahs; the Arabian Nights; and proto-novels from the 19th century.

Students will write poetry as well as learn terms for critical analysis. Some of the threads of inquiry and inspiration that will run through the workshop include: What is poetry? What does it do? What is the state of poetry now? What does it mean to write and read poems in English if it is not your home or only language? In addition to workshopping peers&rsquo; poetry, participants will learn about the chapbook tradition, make their own small books of between 15 and 25 pages, and organize readings to experiment with various performance-based approaches to poetry.

From a variety of critical theoretical discourses, our discussions focus on the theatrical practices demanded by the texts, along with the intersections and divergences of structures and topics shared by continental plays, such as blackness and race, exile, colonialism and post-colonialism, violence, gender inequality, family, moral and social values, interraciality, religion, and political resistance. The plays from North Africa that align with the Arab world will serve as a bridge to introduce noteworthy works from the African diaspora, with plays written by Africans or those of African ancestry living in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.

THEAT-AD 153 African Women Playwrights                                                        African Women Playwrights&rdquo; is a reading intensive course that focuses on the structurally and narratively diversified theatrical texts written by women from the continent in the 20th and 21st century. We&rsquo;ll critique the plays as both literature and dramatic texts intended for production. What is clearly evident in African women playwrights&rsquo; writing is its focus on women&rsquo;s agency; generational legacies; tradition, colonialism, and modernism; tribal and national identities; family relationships; intimacy and commitment; the spirit world of rituals, polytheism, and monotheism; the challenging coexistence between Christianity and Islam; the impact of the global diaspora on African identity; and the intersecting issues of blackness, Africanness, and womanhood. The course will address these various foci through the works of Andiah Kisia (Kenya), Nathalie Etoke, Werewere Liking (Cameroon), Tsitsi Dangarembga (Zimbabwe), Fatima Gallaire (Algeria), Penina Mlama, Amadina Lihamba (Tanzania), Ama Ata Aidoo, Efua Sutherland (Ghana), Osonye Tess Onwueme, Zulu Sofola, Julie Okoh (Nigeria), Sindiwe Magona, Malika Ndlovu, Gcina Mhlope (South Africa), Violet Barungi, and Deborah Asiimwe (Uganda). The foundational critical theories for the course are postcolonialism, feminism, critical race theory, and diasporic studies. We will also engage the new plays by African women that are produced at the 2nd Annual Kampala International Theatre Festival (Nov 25-29, 2015) through the assistance of award-winning Ugandan playwright, Deborah Asiimwe, who is co-director of this East African theatre festival (as well as the representative for the Sundance Institute East Africa).
