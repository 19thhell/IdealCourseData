At its core, the undergraduate Program encourages students to question the meanings of \"male\" and \"female,\" as well as of sexual norms, in both Western and non-Western societies. Courses seek to unravel the ways in which ideas about gender and sexuality shape social roles and identities, in addition to the ways in which race, class, and ethnicity function in the experience of gender and sexuality within a culture.

Our curriculum makes gender and sexuality central rather than peripheral terms of analysis and seeks to complicate what is often presented as \"natural\" or \"normal\" in traditional academic curricula.
