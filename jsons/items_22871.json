Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           This course examines the nature and extent of poverty primarily in the U.S. but with a comparative perspective (developed countries in Europe). It considers possible causes and consequences, and the antipoverty effects of existing and proposed policies.      In this course, we consider what is poverty \u2013 how do we measure it, what does it mean to be poor? Why is it so persistent, and so concentrated on particular groups? Is poverty passed on from one generation to the next? How do labor markets, family structure, and social organization come into play in shaping poverty? How successful have the array of anti poverty efforts been and which look most promising going forward?

in poverty studies through the Silver School of Social Work (SSSW); the College of Arts and Science (CAS); Tisch School of the Arts (TSOA); and The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development (Steinhardt). This minor presents the opportunity to study poverty through academic courses as well as through service learning. Students will develop a perspective on the complex problem of poverty and its consequences as it affects children, families, the elderly, homeless, victims of domestic violence, the disabled, and others both domestically and internationally. Through volunteer work performed in the SSSW service learning program, students will gain first-hand knowledge of the conditions faced by these populations and the impact of political and economic factors on the day-to-day realities of service provision.   Requirements     The 18-credit minor consists of four courses, to be selected in consultation with the program director, and a (required) 2-credit service-learning course. Specific course sequencing is not compulsory, but existing pre-requisite restrictions for electives will apply.   Students are required to take either Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare or Social Welfare Programs and Policies; Ending Poverty: Models for Social Change and Social Action; one of the listed SSSW electives and Service Learning (2 credits). Students will also take one of the listed courses at CAS, TSOA, Stern, or Steinhardt. Students may double count courses taken in pursuit of this minor to satisfy requirements for core curriculum, majors, and additional minors.
