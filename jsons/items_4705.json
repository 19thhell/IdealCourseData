HELLENIC STUDIES  HEL-UA 130    Greek Tragedy and Modern Greece      Bldg: TBA Thurs    3:30PM - 6:00PM  Liana Theodoratou    This course examines the ways in which Greek Tragedy is re-imagined within the broader context of Modern Greek culture from the early twentieth century to today. It is based on the premise that the encounter with the ancient texts enables Modern Greek writers, playwrights and directors to think through, embody, and sometimes problematise concerns about nationhood, tradition and modernity, classicism and experimentation. Greek Tragedy is approached both thematically and formally, as text and vehicle for performance. This interface between the ancients and the moderns acquires particular relevance and urgency at moments of political crisis, such as the civil war, the military dictatorship and the contemporary crisis. This course will also approach this dialogue within these specific historico-political contexts and concentrate on the modes of writing and re-writing that it has helped to shape.    The course will examine the classical play-texts and the ways they have been re-imagined not only on the stage, but also in Modern Greek poetry, fiction and film.

JOURNALISM  JOUR-UA 502   Journalism Ethics &amp; First Amendment Law   SILV Room:414 Wed    6:20PM - 8:50PM     George Freeman    This course is designed to acquaint students with the basic protections and restrictions of the law as they apply to the media, as well as the ethical problems and dilemmas journalists face. First Amendment rights and legal and ethical responsibilities and limitations will be examined and discussed. The course will look at these questions from five viewpoints: from (i) the practical view of a journalist doing his job with (ii) heavy consideration of ethical imperatives, and (iii) from a legal prospective, all the while (iv) considering the rules in a public policy context- are they fair and appropriate in our society? -- while (v) noting the historical context in which they arise. Significant court cases and fundamental legal rules as well as past ethical scandals and issues will be explored in the context of political and historical realities, and in terms of journalistic standards and practices; contemporary media law issues and ethical problems and guidelines will also be focused on. Among the basic First Amendment issues which will be examined are libel, invasion of privacy, prior restraints, newsgathering and newsgathering torts, and the reporter's privilege; some of the ethical issues to be explored include objectivity in reporting, bias and transparency, conflicts of interest, and fair dealings with subjects, sources and advertisers.

Gallatin School -Individual Studies    FIRST-UG 757   First-Year Research Seminar: Art Crimes       1WP 501 Tues/Thurs     2:00pm-3:15pm      Chinnie Ding    This is a course about ostensibly illicit, sometimes illegal, acts done to works of art, such as destruction, theft, forgery, ruinous or deceitful restoration, and unwitting conflation with divinity or living reality. To think about what we&rsquo;re not supposed to do with art is also to historicize what we now seem encouraged or permitted to do with it, like emote, collect, trade, authenticate, display, conserve, and sometimes censor, or worship after all. In examining how such practices and values coalesced, and the controversies that have attended them, we aim to better understand how artworks have challenged the boundaries among intellectual property, personal property, and cultural property&mdash;and why, long into the secular age, they are often treated not only as matter, but presence. In addition to readings drawn from art history, anthropology, philosophy, and law, course materials include forgers&rsquo; memoirs, art-heist films, and artworks that have at some point been deemed improper, whether idolatrous, pornographic, or (under Nazism) &ldquo;degenerate.&rdquo;        FIRST-UG 715   First-Year Research Seminar: The Surreal Thing   1WP 501 Mon,Wed     2.00 PM - 3.15 PM    Vydrin, Eugene    The Surrealist movement sought to transform the self and the world, each by way of the other. The world was to be remodeled in the image of the liberated psyche, alienation and repression overcome by a passionate exchange between the self and its environment. Inside and outside would continually change places as the psyche discovered its own desires written in the cipher of material things and assimilated these fragments of reality into its language of dreams. Inanimate objects would come to life, speaking the language of the self, while the self would take its place among them as a fellow thing of the world. This class will explore Surrealism as a method of interpreting the material world and a model for living in it. Students will write essays based on close readings of literary and theoretical texts and their own encounters with urban spaces, as well as a research essay. Readings may include essays by Freud, Marx, Kracauer, Balakian, Caws, Krauss, and Jameson; poetry and prose by Eluard, Breton, Cahun, C&eacute;saire, Aragon; films by Bu&ntilde;uel and Dal&iacute;, Deren, and Hitchcock.
