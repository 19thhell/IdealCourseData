The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.

on specialized clinical practice skills in engagement, assessment, treatment, and prevention with adolescents and their families. It provides in-depth, culturally competent clinical knowledge and skills in areas of practice most relevant to work with adolescents and their families seen in diverse urban practice settings (health/mental health, psychiatric, youth development, community-based agencies, schools, day/residential treatment) and/or private practice. It is designed for clinicians as well as supervisors and program directors specializing in practice with adolescents.   The program will provide a multicultural perspective inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual identity, and disability. It will also incorporate opportunities for participants to apply new theoretical knowledge and skills to their ongoing clinical practice with adolescents and families.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.

on specialized clinical practice skills in engagement, assessment, treatment, and prevention with adolescents and their families. It provides in-depth, culturally competent clinical knowledge and skills in areas of practice most relevant to work with adolescents and their families seen in diverse urban practice settings (health/mental health, psychiatric, youth development, community-based agencies, schools, day/residential treatment) and/or private practice. It is designed for clinicians as well as supervisors and program directors specializing in practice with adolescents.   The program will provide a multicultural perspective inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual identity, and disability. It will also incorporate opportunities for participants to apply new theoretical knowledge and skills to their ongoing clinical practice with adolescents and families.

on specialized clinical practice skills in engagement, assessment, treatment, and prevention with adolescents and their families. It provides in-depth, culturally competent clinical knowledge and skills in areas of practice most relevant to work with adolescents and their families seen in diverse urban practice settings (health/mental health, psychiatric, youth development, community-based agencies, schools, day/residential treatment) and/or private practice. It is designed for clinicians as well as supervisors and program directors specializing in practice with adolescents.   The program will provide a multicultural perspective inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual identity, and disability. It will also incorporate opportunities for participants to apply new theoretical knowledge and skills to their ongoing clinical practice with adolescents and families.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.

on specialized clinical practice skills in engagement, assessment, treatment, and prevention with adolescents and their families. It provides in-depth, culturally competent clinical knowledge and skills in areas of practice most relevant to work with adolescents and their families seen in diverse urban practice settings (health/mental health, psychiatric, youth development, community-based agencies, schools, day/residential treatment) and/or private practice. It is designed for clinicians as well as supervisors and program directors specializing in practice with adolescents.   The program will provide a multicultural perspective inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual identity, and disability. It will also incorporate opportunities for participants to apply new theoretical knowledge and skills to their ongoing clinical practice with adolescents and families.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.

on specialized clinical practice skills in engagement, assessment, treatment, and prevention with adolescents and their families. It provides in-depth, culturally competent clinical knowledge and skills in areas of practice most relevant to work with adolescents and their families seen in diverse urban practice settings (health/mental health, psychiatric, youth development, community-based agencies, schools, day/residential treatment) and/or private practice. It is designed for clinicians as well as supervisors and program directors specializing in practice with adolescents.   The program will provide a multicultural perspective inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual identity, and disability. It will also incorporate opportunities for participants to apply new theoretical knowledge and skills to their ongoing clinical practice with adolescents and families.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.
