About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. History of Ancient Law CLASS-UA 292 Offered periodically. 4 points.

Art and Archaeology Ancient Art at Risk: Conservation, Ethics, and Cultural Property CLASS-UA 100 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. Examines the environmental, material, social, and political forces that put ancient art at risk, including exposure to natural elements, acid rain, pollution, dam building, tourism, urban development, armed conflict, looting, theft, and the illicit trade in antiquities. Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connoisseurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials. The Parthenon and Its Reception: From Antiquity to the Present CLASS-UA 150 Identical to ARTH-UA 150. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered, as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum.

This seminar explores the history and culture of Egypt's western oases, especially of Dakhleh Oasis. In the course of this month, as we travel physically around Dakhleh and Kharga and chronologically from deep prehistory to the advent of Christianity, we address issues of insularity and connectivity with respect to the Nile Valley, as well as the relationship between humans, technology, and the natural environment. Inhabitants of the oases always enjoyed a rather precarious existence, because of the difficulty of travel, the ever-present risk of salinization, hostile desert raiders, and general remoteness; thus, we are alerted to the ways in which the realities of living on an oasis provoked identifiable and to some degree recurrent cultural dynamics. The Archaeology of Egypt's Nile Valley CLASS-UA 9356 Prerequisites: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355) and Field Work in Egypt (CLASS-UA 9357). Offered in the spring. 4 points. In this traveling seminar, students leave Dakhleh Oasis for the Nile Valley to place what they have studied into a wider cultural context. During the course of the month, students visit temples, tombs, settlements, and other sites throughout Egypt, from Aswan to Alexandria. Seminar sessions and class presentations focus on themes related especially to Egypt's ever-evolving religious and funerary beliefs, as well as the complex, often multicultural, nature of Egyptian civic life at various periods. Field Work in Egypt CLASS-UA 9357 Prerequisite: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355). Offered in the spring. 4 points. This intensive course is largely field-based, with additional time spent processing, recording, and analyzing materials at the excavation house. Students are involved in almost every aspect of the archaeological field process. Specialists offer instruction in survey techniques, in the drafting of archaeological plans, and in the interpretation of ceramics and other highly indicative artifacts. As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce original research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds.

About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. History of Ancient Law CLASS-UA 292 Offered periodically. 4 points.

Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connoisseurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials. The Parthenon and Its Reception: From Antiquity to the Present CLASS-UA 150 Identical to ARTH-UA 150. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points.

As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce original research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds. In all cases, they are encouraged to formulate and test hypotheses. Once completed, independent projects are archived in the library for the use of all other archaeologists who work at Amheida. Research undertaken while at Dakhleh is facilitated by our online database, by collections stored on site, and by the dig house library.

Students learn the essentials of ancient Greek vocabul ary, morphology, and syntax. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Greek rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 009, Intermediate Ancient Greek II: Homer , M,T,W 12:30-1:45, Stefano Rebeggiani Extensive readings from the Iliad or Odyssey. Proficiency in Homeric grammar is expected, as well as a good command of Homeric vocabulary; the course will also address scansion and metre in Homeric epic. Relevant topics ranging from the problems of oral tradition to questions of heroism. CLASS-UA 243, identical to HIST-UA 243 &amp; HEL-UA 243, Greek World:Alexander-Augustus , M&amp;W 11:00-12:15, Andrew Monson Alexander the Great\u2019s conquest of the Persian Empire brought Greeks to the edges of their known world and brought great prosperity back to Greece. The centuries of cultural efflorescence that began after Alexander\u2019s death were mixed with intense warfare, as his generals seized territory, established dynasties, and battled for dominance. While Greeks colonized the east, their interaction with non-Greeks stimulated new religious, intellectual, and social movements. Meanwhile, emerging empires on the periphery of the Greek world posed new challenges: Romans and Carthaginians in the west, Indians and Parthians in the east. The course examines these times down to the Roman unification of the Mediterranean under Augustus. CLASS-UA278, identical to HIST-UA206, History of Rome: Empire, T&amp;Th 2:00-3:15, Michael Peachin In the spring of 44 B.C.E., Julius Caesar was murdered by a group of senators disgruntled with his monarchic ways. However, Caesar's adoptive son and heir, Gaius Octavius, was quickly on the scene, and over the course of the next half-century managed to establish himself as Rome's first emperor. About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. CLASS-UA 291.001, Classics and Cognitive Theory , Thursday 3:30-6:05, Peter Meineck The course examines how cognitive science, cognitive theoretical approaches and neuroscience is being applied to the study of the ancient world. We will explore new approaches ancient material culture, performance and literature, aesthetics, language, ancient concepts of the mind and social psychology. Ideally the class will be made up of a mixture of students with a primary interest in the sciences and also those interested in the arts and humanities and the field is interdisciplinary. No specialized knowledge of the ancient world, classical languages or cognitive science is required. The class will involve guest speakers, field trips and final research presentations.  CLASS-UA 291.002, Ancient Trials: Real &amp; Imagined , M&amp;W 12:30-1:45, Benjamin Sammons This is a course on judicial trials as a feature of life in ancient Greece and Rome and as a major theme in the myth, literature and fictions of these societies. In real life, trials were highly dramatic events marking moments of crisis in which not only a defendant but often the fundamental values of society stood at jeopardy. But the trial also exercised the ancient imagination as a narrative pattern or story type that could implicate characters from every cosmic and political echelon, from gods, heroes and statesmen, to prostitutes, ruffians and assorted dregs of society. We will discuss real-life trials through the works of actual participants (e.g., Lysias, Andocides, Demosthenes, Cicero), but we will also look at the trial as a theme in mythology, literature, drama and philosophy. We will examine the interpenetration of key themes between these different spheres, especially the influence of law and jurisprudence on literature, the exploitation of literary motifs in forensic rhetoric, and the mutual influence between the courts and the dramatic stage. Authors will include Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, Ovid, Seneca, and Apuleius.  CLASS-UA 293.001, Plato , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15, Vincent Renzi Some major dialogues of Plato, with special attention to situating these works in the genre of the Socratic discourse, comparison to Xenophon and Isocrates, and the ways in which they seek to reimagine the Greek \u201cwisdom tradition.\u201d Intended both for majors and minors in Classics as well as students from other disciplines seeking an introduction to Plato. Readings in English translation. CLASS-UA 293.002, identical to HEL-UA 140, Re-imagining Greek Tragedy: Context, Influence and Performance , T 3:30-6:05, Olga Taxidou Ovid's Latin is ideal for empowering your reading skills in Latin, and his style is a good introduction to all the later tradition of writing in Latin (Imperial, Medieval, and early modern). At the same time the poem is a portal to Greek myth, and the only fictional Latin text that provides names and heroes to psychoanalisis (Narcissus) and gender studies. Reading Ovid therefore has both a futuristic and a retrospective kind of reward.\u2028The class is designed for those who want to improve their Latin while at the same time learning about ancient culture and in particular its imaginary and the sensual world of mythological fiction. CLASS-UA294.001, Violence, Crime &amp; Punishment in Ancient Rome , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15 Michael Peachin The ancient Roman world was, in many different respects, a violent one. There seems to have been a reasonably high level of interpersonal violence, often not to be remedied easily. In particular, police or police-like forces, were not at all universally present. The institution of slavery also resulted in a great deal of violence. Entertainments, both public ones and those, which were held in private, very often involved significant levels of violence. Punishments carried out by the state played a significant role here. And then, there was warfare. In this course, we will attempt to get a sense of the various areas of Roman life, which were in one way or another affected by the presence of violent behavior. Students will be required to write several papers over the course of the term, and grades will be based on these. CLASS-UA302, identical to RELST-UA 302, Introduction to the New Testament , M&amp;W 9:30-10:45, Adam Becker Introduces students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament, as well as other important early Christian documents. Students are given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament text in a lecture-hall setting where the professor provides historical context and focuses on significant issues, describes modern scholarly methodologies, and places the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion.  CLASS-UA 404, Identical to RELST-UA 404.001, Mythology , T&amp;Th 11:00-12:15 Peter Meineck This course is an examination of the meaning, form and function of Greek and Roman mythology especially its transmission via the literature, art and material culture of the ancient Mediterranean world. We explore the way in which these stories operated in Greek and Roman culture and seek to understand what they were articulating in contemporary social, political, military, economic and artistic life. Consequently, a number of ancient texts will be read in translation and set against iconographic evidence from vase paintings, sculpture and architecture. The course begins by surveying the various ways in which mythology has been catalogued and studied from the ancient mythographers to Freud, Propp. Levi-Strauss, and Burkert Then ancient texts are used to explore how myth developed throughout the classical period. These will include Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod\u2019s Work and Days and Theogony, the Homeric hymns to the gods, Greek tragedy and comedy, Virgil\u2019s Aeneid and Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses. The influence of mythology on the works of Chaucer, Shakespeare and in film will also be discussed. The class meets twice a week and students are expected to complete bi-weekly readings, contribute to in class discussion. CLASS-UA 876, Advanced Latin: Historiography , T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, David Levene We will be reading Book 4 of Tacitus' Annals, the most famous work by the man widely considered to be the greatest historian of ancient Rome. Tacitus examined with cynical insight the inner workings of the Roman Empire in its early days, especially under the tyrannical rule of the Emperor Tiberius, whose enigmatic character Tacitus devotes much of the surviving work to exploring. Book 4 recounts the turn to disaster in the second half of Tiberius' reign, as the Emperor falls under the sway of his manipulative and brutal lieutenant Sejanus. CLASS-UA 976, Advanced Greek: Hellensitic Poetry , M&amp;W 9:30-10:45, David Sider In this class we will read some well known and some less famous poems produced in the Hellenistic period (323 - 30 BC), inlcuding epigrams, hymns, and eclogues. Some of the authors to be read art Theocritus, Callimachus, and Apollonius.

In the spring of 44 B.C.E., Julius Caesar was murdered by a group of senators disgruntled with his monarchic ways. However, Caesar's adoptive son and heir, Gaius Octavius, was quickly on the scene, and over the course of the next half-century managed to establish himself as Rome's first emperor. About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. History of Ancient Law CLASS-UA 292 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the development of law and legal systems and the relationships of these to the societies that created them, starting with some ancient Near Eastern systems and working down to the Roman period. The main focus is on the fully developed system of Roman law.      Art and Archaeology Ancient Art at Risk: Conservation, Ethics, and Cultural Property CLASS-UA 100 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. Examines the environmental, material, social, and political forces that put ancient art at risk, including exposure to natural elements, acid rain, pollution, dam building, tourism, urban development, armed conflict, looting, theft, and the illicit trade in antiquities. Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connoisseurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials. The Parthenon and Its Reception: From Antiquity to the Present CLASS-UA 150 Identical to ARTH-UA 150. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered, as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum.

The website is www.amheida.org . Click on the Student Information button for more information on this program. The Oases of Egypt CLASS-UA 9355 Offered in the spring. 4 points. This seminar explores the history and culture of Egypt's western oases, especially of Dakhleh Oasis. In the course of this month, as we travel physically around Dakhleh and Kharga and chronologically from deep prehistory to the advent of Christianity, we address issues of insularity and connectivity with respect to the Nile Valley, as well as the relationship between humans, technology, and the natural environment. Inhabitants of the oases always enjoyed a rather precarious existence, because of the difficulty of travel, the ever-present risk of salinization, hostile desert raiders, and general remoteness; thus, we are alerted to the ways in which the realities of living on an oasis provoked identifiable and to some degree recurrent cultural dynamics. The Archaeology of Egypt's Nile Valley CLASS-UA 9356 Prerequisites: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355) and Field Work in Egypt (CLASS-UA 9357). Offered in the spring. 4 points. In this traveling seminar, students leave Dakhleh Oasis for the Nile Valley to place what they have studied into a wider cultural context. During the course of the month, students visit temples, tombs, settlements, and other sites throughout Egypt, from Aswan to Alexandria. Seminar sessions and class presentations focus on themes related especially to Egypt's ever-evolving religious and funerary beliefs, as well as the complex, often multicultural, nature of Egyptian civic life at various periods. Field Work in Egypt CLASS-UA 9357 Prerequisite: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355). Offered in the spring. 4 points. This intensive course is largely field-based, with additional time spent processing, recording, and analyzing materials at the excavation house. Students are involved in almost every aspect of the archaeological field process. Specialists offer instruction in survey techniques, in the drafting of archaeological plans, and in the interpretation of ceramics and other highly indicative artifacts. As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce original research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds. In all cases, they are encouraged to formulate and test hypotheses. Once completed, independent projects are archived in the library for the use of all other archaeologists who work at Amheida. Research undertaken while at Dakhleh is facilitated by our online database, by collections stored on site, and by the dig house library.

CLASS-UA 243, identical to HIST-UA 243 &amp; HEL-UA 243, Greek World:Alexander-Augustus , M&amp;W 11:00-12:15, Andrew Monson Alexander the Great\u2019s conquest of the Persian Empire brought Greeks to the edges of their known world and brought great prosperity back to Greece. The centuries of cultural efflorescence that began after Alexander\u2019s death were mixed with intense warfare, as his generals seized territory, established dynasties, and battled for dominance. While Greeks colonized the east, their interaction with non-Greeks stimulated new religious, intellectual, and social movements. Meanwhile, emerging empires on the periphery of the Greek world posed new challenges: Romans and Carthaginians in the west, Indians and Parthians in the east. The course examines these times down to the Roman unification of the Mediterranean under Augustus. CLASS-UA278, identical to HIST-UA206, History of Rome: Empire, T&amp;Th 2:00-3:15, Michael Peachin In the spring of 44 B.C.E., Julius Caesar was murdered by a group of senators disgruntled with his monarchic ways. However, Caesar's adoptive son and heir, Gaius Octavius, was quickly on the scene, and over the course of the next half-century managed to establish himself as Rome's first emperor. About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. CLASS-UA 291.001, Classics and Cognitive Theory , Thursday 3:30-6:05, Peter Meineck The course examines how cognitive science, cognitive theoretical approaches and neuroscience is being applied to the study of the ancient world. We will explore new approaches ancient material culture, performance and literature, aesthetics, language, ancient concepts of the mind and social psychology. Ideally the class will be made up of a mixture of students with a primary interest in the sciences and also those interested in the arts and humanities and the field is interdisciplinary. No specialized knowledge of the ancient world, classical languages or cognitive science is required. The class will involve guest speakers, field trips and final research presentations.  CLASS-UA 291.002, Ancient Trials: Real &amp; Imagined , M&amp;W 12:30-1:45, Benjamin Sammons This is a course on judicial trials as a feature of life in ancient Greece and Rome and as a major theme in the myth, literature and fictions of these societies. In real life, trials were highly dramatic events marking moments of crisis in which not only a defendant but often the fundamental values of society stood at jeopardy. But the trial also exercised the ancient imagination as a narrative pattern or story type that could implicate characters from every cosmic and political echelon, from gods, heroes and statesmen, to prostitutes, ruffians and assorted dregs of society. We will discuss real-life trials through the works of actual participants (e.g., Lysias, Andocides, Demosthenes, Cicero), but we will also look at the trial as a theme in mythology, literature, drama and philosophy. We will examine the interpenetration of key themes between these different spheres, especially the influence of law and jurisprudence on literature, the exploitation of literary motifs in forensic rhetoric, and the mutual influence between the courts and the dramatic stage. Authors will include Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, Ovid, Seneca, and Apuleius.  CLASS-UA 293.001, Plato , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15, Vincent Renzi Some major dialogues of Plato, with special attention to situating these works in the genre of the Socratic discourse, comparison to Xenophon and Isocrates, and the ways in which they seek to reimagine the Greek \u201cwisdom tradition.\u201d Intended both for majors and minors in Classics as well as students from other disciplines seeking an introduction to Plato. Readings in English translation. CLASS-UA 293.002, identical to HEL-UA 140, Re-imagining Greek Tragedy: Context, Influence and Performance , T 3:30-6:05, Olga Taxidou Ovid's Latin is ideal for empowering your reading skills in Latin, and his style is a good introduction to all the later tradition of writing in Latin (Imperial, Medieval, and early modern). At the same time the poem is a portal to Greek myth, and the only fictional Latin text that provides names and heroes to psychoanalisis (Narcissus) and gender studies. Reading Ovid therefore has both a futuristic and a retrospective kind of reward.\u2028The class is designed for those who want to improve their Latin while at the same time learning about ancient culture and in particular its imaginary and the sensual world of mythological fiction. CLASS-UA294.001, Violence, Crime &amp; Punishment in Ancient Rome , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15 Michael Peachin The ancient Roman world was, in many different respects, a violent one. There seems to have been a reasonably high level of interpersonal violence, often not to be remedied easily. In particular, police or police-like forces, were not at all universally present. The institution of slavery also resulted in a great deal of violence. Entertainments, both public ones and those, which were held in private, very often involved significant levels of violence. Punishments carried out by the state played a significant role here. And then, there was warfare. In this course, we will attempt to get a sense of the various areas of Roman life, which were in one way or another affected by the presence of violent behavior. Students will be required to write several papers over the course of the term, and grades will be based on these. CLASS-UA302, identical to RELST-UA 302, Introduction to the New Testament , M&amp;W 9:30-10:45, Adam Becker Introduces students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament, as well as other important early Christian documents. Students are given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament text in a lecture-hall setting where the professor provides historical context and focuses on significant issues, describes modern scholarly methodologies, and places the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion.  CLASS-UA 404, Identical to RELST-UA 404.001, Mythology , T&amp;Th 11:00-12:15 Peter Meineck This course is an examination of the meaning, form and function of Greek and Roman mythology especially its transmission via the literature, art and material culture of the ancient Mediterranean world. We explore the way in which these stories operated in Greek and Roman culture and seek to understand what they were articulating in contemporary social, political, military, economic and artistic life. Consequently, a number of ancient texts will be read in translation and set against iconographic evidence from vase paintings, sculpture and architecture. The course begins by surveying the various ways in which mythology has been catalogued and studied from the ancient mythographers to Freud, Propp. Levi-Strauss, and Burkert Then ancient texts are used to explore how myth developed throughout the classical period. These will include Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod\u2019s Work and Days and Theogony, the Homeric hymns to the gods, Greek tragedy and comedy, Virgil\u2019s Aeneid and Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses. The influence of mythology on the works of Chaucer, Shakespeare and in film will also be discussed. The class meets twice a week and students are expected to complete bi-weekly readings, contribute to in class discussion. CLASS-UA 876, Advanced Latin: Historiography , T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, David Levene We will be reading Book 4 of Tacitus' Annals, the most famous work by the man widely considered to be the greatest historian of ancient Rome. Tacitus examined with cynical insight the inner workings of the Roman Empire in its early days, especially under the tyrannical rule of the Emperor Tiberius, whose enigmatic character Tacitus devotes much of the surviving work to exploring. Book 4 recounts the turn to disaster in the second half of Tiberius' reign, as the Emperor falls under the sway of his manipulative and brutal lieutenant Sejanus. CLASS-UA 976, Advanced Greek: Hellensitic Poetry , M&amp;W 9:30-10:45, David Sider In this class we will read some well known and some less famous poems produced in the Hellenistic period (323 - 30 BC), inlcuding epigrams, hymns, and eclogues. Some of the authors to be read art Theocritus, Callimachus, and Apollonius.
