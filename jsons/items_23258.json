UN agency, an archive, museum or library, philanthropy, a publishing house or an appropriate television program) may apply to the DUGS for 2 or 4 points of course credit. Click here for the internship application .    Interns must devote a minimum of 8 hours a week for a 4 points internship (112 total hours) or 4 hours a week for a 2 credit internship (56 total hours).    Students interested in an internship for credit must write a 250-word proposal on the nature of their internship and describe why it is historically relevant. They must submit this proposal with a letter from their internship supervisor confirming the internship and stating that they will give the student a proposed grade at the end of the semester.    The student should maintain a daily log during the internship and must submit it along with an 8 \u2013 10 page paper at the end of the semester .    Internships sponsored by the History Department must be history related. Internships that consist of archival work and history research work are generally accepted as history internships. Political, anthropological, etc. internships are generally not accepted.    Independent Study (HIST-UA 997/0998)       Independent Studies may count towards the major if they are classified as HIST-UA and do not exceed a total of 8 points. They may also be used towards satisfying the field distribution requirement upon formal approval from the DUGS. Such courses, however, cannot be counted towards satisfaction of the Workshop or Advanced Seminar requirement.    Students interested in undertaking independent study on a specific or specialized topic of their choice may do so by applying to the DUGS for 2 or 4 points of course credit.

The student will indicate a general area of interest and will need to obtain the agreement of a full-time faculty supervisor. The student and faculty supervisor must consult each other on a regular basis, at least biweekly, and the grade for the course must be submitted by the supervisor to the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the last week of the term in which the student is registered.

The independent study must be approved by   the department at registration. Students are expected to spend about 3 to 6 hours   a week on assigned projects for their study. The project must be scheduled for   completion within the semester.          The student must have a research proposal approved by the Director of Undergraduate   Studies. In addition, the student is responsible for finding a faculty sponsor.           For a list of faculty and their interests, visit   the Faculty page.           Once the Independent Study is approved, you will receive an access code for the   given semester so that you can register for the course. You must have a faculty   sponsor in order to register obtain an access code from the Department. The   student should create a brief written proposal, which is to be approved by the   faculty sponsor, describing the nature of the independent study. This should   include goals to be met throughout the semester as well as a meeting schedule   or timeline.          Note: You will receive a grade for the Independent Study. Research done under the   Independent Study umbrella will not count toward the CS major and will not fulfill   any program requirements.
