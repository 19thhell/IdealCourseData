If students show up at the exam who haven't pre-registered using this specific online form, they will NOT be allowed to take the test. Advanced General Chemistry Placement Information Students planning a major in chemistry or biochemistry (and others with a a strong interest and background in the physical sciences and mathematics) are invited, if eligible, to register for Advanced General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127) instead of General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125). There is no longer a departmental placement examination. Eligibility is based on presenting three Advanced Placement (or equivalent, such as IB) scores, as follows: Prerequisites: AP Chemistry 5 or equivalent; AP Physics 4 or equivalent; AP Calculus AB 4 or equivalent; and permission of the department. Corequisite: Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Honors Calculus II (MATH-UA 222). SUMMER 2014 Eligible incoming freshmen must (after discussing with their CAS academic adviser) contact the Department of Chemistry as soon as possible with their full name, NYU N#, and a request to be enrolled in Advanced General Chemistry for fall 2014. Requests received after August 1st will be considered if space permits. For contact information, consult the department's website here . Computer Science Placement Information and Examinations Students with little or no programming knowledge who are considering a major or minor in computer science should begin with Introduction to Computer Programming (CSCI-UA 2). Students with a 4 or 5 on the AP Computer Science exam are expected to skip Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) and enroll in Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102). Students considering the major or minor who have no AP credit or previous coursework but have gained a good knowledge of programming on their own are strongly advised to take a placement examination in the Department of Computer Science for possible waiver from CSCI-UA 2 and admission to CSCI-UA 101. All students interested in taking Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) must take Introduction to Computer Programming (CSCI-UA 2) or pass the Placement Exam.
