Each represents a cultural solution that has influenced the development of Western thought and its history. Yet each is distinctive in its own way, having produced different religious systems, art styles, political and economic organizations and historical trajectories. Study of these early states reveals not only the common thread in the human condition but also the astonishing variability in human behavior and culture. We explore the prehistoric to early historic periods in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and Egypt. Working with archaeological and textual sources, we trace the unique and important transitions from a life as hunters and gatherers to settling down in villages and the development of cities and states, and gain a deep appreciation for the accomplishments of the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians and some sense of our own place in the larger scheme of world history.   FALL 2011 MAP-UA 502 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Chelkowski (MEIS) syllabus Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or as historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200 years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978\u201379 Islamic Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority\u2014some 60%\u2014of the population, but historically they have been deprived of power in the government and of access to the political and economic life of the country. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew and Judaic Studies) syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 534 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Prof. Ralph (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Introduces students to the study of the African continent and the disparate peoples and societies that can be located within a shared historical trajectory. In the process, we will explore the way that different scholars have defined Africa\u2019s historical relationship to the Atlantic World, how they have conceived of what has come to be known as \u201cThe Black Atlantic,\u201d and the ways they have worked to critique and enrich this formulation. This means exploring key events of the modern period\u2014the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions, the Enlightenment, the Transatlantic slave trade, the birth of capitalism, and the formation of international systems for diplomacy and economic exchange\u2014and examining how race, gender, economic standing, social status, generation and ability shape economic and political aspirations and emotional attachments. As a case study, we focus critical attention on the city of New Orleans\u2014first as an early modern commercial shipping center, then as a slave entrep\u00f4t, and finally as a colony of France and then Spain, and finally as a US city\u2014and consider what it means to view New Orleans, and Louisiana more broadly, as part of the African Diaspora. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 536 Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology) syllabus The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 538 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Diaspora Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (History/Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) syllabus Muslim minorities have emerged as a \u201cproblem\u201d and a \u201cchallenge.\u201d However, little is known how they formed and what are their experiences. We explore two such communities whose histories are very different\u2014the Muslims in China and Europe\u2014and get a taste also of their art and music. We also look at some of the many Muslim communities outside of the \"Islamic heartlands,\" that is, beyond what is referred to in Islamic tradition as the \u201cHouse/realm of Islam.\u201d In some cases these \"diaspora\" communities are of considerable vintage: China, for example, has been home to Muslims since the time of the prophet Muhammad. Others are more recent, including those in the Americas and Europe. Islamic diasporas are the result of multiple processes, including trade, migration (forced and voluntary), and missionizing activities, as well as military and political expansion. Islamic culture, gender relations, connections to slavery and concepts of race, theories of government, social movements, scholarship and education, and systems of trade are also analyzed. In the process of examining these issues, certain questions confront us along the way: How real is the distinction between dar al-Islam and dar al-Harb (\u201cHouse of Islam\u201d and \u201cHouse/realm of War\u201d)? How does it affect the perception different Muslim groups have of one another? What is the relationship between pan-Islamic movements and Islamic diasporas/diasporicity? FALL 2011 MAP-UA 539 Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Tu (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis) syllabus Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization, among others. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. As an expression/reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts, we pay particular attention to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions--films, literature, art, media, and popular culture. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Ben-Dor Benite ( History/Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies ) syllabus We discover the ways in which people \u201cdiscovered\u201d the world during the 15th and 16th centuries and ask what gave that period the title: \u201cThe Age of Discovery.\u201d We ask why do people \u201cexplore.\u201d We investigate the ways in which people have created, traveled to, encountered, and reported on \u201cnew-worlds.\u201d We read the accounts of sailors, pirates, merchants, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. We discuss the themes of history, religion, geography, and imagination and see how they shaped the ways in which people encountered new worlds. We ask how \u201cfrontiers\u201d are created and we focus on issues such as: distances and altitudes, culture, modes of travel, food, sex, music, and many others. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese) syllabus What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 543 Cultures and Contexts: Korea Prof. Em (East Asian Studies) syllabus From the late 19th century until today, it can be argued that politically engaged writers in Korea have been preoccupied with two interrelated issues: the national question, as the struggle for national sovereignty during the colonial period (1910-1945), and the dream of reunification following national partition in 1945 and the Korean War (1950-1953); and democracy, as the struggle against authoritarian governments, but also authoritarianism in schools, family, and the workplace, and the struggle to restructure policies, institutions, and practices that render certain groups of people (women, workers, the urban poor, sexual minorities, migrant workers, people with disabilities) unworthy of respect or esteem. We look at how students, workers, and intellectuals write about and mobilized around issues of nation and democracy, issues they saw as structurally linked. We also locate these issues within a broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs  Prof. Morris (Institute for the Study of the Ancient World) syllabus The archaeology, literature, and art of ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity. Settlements that are particularly well documented through both archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal). Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing, attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the construction of well crafted satire. Primary sources include letters, wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, physical anthropology. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 546 Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History) syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 550 Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the Americas Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus The idea of \u201cAmerica\u201d has long been dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists, policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \u201cOld World\u201d tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events (e.g., 19th-20th century migrations of Asians to Central America) and explore how global visions and international movements as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism, cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/creolite emerge from local currents and practices.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 551 Cultures and Contexts: Immigrant America in the 19th Century Prof. Diner (History) syllabus The \u201clong nineteenth century,\u201d from the 1820s through the 1920s saw the arrival of no fewer than 50 million immigrants to the United States. Coming primarily, although not exclusively, from Europe, their migrations not only transformed the places they left, but profoundly altered American society. These migrations, all of which involved a high degree of choice on the part of their participants, took place within the context of family and communal decision making, which in turn impacted significantly on the women and men who made these journeys, allowing\u2014or forcing\u2014them to create new kinds of identities, institutions, and cultures. They indeed, as a result of their migrations, became new people. They became \u201cethnic,\u201d as they had to redefine themselves both in terms of what they left, what they \u201cbrought\u201d with them, and what they encountered in America. We explore how their journeys lead to the creation of a set of ethnic communities in America, which we can see as specific and unique and yet resembling each other in notable ways, focusing on three seemingly very different nineteenth century groups: Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants and the ethnic cultures they created.      SPRING 2012 MAP-UA  500  Cultures and Contexts: Topics \u2014 Rome Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus Italian culture seen through the lens of its most emblematic site and subject: Rome ancient and modern, mythical and historical, visual and verbal. Epitomizing the very notion of cultural perpetuity, Rome--in its artifacts and images, its politics and its myths, its models of democracy and empire--lurks at the heart of Italian identity. We examine the Eternal City in its aesthetic and historical specificity--its importance as an actual place--and also as an idea and an ideal, put to various political and cultural ends in the formation of Italians' visions of themselves. We thus consider the enduring and shifting significance of Rome for Italian self-understanding: beginning with the founding and development of the city, through its various \"rebirths\" in the Renaissance, the Italian Risorgimento, and the Fascist Regime, and also briefly consider the vitality of Rome and its histories/myths to other national traditions, political movements, and aesthetic programs, from France to the United States.     SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 502 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. el-Leithy (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Societies) syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 502 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies  Prof. Rowson  (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Societies) syllabus The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 507 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Japan Prof. Looser (East Asian Studies) Japanese national identity is the product of a diversity of cultures and communities. Starting with a broad historical overview of this diversity, critical focus is given to those categories commonly used to describe a single coherent \"Japanese\" culture. These include the categories of nation (e.g., Japan as an economic state, Japan as a nation defined by beauty and aesthetics), modernity (e.g., gender, family, ethnicity, new religions), and popular culture (e.g., mass culture, subcultures).  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 508 Cultures and Contexts: The Pacific Islands Prof. Geismar (Anthropology and Museum Studies) syllabus The Pacific Island region sweeps from Easter Island in the East to Papua New Guinea in the West, a vast \u201csea of islands\u201d that has been a crucial space of exchange: of perspectives, materials, people and ideas. What can we learn from the study of this region, a set of islands with both commonalities and differences that is often imagined as one \u201cplace\u201d? We examine the cultures of the Pacific Islands, moving from the first migrations of indigenous navigators through the age of European exploration and colonialism, to the local experience of World War II and contemporary engagements with globalization. We also study the area\u2019s unique cultural configurations of ritual practice, cosmology, and society. Along the way, we engage directly with the voices of Pacific islanders, from those who participated in the voyages of Captain Cook, to indigenous artists who reflect on these complex and entangled histories. Other primary sources include museum collections, film, painting, and other visual representations. This comparative approach enables us to understand debates about colonial encounter, primitivism, cannibalism, cargo cults, nuclear testing, resource extraction, and the morality of diet, from a Pacific perspective.   SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Smith (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 b.c.e. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century b.c.e. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 529 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr \u00e1 n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis) syllabus Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and political life of these communities. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 544  Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain  Prof. Mendelson (Spanish and Portuguese) syllabus  What does Spanish culture look like? What are the different materials that Spanish artists and writers have chosen to articulate the often complex understandings they have of themselves, their nation(s), their relation to modernity (its opportunities and challenges), and the broader international community? We approach Spanish culture critically by learning about specific works and the contexts within which they exist, focusing on the mid-nineteenth century through the late-twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, film (fiction and documentary), painting, poster art, photography, performance, and architecture. Students actively engage in an informed analysis of cultural works from Spain in order to better understand and question the relation between cultural forms and questions of national identity, tradition, modernity, and authorship as they relate to the historical moment and location in which they are produced.   SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew and Judaic Studies) syllabus The development of ancient Egyptian civilization, the basic tenets of its religious beliefs, its social forms and organizations, the conventions and achievements of its literature, art, and architecture. Students learn how scholars have used the remains of this long-vanished culture to reconstruct it and how to employ these methods to analyze texts and artifacts themselves. Materials include a variety of primary sources (literature, architecture, religious writings, works of art, archaeological remains, and administrative documents), and critical evaluation of the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 552 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) &amp; Prof. Cooper (History) syllabus Comparative   study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that   empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights,   belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long   in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom    they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained   social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different   people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political    organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take   account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher   degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority,   sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of   empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that   the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires   were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that   focus on political and economic connections over long distances and   long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the   topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations.   Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol,   Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as   primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial   polities.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA  553  Cultures and Contexts: Pagan Europe Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History) syllabus In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge.         SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 555 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History) syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.    top of page                 Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Cultures & Contexts    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       Cultures & Contexts | 2014-2015 Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus Fall 2014 FALL 2014 CORE-UA 500, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Topics\u2014The Silk Road and Central Asia Prof. Stark (Institute for the Study of the Ancient World)  syllabus For centuries Central Asia has been a conduit for a variety of cultural encounters and transfers between China, India, the Near East and the Mediterranean. In an almost emblematic way, this position and function seems to be embodied in our image of the far-distant caravan trader, traversing on the so-called \u201cSilk roads\u201d the vast expanses between China and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. However, it was not only traders that connected the civilizations of the ancient world via Central Asia: with and next to the traders\u2019 caravans traveled diplomats, missionaries, artists and many more; and vast parts of Eurasia were, again and again, connected and controlled by confederations and empires of nomadic origin. We inquire into the many facets, which characterize the resulting network, oscillating around Central Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the Mongol Empire, taking a multi-disciplinary approach to a considerable variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus The South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality, and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television, internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (History)  syllabus Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 512, Cultures &amp; Contexts: China Prof. Zhang (East Asian Studies)  syllabus  An introduction to the main issues and foundational texts of imperial and modern China. Selected readings include excerpts from early Chinese classics such as Classic of Odes and the Analects to the vernacular novels of late imperial China. The classical canon is then coupled with central texts from modern China, from the initial reflections of the mandarin scholars on a rapidly changing world, to writings on revolution, the modern state, and the new culture of the enlightened individual by leading Chinese intellectuals in the 20th century. Rather than a display of cultural and literary edifices, our intellectual and critical interest is to rethink Chinese traditions, both imperial and modern, in terms of continuity as well as discontinuity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus  Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: African Diaspora Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to non-African influences. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 536, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology)  syllabus  The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Saranillio (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Examines significant historical and contemporary moments through an analysis of culture and power and how cultural productions--film, television dramas, novels, visual art, national monuments and memorials, among others--produce ideas, stories and silences in different historical moments about different Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have contemporary resonance today. For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 540, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Mongol Asia and Its Legacy Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to the outskirts of Central Europe. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. We examine the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective emphasizing the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Themes include nomadic life and culture, the structure of a nomadic empire, how that nomadic empire interacted with the various settled states it conquered, and ramifications of the Mongol conquest on economy and trade, medicine, science and technology, food and art, culture and religion, as well as social and intellectual developments across Eurasia, during the time period from approximately 1200 to 1450 C.E. Our primary sources will be narratives of Mongols generals, stories of peoples they conquered, and travelogues of people who travelled in Mongol territories, and we also look at visual depictions of the Mongols in art and cinema, pay special attention to the environment and how it shaped the life of the Mongols, dedicate time to the image of Genghis Khan, the role played by women, both from the commoner society and from the elite, and interactions with Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, and Islam. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus  Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 552, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and the Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) and Prof. Cooper (History)  syllabus  Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 555, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History)  syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus  The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 505, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 507, Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Kaffen (East Asian Studies)  syllabus Japan from 1945 to the present, through cinema, animation, photography, manga, television, kami shibai, pop songs, and other creative forms of expression and documentation, with emphasis on various points of view both within Japan (women, youth, burakumin, Okinawan), and externally (the US-Japan relationship, Japan\u2019s relationship with its East- Asian neighbors). We consider the ways Japan is framed and imagined, as well as the tensions, contradictions, and variety of perspectives at work in those imaginations; the processes of mediation through which history and place are constructed; and issues such as war responsibility, high economic growth, political radicalism, technology and consumption, and \u201clost decades,\u201d and what they might mean for a consideration of Japan\u2019s place in the world at present. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus  Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus  Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 541, Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Tortorici (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus  What was America before it was called \u201cAmerica\u201d? How did indigenous peoples understand and document their first encounters with Europeans and Africans? We focus on how the convergence of indigenous, African, European, and Asian peoples in the Americas created complex cultures, societies, ethnicities, and forms of religiosity. Beginning with the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the \u201cIndies\u201d by Christopher Columbus in 1492, we work our way thematically and chronologically through the centuries of conquest and colonial rule, up until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. We also examine the historical context before 1492 in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East (with an emphasis on how particular Old World encounters affected New World encounters). SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History)  syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 553, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Pagan Europe, 60\u20131600 C.E. Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History)  syllabus  In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus  The culture of modern Italy\u2014a nation younger than the United States, yet steeped in all manner of millennial traditions, linguistic dialects, and regional artistic and economic customs. \u201cWe have made Italy; we must now make Italians.\u201d Thus declared the politician and writer Massimo d\u2019Azeglio following the country\u2019s belated unification in 1861. How has Italy attempted to \u201cmake Italians\u201d over the last century? What forms of culture could unify a people so diverse in origins and aspirations? Has the country managed to transform itself from a \u201cgeographic idea\u201d to a cultural reality? Aside from commonplaces\u2014rolling hills, historical landmarks, beloved cuisine, fashion runways\u2014what are the bel paese\u2019s most salient cultural characteristics, and why do they matter? We examine cultural manifestations in various visual, verbal, and material forms: manifestos, cinema, literature, popular music, poetry, architecture, painting, television, exhibitions, and journalism.

Each represents a cultural solution that has influenced the development of Western thought and its history. Yet each is distinctive in its own way, having produced different religious systems, art styles, political and economic organizations and historical trajectories. Study of these early states reveals not only the common thread in the human condition but also the astonishing variability in human behavior and culture. We explore the prehistoric to early historic periods in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and Egypt. Working with archaeological and textual sources, we trace the unique and important transitions from a life as hunters and gatherers to settling down in villages and the development of cities and states, and gain a deep appreciation for the accomplishments of the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians and some sense of our own place in the larger scheme of world history.   FALL 2011 MAP-UA 502 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Chelkowski (MEIS) syllabus Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or as historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200 years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978\u201379 Islamic Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority\u2014some 60%\u2014of the population, but historically they have been deprived of power in the government and of access to the political and economic life of the country. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew and Judaic Studies) syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 534 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Prof. Ralph (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Introduces students to the study of the African continent and the disparate peoples and societies that can be located within a shared historical trajectory. In the process, we will explore the way that different scholars have defined Africa\u2019s historical relationship to the Atlantic World, how they have conceived of what has come to be known as \u201cThe Black Atlantic,\u201d and the ways they have worked to critique and enrich this formulation. This means exploring key events of the modern period\u2014the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions, the Enlightenment, the Transatlantic slave trade, the birth of capitalism, and the formation of international systems for diplomacy and economic exchange\u2014and examining how race, gender, economic standing, social status, generation and ability shape economic and political aspirations and emotional attachments. As a case study, we focus critical attention on the city of New Orleans\u2014first as an early modern commercial shipping center, then as a slave entrep\u00f4t, and finally as a colony of France and then Spain, and finally as a US city\u2014and consider what it means to view New Orleans, and Louisiana more broadly, as part of the African Diaspora. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 536 Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology) syllabus The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 538 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Diaspora Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (History/Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) syllabus Muslim minorities have emerged as a \u201cproblem\u201d and a \u201cchallenge.\u201d However, little is known how they formed and what are their experiences. We explore two such communities whose histories are very different\u2014the Muslims in China and Europe\u2014and get a taste also of their art and music. We also look at some of the many Muslim communities outside of the \"Islamic heartlands,\" that is, beyond what is referred to in Islamic tradition as the \u201cHouse/realm of Islam.\u201d In some cases these \"diaspora\" communities are of considerable vintage: China, for example, has been home to Muslims since the time of the prophet Muhammad. Others are more recent, including those in the Americas and Europe. Islamic diasporas are the result of multiple processes, including trade, migration (forced and voluntary), and missionizing activities, as well as military and political expansion. Islamic culture, gender relations, connections to slavery and concepts of race, theories of government, social movements, scholarship and education, and systems of trade are also analyzed. In the process of examining these issues, certain questions confront us along the way: How real is the distinction between dar al-Islam and dar al-Harb (\u201cHouse of Islam\u201d and \u201cHouse/realm of War\u201d)? How does it affect the perception different Muslim groups have of one another? What is the relationship between pan-Islamic movements and Islamic diasporas/diasporicity? FALL 2011 MAP-UA 539 Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Tu (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis) syllabus Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization, among others. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. As an expression/reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts, we pay particular attention to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions--films, literature, art, media, and popular culture. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Ben-Dor Benite ( History/Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies ) syllabus We discover the ways in which people \u201cdiscovered\u201d the world during the 15th and 16th centuries and ask what gave that period the title: \u201cThe Age of Discovery.\u201d We ask why do people \u201cexplore.\u201d We investigate the ways in which people have created, traveled to, encountered, and reported on \u201cnew-worlds.\u201d We read the accounts of sailors, pirates, merchants, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. We discuss the themes of history, religion, geography, and imagination and see how they shaped the ways in which people encountered new worlds. We ask how \u201cfrontiers\u201d are created and we focus on issues such as: distances and altitudes, culture, modes of travel, food, sex, music, and many others. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese) syllabus What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 543 Cultures and Contexts: Korea Prof. Em (East Asian Studies) syllabus From the late 19th century until today, it can be argued that politically engaged writers in Korea have been preoccupied with two interrelated issues: the national question, as the struggle for national sovereignty during the colonial period (1910-1945), and the dream of reunification following national partition in 1945 and the Korean War (1950-1953); and democracy, as the struggle against authoritarian governments, but also authoritarianism in schools, family, and the workplace, and the struggle to restructure policies, institutions, and practices that render certain groups of people (women, workers, the urban poor, sexual minorities, migrant workers, people with disabilities) unworthy of respect or esteem. We look at how students, workers, and intellectuals write about and mobilized around issues of nation and democracy, issues they saw as structurally linked. We also locate these issues within a broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs  Prof. Morris (Institute for the Study of the Ancient World) syllabus The archaeology, literature, and art of ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity. Settlements that are particularly well documented through both archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal). Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing, attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the construction of well crafted satire. Primary sources include letters, wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, physical anthropology. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 546 Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History) syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 550 Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the Americas Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus The idea of \u201cAmerica\u201d has long been dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists, policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \u201cOld World\u201d tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events (e.g., 19th-20th century migrations of Asians to Central America) and explore how global visions and international movements as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism, cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/creolite emerge from local currents and practices.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 551 Cultures and Contexts: Immigrant America in the 19th Century Prof. Diner (History) syllabus The \u201clong nineteenth century,\u201d from the 1820s through the 1920s saw the arrival of no fewer than 50 million immigrants to the United States. Coming primarily, although not exclusively, from Europe, their migrations not only transformed the places they left, but profoundly altered American society. These migrations, all of which involved a high degree of choice on the part of their participants, took place within the context of family and communal decision making, which in turn impacted significantly on the women and men who made these journeys, allowing\u2014or forcing\u2014them to create new kinds of identities, institutions, and cultures. They indeed, as a result of their migrations, became new people. They became \u201cethnic,\u201d as they had to redefine themselves both in terms of what they left, what they \u201cbrought\u201d with them, and what they encountered in America. We explore how their journeys lead to the creation of a set of ethnic communities in America, which we can see as specific and unique and yet resembling each other in notable ways, focusing on three seemingly very different nineteenth century groups: Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants and the ethnic cultures they created.      SPRING 2012 MAP-UA  500  Cultures and Contexts: Topics \u2014 Rome Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus Italian culture seen through the lens of its most emblematic site and subject: Rome ancient and modern, mythical and historical, visual and verbal. Epitomizing the very notion of cultural perpetuity, Rome--in its artifacts and images, its politics and its myths, its models of democracy and empire--lurks at the heart of Italian identity. We examine the Eternal City in its aesthetic and historical specificity--its importance as an actual place--and also as an idea and an ideal, put to various political and cultural ends in the formation of Italians' visions of themselves. We thus consider the enduring and shifting significance of Rome for Italian self-understanding: beginning with the founding and development of the city, through its various \"rebirths\" in the Renaissance, the Italian Risorgimento, and the Fascist Regime, and also briefly consider the vitality of Rome and its histories/myths to other national traditions, political movements, and aesthetic programs, from France to the United States.     SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 502 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. el-Leithy (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Societies) syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 502 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies  Prof. Rowson  (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Societies) syllabus The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 507 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Japan Prof. Looser (East Asian Studies) Japanese national identity is the product of a diversity of cultures and communities. Starting with a broad historical overview of this diversity, critical focus is given to those categories commonly used to describe a single coherent \"Japanese\" culture. These include the categories of nation (e.g., Japan as an economic state, Japan as a nation defined by beauty and aesthetics), modernity (e.g., gender, family, ethnicity, new religions), and popular culture (e.g., mass culture, subcultures).  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 508 Cultures and Contexts: The Pacific Islands Prof. Geismar (Anthropology and Museum Studies) syllabus The Pacific Island region sweeps from Easter Island in the East to Papua New Guinea in the West, a vast \u201csea of islands\u201d that has been a crucial space of exchange: of perspectives, materials, people and ideas. What can we learn from the study of this region, a set of islands with both commonalities and differences that is often imagined as one \u201cplace\u201d? We examine the cultures of the Pacific Islands, moving from the first migrations of indigenous navigators through the age of European exploration and colonialism, to the local experience of World War II and contemporary engagements with globalization. We also study the area\u2019s unique cultural configurations of ritual practice, cosmology, and society. Along the way, we engage directly with the voices of Pacific islanders, from those who participated in the voyages of Captain Cook, to indigenous artists who reflect on these complex and entangled histories. Other primary sources include museum collections, film, painting, and other visual representations. This comparative approach enables us to understand debates about colonial encounter, primitivism, cannibalism, cargo cults, nuclear testing, resource extraction, and the morality of diet, from a Pacific perspective.   SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Smith (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 b.c.e. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century b.c.e. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 529 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr \u00e1 n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis) syllabus Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and political life of these communities. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 544  Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain  Prof. Mendelson (Spanish and Portuguese) syllabus  What does Spanish culture look like? What are the different materials that Spanish artists and writers have chosen to articulate the often complex understandings they have of themselves, their nation(s), their relation to modernity (its opportunities and challenges), and the broader international community? We approach Spanish culture critically by learning about specific works and the contexts within which they exist, focusing on the mid-nineteenth century through the late-twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, film (fiction and documentary), painting, poster art, photography, performance, and architecture. Students actively engage in an informed analysis of cultural works from Spain in order to better understand and question the relation between cultural forms and questions of national identity, tradition, modernity, and authorship as they relate to the historical moment and location in which they are produced.   SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew and Judaic Studies) syllabus The development of ancient Egyptian civilization, the basic tenets of its religious beliefs, its social forms and organizations, the conventions and achievements of its literature, art, and architecture. Students learn how scholars have used the remains of this long-vanished culture to reconstruct it and how to employ these methods to analyze texts and artifacts themselves. Materials include a variety of primary sources (literature, architecture, religious writings, works of art, archaeological remains, and administrative documents), and critical evaluation of the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 552 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) &amp; Prof. Cooper (History) syllabus Comparative   study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that   empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights,   belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long   in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom    they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained   social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different   people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political    organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take   account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher   degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority,   sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of   empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that   the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires   were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that   focus on political and economic connections over long distances and   long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the   topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations.   Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol,   Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as   primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial   polities.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA  553  Cultures and Contexts: Pagan Europe Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History) syllabus In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge.         SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 555 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History) syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.    top of page                 Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Cultures & Contexts    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       Cultures & Contexts | 2014-2015 Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus Fall 2014 FALL 2014 CORE-UA 500, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Topics\u2014The Silk Road and Central Asia Prof. Stark (Institute for the Study of the Ancient World)  syllabus For centuries Central Asia has been a conduit for a variety of cultural encounters and transfers between China, India, the Near East and the Mediterranean. In an almost emblematic way, this position and function seems to be embodied in our image of the far-distant caravan trader, traversing on the so-called \u201cSilk roads\u201d the vast expanses between China and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. However, it was not only traders that connected the civilizations of the ancient world via Central Asia: with and next to the traders\u2019 caravans traveled diplomats, missionaries, artists and many more; and vast parts of Eurasia were, again and again, connected and controlled by confederations and empires of nomadic origin. We inquire into the many facets, which characterize the resulting network, oscillating around Central Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the Mongol Empire, taking a multi-disciplinary approach to a considerable variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus The South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality, and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television, internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (History)  syllabus Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 512, Cultures &amp; Contexts: China Prof. Zhang (East Asian Studies)  syllabus  An introduction to the main issues and foundational texts of imperial and modern China. Selected readings include excerpts from early Chinese classics such as Classic of Odes and the Analects to the vernacular novels of late imperial China. The classical canon is then coupled with central texts from modern China, from the initial reflections of the mandarin scholars on a rapidly changing world, to writings on revolution, the modern state, and the new culture of the enlightened individual by leading Chinese intellectuals in the 20th century. Rather than a display of cultural and literary edifices, our intellectual and critical interest is to rethink Chinese traditions, both imperial and modern, in terms of continuity as well as discontinuity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus  Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: African Diaspora Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to non-African influences. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 536, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology)  syllabus  The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Saranillio (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Examines significant historical and contemporary moments through an analysis of culture and power and how cultural productions--film, television dramas, novels, visual art, national monuments and memorials, among others--produce ideas, stories and silences in different historical moments about different Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have contemporary resonance today. For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 540, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Mongol Asia and Its Legacy Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to the outskirts of Central Europe. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. We examine the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective emphasizing the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Themes include nomadic life and culture, the structure of a nomadic empire, how that nomadic empire interacted with the various settled states it conquered, and ramifications of the Mongol conquest on economy and trade, medicine, science and technology, food and art, culture and religion, as well as social and intellectual developments across Eurasia, during the time period from approximately 1200 to 1450 C.E. Our primary sources will be narratives of Mongols generals, stories of peoples they conquered, and travelogues of people who travelled in Mongol territories, and we also look at visual depictions of the Mongols in art and cinema, pay special attention to the environment and how it shaped the life of the Mongols, dedicate time to the image of Genghis Khan, the role played by women, both from the commoner society and from the elite, and interactions with Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, and Islam. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus  Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 552, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and the Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) and Prof. Cooper (History)  syllabus  Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture.

We investigate how empires were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities.

Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus  The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture.

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 505, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 507, Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Kaffen (East Asian Studies)  syllabus Japan from 1945 to the present, through cinema, animation, photography, manga, television, kami shibai, pop songs, and other creative forms of expression and documentation, with emphasis on various points of view both within Japan (women, youth, burakumin, Okinawan), and externally (the US-Japan relationship, Japan\u2019s relationship with its East- Asian neighbors). We consider the ways Japan is framed and imagined, as well as the tensions, contradictions, and variety of perspectives at work in those imaginations; the processes of mediation through which history and place are constructed; and issues such as war responsibility, high economic growth, political radicalism, technology and consumption, and \u201clost decades,\u201d and what they might mean for a consideration of Japan\u2019s place in the world at present. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus  Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times.

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus  Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 541, Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Tortorici (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus  What was America before it was called \u201cAmerica\u201d? How did indigenous peoples understand and document their first encounters with Europeans and Africans? We focus on how the convergence of indigenous, African, European, and Asian peoples in the Americas created complex cultures, societies, ethnicities, and forms of religiosity. Beginning with the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the \u201cIndies\u201d by Christopher Columbus in 1492, we work our way thematically and chronologically through the centuries of conquest and colonial rule, up until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. We also examine the historical context before 1492 in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East (with an emphasis on how particular Old World encounters affected New World encounters). SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History)  syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 553, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Pagan Europe, 60\u20131600 C.E. Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History)  syllabus  In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus  The culture of modern Italy\u2014a nation younger than the United States, yet steeped in all manner of millennial traditions, linguistic dialects, and regional artistic and economic customs. \u201cWe have made Italy; we must now make Italians.\u201d Thus declared the politician and writer Massimo d\u2019Azeglio following the country\u2019s belated unification in 1861. How has Italy attempted to \u201cmake Italians\u201d over the last century? What forms of culture could unify a people so diverse in origins and aspirations? Has the country managed to transform itself from a \u201cgeographic idea\u201d to a cultural reality? Aside from commonplaces\u2014rolling hills, historical landmarks, beloved cuisine, fashion runways\u2014what are the bel paese\u2019s most salient cultural characteristics, and why do they matter? We examine cultural manifestations in various visual, verbal, and material forms: manifestos, cinema, literature, popular music, poetry, architecture, painting, television, exhibitions, and journalism.

Each represents a cultural solution that has influenced the development of Western thought and its history. Yet each is distinctive in its own way, having produced different religious systems, art styles, political and economic organizations and historical trajectories. Study of these early states reveals not only the common thread in the human condition but also the astonishing variability in human behavior and culture. We explore the prehistoric to early historic periods in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and Egypt. Working with archaeological and textual sources, we trace the unique and important transitions from a life as hunters and gatherers to settling down in villages and the development of cities and states, and gain a deep appreciation for the accomplishments of the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians and some sense of our own place in the larger scheme of world history.   FALL 2011 MAP-UA 502 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Chelkowski (MEIS) syllabus Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or as historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200 years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978\u201379 Islamic Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority\u2014some 60%\u2014of the population, but historically they have been deprived of power in the government and of access to the political and economic life of the country. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew and Judaic Studies) syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 534 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Prof. Ralph (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Introduces students to the study of the African continent and the disparate peoples and societies that can be located within a shared historical trajectory. In the process, we will explore the way that different scholars have defined Africa\u2019s historical relationship to the Atlantic World, how they have conceived of what has come to be known as \u201cThe Black Atlantic,\u201d and the ways they have worked to critique and enrich this formulation. This means exploring key events of the modern period\u2014the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions, the Enlightenment, the Transatlantic slave trade, the birth of capitalism, and the formation of international systems for diplomacy and economic exchange\u2014and examining how race, gender, economic standing, social status, generation and ability shape economic and political aspirations and emotional attachments. As a case study, we focus critical attention on the city of New Orleans\u2014first as an early modern commercial shipping center, then as a slave entrep\u00f4t, and finally as a colony of France and then Spain, and finally as a US city\u2014and consider what it means to view New Orleans, and Louisiana more broadly, as part of the African Diaspora. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 536 Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology) syllabus The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 538 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Diaspora Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (History/Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) syllabus Muslim minorities have emerged as a \u201cproblem\u201d and a \u201cchallenge.\u201d However, little is known how they formed and what are their experiences. We explore two such communities whose histories are very different\u2014the Muslims in China and Europe\u2014and get a taste also of their art and music. We also look at some of the many Muslim communities outside of the \"Islamic heartlands,\" that is, beyond what is referred to in Islamic tradition as the \u201cHouse/realm of Islam.\u201d In some cases these \"diaspora\" communities are of considerable vintage: China, for example, has been home to Muslims since the time of the prophet Muhammad. Others are more recent, including those in the Americas and Europe. Islamic diasporas are the result of multiple processes, including trade, migration (forced and voluntary), and missionizing activities, as well as military and political expansion. Islamic culture, gender relations, connections to slavery and concepts of race, theories of government, social movements, scholarship and education, and systems of trade are also analyzed. In the process of examining these issues, certain questions confront us along the way: How real is the distinction between dar al-Islam and dar al-Harb (\u201cHouse of Islam\u201d and \u201cHouse/realm of War\u201d)? How does it affect the perception different Muslim groups have of one another? What is the relationship between pan-Islamic movements and Islamic diasporas/diasporicity? FALL 2011 MAP-UA 539 Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Tu (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis) syllabus Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization, among others. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. As an expression/reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts, we pay particular attention to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions--films, literature, art, media, and popular culture. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Ben-Dor Benite ( History/Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies ) syllabus We discover the ways in which people \u201cdiscovered\u201d the world during the 15th and 16th centuries and ask what gave that period the title: \u201cThe Age of Discovery.\u201d We ask why do people \u201cexplore.\u201d We investigate the ways in which people have created, traveled to, encountered, and reported on \u201cnew-worlds.\u201d We read the accounts of sailors, pirates, merchants, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. We discuss the themes of history, religion, geography, and imagination and see how they shaped the ways in which people encountered new worlds. We ask how \u201cfrontiers\u201d are created and we focus on issues such as: distances and altitudes, culture, modes of travel, food, sex, music, and many others. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese) syllabus What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 543 Cultures and Contexts: Korea Prof. Em (East Asian Studies) syllabus From the late 19th century until today, it can be argued that politically engaged writers in Korea have been preoccupied with two interrelated issues: the national question, as the struggle for national sovereignty during the colonial period (1910-1945), and the dream of reunification following national partition in 1945 and the Korean War (1950-1953); and democracy, as the struggle against authoritarian governments, but also authoritarianism in schools, family, and the workplace, and the struggle to restructure policies, institutions, and practices that render certain groups of people (women, workers, the urban poor, sexual minorities, migrant workers, people with disabilities) unworthy of respect or esteem. We look at how students, workers, and intellectuals write about and mobilized around issues of nation and democracy, issues they saw as structurally linked. We also locate these issues within a broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs  Prof. Morris (Institute for the Study of the Ancient World) syllabus The archaeology, literature, and art of ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity. Settlements that are particularly well documented through both archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal). Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing, attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the construction of well crafted satire. Primary sources include letters, wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, physical anthropology. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 546 Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History) syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 550 Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the Americas Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus The idea of \u201cAmerica\u201d has long been dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists, policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \u201cOld World\u201d tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events (e.g., 19th-20th century migrations of Asians to Central America) and explore how global visions and international movements as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism, cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/creolite emerge from local currents and practices.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 551 Cultures and Contexts: Immigrant America in the 19th Century Prof. Diner (History) syllabus The \u201clong nineteenth century,\u201d from the 1820s through the 1920s saw the arrival of no fewer than 50 million immigrants to the United States. Coming primarily, although not exclusively, from Europe, their migrations not only transformed the places they left, but profoundly altered American society. These migrations, all of which involved a high degree of choice on the part of their participants, took place within the context of family and communal decision making, which in turn impacted significantly on the women and men who made these journeys, allowing\u2014or forcing\u2014them to create new kinds of identities, institutions, and cultures. They indeed, as a result of their migrations, became new people. They became \u201cethnic,\u201d as they had to redefine themselves both in terms of what they left, what they \u201cbrought\u201d with them, and what they encountered in America. We explore how their journeys lead to the creation of a set of ethnic communities in America, which we can see as specific and unique and yet resembling each other in notable ways, focusing on three seemingly very different nineteenth century groups: Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants and the ethnic cultures they created.      SPRING 2012 MAP-UA  500  Cultures and Contexts: Topics \u2014 Rome Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus Italian culture seen through the lens of its most emblematic site and subject: Rome ancient and modern, mythical and historical, visual and verbal. Epitomizing the very notion of cultural perpetuity, Rome--in its artifacts and images, its politics and its myths, its models of democracy and empire--lurks at the heart of Italian identity. We examine the Eternal City in its aesthetic and historical specificity--its importance as an actual place--and also as an idea and an ideal, put to various political and cultural ends in the formation of Italians' visions of themselves. We thus consider the enduring and shifting significance of Rome for Italian self-understanding: beginning with the founding and development of the city, through its various \"rebirths\" in the Renaissance, the Italian Risorgimento, and the Fascist Regime, and also briefly consider the vitality of Rome and its histories/myths to other national traditions, political movements, and aesthetic programs, from France to the United States.     SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 502 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. el-Leithy (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Societies) syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 502 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies  Prof. Rowson  (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Societies) syllabus The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 507 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Japan Prof. Looser (East Asian Studies) Japanese national identity is the product of a diversity of cultures and communities. Starting with a broad historical overview of this diversity, critical focus is given to those categories commonly used to describe a single coherent \"Japanese\" culture. These include the categories of nation (e.g., Japan as an economic state, Japan as a nation defined by beauty and aesthetics), modernity (e.g., gender, family, ethnicity, new religions), and popular culture (e.g., mass culture, subcultures).  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 508 Cultures and Contexts: The Pacific Islands Prof. Geismar (Anthropology and Museum Studies) syllabus The Pacific Island region sweeps from Easter Island in the East to Papua New Guinea in the West, a vast \u201csea of islands\u201d that has been a crucial space of exchange: of perspectives, materials, people and ideas. What can we learn from the study of this region, a set of islands with both commonalities and differences that is often imagined as one \u201cplace\u201d? We examine the cultures of the Pacific Islands, moving from the first migrations of indigenous navigators through the age of European exploration and colonialism, to the local experience of World War II and contemporary engagements with globalization. We also study the area\u2019s unique cultural configurations of ritual practice, cosmology, and society. Along the way, we engage directly with the voices of Pacific islanders, from those who participated in the voyages of Captain Cook, to indigenous artists who reflect on these complex and entangled histories. Other primary sources include museum collections, film, painting, and other visual representations. This comparative approach enables us to understand debates about colonial encounter, primitivism, cannibalism, cargo cults, nuclear testing, resource extraction, and the morality of diet, from a Pacific perspective.   SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Smith (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 b.c.e. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century b.c.e. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 529 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr \u00e1 n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis) syllabus Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and political life of these communities. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 544  Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain  Prof. Mendelson (Spanish and Portuguese) syllabus  What does Spanish culture look like? What are the different materials that Spanish artists and writers have chosen to articulate the often complex understandings they have of themselves, their nation(s), their relation to modernity (its opportunities and challenges), and the broader international community? We approach Spanish culture critically by learning about specific works and the contexts within which they exist, focusing on the mid-nineteenth century through the late-twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, film (fiction and documentary), painting, poster art, photography, performance, and architecture. Students actively engage in an informed analysis of cultural works from Spain in order to better understand and question the relation between cultural forms and questions of national identity, tradition, modernity, and authorship as they relate to the historical moment and location in which they are produced.   SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew and Judaic Studies) syllabus The development of ancient Egyptian civilization, the basic tenets of its religious beliefs, its social forms and organizations, the conventions and achievements of its literature, art, and architecture. Students learn how scholars have used the remains of this long-vanished culture to reconstruct it and how to employ these methods to analyze texts and artifacts themselves. Materials include a variety of primary sources (literature, architecture, religious writings, works of art, archaeological remains, and administrative documents), and critical evaluation of the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 552 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) &amp; Prof. Cooper (History) syllabus Comparative   study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that   empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights,   belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long   in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom    they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained   social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different   people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political    organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take   account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher   degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority,   sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of   empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that   the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires   were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that   focus on political and economic connections over long distances and   long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the   topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations.   Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol,   Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as   primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial   polities.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA  553  Cultures and Contexts: Pagan Europe Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History) syllabus In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge.         SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 555 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History) syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.    top of page                 Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Cultures & Contexts    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       Cultures & Contexts | 2014-2015 Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus Fall 2014 FALL 2014 CORE-UA 500, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Topics\u2014The Silk Road and Central Asia Prof. Stark (Institute for the Study of the Ancient World)  syllabus For centuries Central Asia has been a conduit for a variety of cultural encounters and transfers between China, India, the Near East and the Mediterranean. In an almost emblematic way, this position and function seems to be embodied in our image of the far-distant caravan trader, traversing on the so-called \u201cSilk roads\u201d the vast expanses between China and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. However, it was not only traders that connected the civilizations of the ancient world via Central Asia: with and next to the traders\u2019 caravans traveled diplomats, missionaries, artists and many more; and vast parts of Eurasia were, again and again, connected and controlled by confederations and empires of nomadic origin. We inquire into the many facets, which characterize the resulting network, oscillating around Central Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the Mongol Empire, taking a multi-disciplinary approach to a considerable variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus The South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality, and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television, internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (History)  syllabus Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 512, Cultures &amp; Contexts: China Prof. Zhang (East Asian Studies)  syllabus  An introduction to the main issues and foundational texts of imperial and modern China. Selected readings include excerpts from early Chinese classics such as Classic of Odes and the Analects to the vernacular novels of late imperial China. The classical canon is then coupled with central texts from modern China, from the initial reflections of the mandarin scholars on a rapidly changing world, to writings on revolution, the modern state, and the new culture of the enlightened individual by leading Chinese intellectuals in the 20th century. Rather than a display of cultural and literary edifices, our intellectual and critical interest is to rethink Chinese traditions, both imperial and modern, in terms of continuity as well as discontinuity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus  Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: African Diaspora Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to non-African influences. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 536, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology)  syllabus  The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Saranillio (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Examines significant historical and contemporary moments through an analysis of culture and power and how cultural productions--film, television dramas, novels, visual art, national monuments and memorials, among others--produce ideas, stories and silences in different historical moments about different Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have contemporary resonance today. For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 540, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Mongol Asia and Its Legacy Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to the outskirts of Central Europe. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. We examine the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective emphasizing the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Themes include nomadic life and culture, the structure of a nomadic empire, how that nomadic empire interacted with the various settled states it conquered, and ramifications of the Mongol conquest on economy and trade, medicine, science and technology, food and art, culture and religion, as well as social and intellectual developments across Eurasia, during the time period from approximately 1200 to 1450 C.E. Our primary sources will be narratives of Mongols generals, stories of peoples they conquered, and travelogues of people who travelled in Mongol territories, and we also look at visual depictions of the Mongols in art and cinema, pay special attention to the environment and how it shaped the life of the Mongols, dedicate time to the image of Genghis Khan, the role played by women, both from the commoner society and from the elite, and interactions with Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, and Islam. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus  Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 552, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and the Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) and Prof. Cooper (History)  syllabus  Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 555, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History)  syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus  The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 505, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 507, Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Kaffen (East Asian Studies)  syllabus Japan from 1945 to the present, through cinema, animation, photography, manga, television, kami shibai, pop songs, and other creative forms of expression and documentation, with emphasis on various points of view both within Japan (women, youth, burakumin, Okinawan), and externally (the US-Japan relationship, Japan\u2019s relationship with its East- Asian neighbors). We consider the ways Japan is framed and imagined, as well as the tensions, contradictions, and variety of perspectives at work in those imaginations; the processes of mediation through which history and place are constructed; and issues such as war responsibility, high economic growth, political radicalism, technology and consumption, and \u201clost decades,\u201d and what they might mean for a consideration of Japan\u2019s place in the world at present. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus  Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus  Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 541, Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Tortorici (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus  What was America before it was called \u201cAmerica\u201d? How did indigenous peoples understand and document their first encounters with Europeans and Africans? We focus on how the convergence of indigenous, African, European, and Asian peoples in the Americas created complex cultures, societies, ethnicities, and forms of religiosity. Beginning with the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the \u201cIndies\u201d by Christopher Columbus in 1492, we work our way thematically and chronologically through the centuries of conquest and colonial rule, up until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. We also examine the historical context before 1492 in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East (with an emphasis on how particular Old World encounters affected New World encounters). SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History)  syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 553, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Pagan Europe, 60\u20131600 C.E. Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History)  syllabus  In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus  The culture of modern Italy\u2014a nation younger than the United States, yet steeped in all manner of millennial traditions, linguistic dialects, and regional artistic and economic customs. \u201cWe have made Italy; we must now make Italians.\u201d Thus declared the politician and writer Massimo d\u2019Azeglio following the country\u2019s belated unification in 1861. How has Italy attempted to \u201cmake Italians\u201d over the last century? What forms of culture could unify a people so diverse in origins and aspirations? Has the country managed to transform itself from a \u201cgeographic idea\u201d to a cultural reality? Aside from commonplaces\u2014rolling hills, historical landmarks, beloved cuisine, fashion runways\u2014what are the bel paese\u2019s most salient cultural characteristics, and why do they matter? We examine cultural manifestations in various visual, verbal, and material forms: manifestos, cinema, literature, popular music, poetry, architecture, painting, television, exhibitions, and journalism.

Our approach is multidisciplinary throughout\u2014we read and discuss texts, look at visual materials, listen to music, and also explore social and political aspects of Jewish-Muslim relations. We think about how Jewish and Muslim communal life, practices, and politics converged and diverged. Our purpose is not to present Jews and Muslims living harmoniously with one another but to understand how interactions between the groups shaped the development of their religions in key moments in history up to the contemporary period.

We focus on Chinese maritime, scientific, and artistic history, and see how it was shaped through numerous connections with the \u201coutside\u201d world. We begin with the group of small embattled polities that in 7th and 6th centuries BCE came to understand themselves as \u201cZhongguo\u201d or Central Kingdoms and we continue with the rise of various imperial dynasties that united China and their interactions with numerous regions\u2014Indian, Inner Asian, Central Asian, South East Asian, and European. At the same time we study the interactions with the Buddhist, Islamic, and Christian-Europeans. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 512 Cultures &amp; Contexts: China Prof. Karl (East Asian Studies)   syllabus  A multi-disciplinary examination of the global and domestic forces shaping modern China, extensively using Chinese sources in translation. Introduces students to some of the major historical, economic, cultural-literary, and social trends in thought and practice contributing to China's modern transformation, with a concentrated focus on the 19th and 20th centuries. Analytical technique, close textual reading, and contextual synthesis are the methodological points emphasized.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 514 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Smith (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 b.c.e. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century b.c.e.

FALL 2013 MAP-UA 529 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Flores (Social and Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Latino cultures are present everywhere in contemporary American life, and are reshaping what it means to be American. Beginning with an overview of Latin American cultural theory going back to the time of the Spanish conquest--and including such thinkers as Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, and Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos--we then trace the development of Latino cultural identity, examining issues of race, citizenship, gender, class, and sexuality, in seeking to gain a critical perspective on Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and other Latino communities in today's society. Turing to the dramatic political and cultural movements of the 1960s and 1970s, we then study the emergence of the idea of a pan-ethnic \"Latino\" identity encompassing all of the diverse national groups, with attention to instances of this new situation in music, literature, performance, and media representation. Some of the cultural forms and styles to be considered include salsa, border art, Nuyorican poetry, hip hop, and reggaeton; and students are encouraged to engage in and report about the many Latino cultural institutions and movements here in New York City. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 532 Cultures &amp; Contexts: African Diaspora Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus The   dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time,   examining their experiences and those of their descendants.

For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society.

FALL 2013 MAP-UA 544 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 545 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 546 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History)  syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus Italian culture seen through the lens of its most emblematic site and subject: Rome ancient and modern, mythical and historical, visual and verbal. Epitomizing the very notion of cultural perpetuity, Rome--in its artifacts and images, its politics and its myths, its models of democracy and empire--lurks at the heart of Italian identity. We examine the Eternal City in its aesthetic and historical specificity--its importance as an actual place--and also as an idea and an ideal, put to various political and cultural ends in the formation of Italians' visions of themselves. We thus consider the enduring and shifting significance of Rome for Italian self-understanding: beginning with the founding and development of the city, through its various \"rebirths\" in the Renaissance, the Italian Risorgimento, and the Fascist Regime, and also briefly consider the vitality of Rome and its histories/myths to other national traditions, political movements, and aesthetic programs, from France to the United States. Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 501 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Early States in Mesopotamia and Egypt Prof. Wright (Anthropology)   syllabus Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia are the homeland of the world's first and most spectacular early states. Each represents a cultural solution that has influenced the development of Western thought and its history. Yet each is distinctive in its own way, having produced different religious systems, art styles, political and economic organizations and historical trajectories. Study of these early states reveals not only the common thread in the human condition but also the astonishing variability in human behavior and culture. We explore the prehistoric to early historic periods in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and Egypt. Working with archaeological and textual sources, we trace the unique and important transitions from a life as hunters and gatherers to settling down in villages and the development of cities and states, and gain a deep appreciation for the accomplishments of the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians and some sense of our own place in the larger scheme of world history. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 502 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. el-Leithy (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 502 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)   syllabus The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 507 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Japan Prof. Solt (History)  syllabus Postwar Japan, 1945 to Present. An inquiry into Japan's social, political, and economic transformation since World War II. Examines the role of the Cold War, the U.S. Occupation, the \"Peace\" Constitution, the symbolic monarchy, the economic \"miracle,\" corporate structure, the gendering of labor, and the legacy of war in shaping the history of postwar Japan. An underlying theme is the connection between political economy and culture. As such, we focus on the geopolitical and economic structures underpinning the visible transformations in everyday life and try to connect these transformations in Japanese history to broader themes in global history. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 510 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (Russian &amp; Slavic Studies)   syllabus  Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 514 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Smith (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 b.c.e. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century b.c.e. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 515 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 534 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Black Atlantic Prof. Morgan (Social and Cultural Analysis)  syllabus This course considers the Black Atlantic as a socio-cultural economic space from the first arrival of Africans in the \u2018New World,\u2019 beginning around in the 15th century, through the rise of slavery in the Americas. During this class we will trace the origins and importance of the concept of the Black Atlantic within broad political contexts, paying special attention to the changing social, cultural and economic relations that shaped community formation among people of African descent and laid the foundations for modern political and economic orders. Once we have established those foundations, we will think about the Black Atlantic as a critical site of cultural production. Using the frame of the Atlantic to ask questions about the relationship between culture and political economy. We will explore a range of genres--film, fiction, music, as well as formal scholarship--so as to explore questions of evidence in the context of the real and the imaginary. Topics to be covered include African enslavement and settlement in Africa and the Americas; the development of transatlantic racial capitalism; variations in politics and culture between empires in the Atlantic world; creolization, plantation slavery and slave society; the politics and culture of the enslaved; the Haitian Revolution; slave emancipation; and contemporary black Atlantic politics and racial capitalism. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 536 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology)  syllabus The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 537 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Engel (Hebrew and Judaic Studies)  syllabus Explores the cultural values and expressions through which residents of the modern State of Israel have tried to come to grips with the manifold challenges their country has faced since its inception in 1948. Its founders envisioned citizens would initiate extensive changes in their economic and political behavior, family life, attitudes toward their bodies, relations with their neighbors, religious outlook, and view of their place in the world, and expected that these would find concrete expression in literature, art, music, architecture, and intellectual life. But they did not anticipate the challenges of rapid mass immigration, periodic wars, shifting geopolitical alignments, transformation of the global economy, and sweeping technological innovations. We analyze these far-reaching changes in the context in which Israeli culture has functioned and investigate how that culture has responded to them, drawing on journalistic accounts, short stories, and Israeli films and television programs.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 541 Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Eustace (History)  syllabus During the Atlantic Age of Sail, from the fifteenth though the nineteenth centuries, the peoples of four continents\u2014Europe, Africa, North American and South America\u2014began to interact in sustained and complex ways for the first time. They brought to their encounters diverse cosmologies (beliefs about the spiritual world), epistemologies (systems of knowing and gathering empirical knowledge), family formations (networks of kinship), state configurations (forms of political organization), trading patterns (systems of material accumulation and exchange), and traditions of war and peace (forms of conflict and negotiation across groups). From their divergent approaches to the distribution and regulation of land, population, and goods arose a complex new transoceanic system that would tie together these four corners of the Atlantic. Reading early historical accounts, travel narratives, personal memoirs, novels, poems, and plays, we see how Atlantic peoples make sense of their changing worlds and the creative tensions of encounter, and come to understand the productive conflicts that ultimately gave rise to an Age of Atlantic Revolutions.  SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 543 Cultures and Contexts: Korea Prof. Yi (East Asian Studies)  syllabus A multi-disciplinary introduction to Korean society and culture, surveying Korean history from antiquity to the present though a wide range of primary sources from the past, including archaeological relics, written records, and works of art, as well as contemporary materials by Korean authors, directors, and other cultural producers. Considers the origins of Korean \u201ctradition,\u201d the formation and development of social relations, popular beliefs, and systems of thought that have shaped the Korean way of life, in order to locate their resonances and ramifications in modern Korea, particularly in cultural representations. Continues with Korea\u2019s \u201ctransformation\u201d through its encounter with the West, its modern experiences and national struggle under colonial rule, social upheavals after liberation, and the Korean War. Concludes by tracing the enduring impacts of the unresolved past on contemporary society, Korea \u201ctoday\u201d in terms of economic development and crisis, the democracy movement and its limitations, relations with North Korea and with the US, and sociocultural diversification in the age of globalization. To forge critical perspectives on Korean history, society, and culture, students are encouraged to situate these topics within the broader contexts of East Asia and the world. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 544 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Mendelson (Spanish)  syllabus What   does Spanish culture look like? What are the different materials that   Spanish artists and writers have chosen to articulate the often complex   understandings they have of themselves, their nation(s), their relation   to modernity (its opportunities and challenges), and the broader   international community? We approach Spanish culture critically by   learning about specific works and the contexts within which they exist,   focusing on the mid-nineteenth century through the late-twentieth   century, including fiction, poetry, film (fiction and documentary),   painting, poster art, photography, performance, and architecture.   Students actively engage in an informed analysis of cultural works from   Spain in order to better understand and question the relation between   cultural forms and questions of national identity, tradition, modernity,   and authorship as they relate to the historical moment and location in   which they are produced.    top of page           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
