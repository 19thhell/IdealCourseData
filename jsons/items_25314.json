To download a visa application form, click here .    Vaccinations : In order to enter Uganda, visitors are required to show evidence of yellow fever vaccination for this mosquito-borne disease endemic to the tropical belt. Students should visit a health-care provider to determine the medications for vaccine-preventable diseases and other diseases. Make a visit at least 4&ndash;6 weeks before your trip to allow time for your vaccines to take effect and, if necessary, to start taking medicine to prevent any illness. The NYU Health Center recommends vaccinations specifically for: Hepatitis A, Typhoid, Polio Booster, Tetanus (make sure your shot is up-to-date), and Malaria.    In order to best protect yourself from contracting Malaria, it is most important to take anti-malaria medications and to use a strong insect DEET-based repellent. Malerone is a popular anti-malaria medications, and must be taken for 2 days before traveling to Uganda. Some individuals have difficulty with Malarone, so be sure to discuss this medication with your doctor prior to usage. We also recommend that you travel with nets and anti-mosquito sprays, and to wear clothing that covers your entire body at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most abundant. On a separate note, it is important to know that Uganda is referred to as a global leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
