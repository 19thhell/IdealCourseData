Prerequisites : To take this course, you must have taken Principles of Biology (V23.0011-12) and preferably Molecular and Cell Biology (V23.0021-22), Genetics, or the permission of the instructor. An understanding of fundamental genetic principles is required.           For more information about the organization of this course, click on the Course Info button.           ( Return to top of page. )            About the organization of these pages           The pages are organized by topic , not necessarily by lecture. Therefore, the &quot;Lecture notes&quot; on particular pages may correspond to only part of a lecture or to a couple of lectures.           There are several ways to navigate this site:                      Sequentially: On each page, there are &quot;buttons&quot; on the left side that will lead you (1) back to this &quot;Home&quot; page, (2) to the &quot;Course Info&quot; page that can direct you to pages detailing the organization and requirements of the course itself, or (3) to the &quot;Course Material&quot; page that allows you to surf through the subject matter that is explored in this course in lecture notes, exercises, simulations, and so on. At the bottom of each page are &quot;buttons&quot; (with and without a graphic) that will lead to &quot;parent&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, or &quot;sibling&quot; pages relevant to your current area of the site.                       Using the Site Tree: On the left side of each page there is a &quot;button&quot; labeled &quot;Site Tree&quot;. If and only if your browser has Java capability , clicking on this button will start a little &quot;applet&quot; program that will show you the hierarchical organization of this site as a &quot;tree&quot; (interestingly similar in structure to the organization of the classification systems for living organisms). As your mouse pointer travels over the tree, different icons are highlighted that represent pages in the site. Clicking on a particular page icon should bring you to that page. If your browser is not completely compatible with this applet, you may find it useful simply to copy down the structure of the site and use the navigation buttons described above. If this applet is completely incompatible with your browser, you will find the syllabus page useful as a jump site (described next).                       Via the Syllabus: The syllabus page not only depicts the organization of the lectures, but also serves as a jump site for all other pages via hypertext links. A &quot;button&quot; for the syllabus page is now installed at the left border of each page below the &quot;Site Tree&quot; button.

These pages are only designed as supplementary material and are not meant as a substitute for lectures or readings!           This site will contain lecture notes, sample exam questions, exercises, and links to supplemental information, simulations and software FTP sites.

Prerequisites : To take this course, you must have taken Principles of Biology (V23.0011-12) and preferably Molecular and Cell Biology (V23.0021-22), Genetics, or the permission of the instructor. An understanding of fundamental genetic principles is required.           For more information about the organization of this course, click on the Course Info button.           ( Return to top of page. )            About the organization of these pages           The pages are organized by topic , not necessarily by lecture. Therefore, the &quot;Lecture notes&quot; on particular pages may correspond to only part of a lecture or to a couple of lectures.           There are several ways to navigate this site:                      Sequentially: On each page, there are &quot;buttons&quot; on the left side that will lead you (1) back to this &quot;Home&quot; page, (2) to the &quot;Course Info&quot; page that can direct you to pages detailing the organization and requirements of the course itself, or (3) to the &quot;Course Material&quot; page that allows you to surf through the subject matter that is explored in this course in lecture notes, exercises, simulations, and so on. At the bottom of each page are &quot;buttons&quot; (with and without a graphic) that will lead to &quot;parent&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, or &quot;sibling&quot; pages relevant to your current area of the site.                       Using the Site Tree: On the left side of each page there is a &quot;button&quot; labeled &quot;Site Tree&quot;. If and only if your browser has Java capability , clicking on this button will start a little &quot;applet&quot; program that will show you the hierarchical organization of this site as a &quot;tree&quot; (interestingly similar in structure to the organization of the classification systems for living organisms). As your mouse pointer travels over the tree, different icons are highlighted that represent pages in the site. Clicking on a particular page icon should bring you to that page. If your browser is not completely compatible with this applet, you may find it useful simply to copy down the structure of the site and use the navigation buttons described above. If this applet is completely incompatible with your browser, you will find the syllabus page useful as a jump site (described next).                       Via the Syllabus: The syllabus page not only depicts the organization of the lectures, but also serves as a jump site for all other pages via hypertext links. A &quot;button&quot; for the syllabus page is now installed at the left border of each page below the &quot;Site Tree&quot; button.

These pages are only designed as supplementary material and are not meant as a substitute for lectures or readings!           This site will contain lecture notes, sample exam questions, exercises, and links to supplemental information, simulations and software FTP sites.

NYU Biology's growth in Evolutionary Biology has been built largely at the interfaces of disciplines already strong in the department: developmental genetics, genomics and systems biology, and molecular evolution/systematics. As such, areas of focus include: Molecular and Genomic Evolution, Evolutionary Systems Biology, Experimental Evolution, Evolution of Developmental Systems and Molecular Systematics/Phylogenetics. Research opportunities span different levels of organization, such as: molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of genomes, gene-interaction networks, developmental and genetic processes, morphology and adaptive features; phylogenetic relationships and character evolution; the genetic/genomic architectures of populations; and the history of life on earth. Model organisms used in these studies include bacteria, single-celled eukaryotes, plants, nematode worms, flies and parasitic wasps, plants, cave fish, and primates. Theory and computational biology are regularly integrated with the experimental work to build explanatory models. Major facilities and resources at NYU Biology supporting these studies include: the Sequencing (GenCore) Facility (high-throughput sequencing and expression analysis), the Computational Core , an Imaging Core (with confocal and other microscopes), and special collections (e.g. the NYU Rhabditid Collection with live strains of &gt;150 nematode species). Our research and education missions in evolutionary biology are assisted by associations with other NYU departments ( Anthropology , Computer Science ), the American Museum of Natural History , the New York Botanical Garden , and the Wildlife Conservation Society .  Ecology and Environmental Biology at NYU covers interactions among organisms, environments, and Earth. For research, Ecology and Environmental Biology draws on the diverse interests of our faculty across a range of levels from microbes and invertebrates to mammals and ecosystems, and includes geosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. Current areas of focus include: Climate Change, Biogeochemistry, Mass Extinctions, Disease Ecology, Biodiversity, and Landscape Ecology. Most faculty have joint or associated appointments with the Environmental Studies Program . Research approaches incorporate field work, laboratory analysis, computer modeling, and data and interdisciplinary systems analysis.
