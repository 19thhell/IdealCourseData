Careers    Given today's ubiquitous computing, organizations have a critical need for people who understand, in depth, both computers and business. The most successful technology leaders, from Bill Gates to Andy Grove to Steve Case, are those with deep expertise in technology and business strategy. Successful new technology products and information systems always combine technical quality and smart business strategy. Developing these systems requires extensive communications among technical developers, business managers and users.    The Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) program focuses on training students in the core concepts of computing and business so graduates can develop successful careers in management positions that require deep technical skills.    For example, MSIS graduates have excelled in the following careers.       At software vendors:      Product manager    Requirements analyst    Programming team leader          In Information Technology (IT) departments:      CIO    VP IT operations    Systems architect    Internal requirements analyst    Development team leader          At consulting companies:      Strategic technology consultant             MSIS students draw from the same courses as Courant Computer Science graduate students and Stern MBA students. The MSIS program offers the academic equivalent of an abbreviated combined Computer Science Master's and MBA degree.    Curriculum    The MSIS degree requires 13 courses (39 credits), 5 Stern courses, 5 Computer Science (CS) courses, an Information Technology Projects course and 2 free electives which may be taken at CS or Stern.    The Graduate School of Arts &amp; Science requires that students maintain good standing throughout their studies. This involves sustaining a grade-point average of at least 3.0 (B) each semester, successfully completing at least 66% (2/3) of all courses attempted, and completing the degree within five years. Students falling below the GPA and course completion requirements are placed on probation, and given until the following fall or spring semester to return to good standing, or faced with possible academic dismissal from the program.    The following course distribution is required (3 credits per course unless otherwise noted):       Stern Courses      Two General Business Core Courses (6 credits). The following are recommended:      B01.1302 Managing Organizations    B01.1303 Understanding Firms and Markets    B01.1305 Statistics &amp; Data Analysis    B01.1306 Financial Accounting and Reporting    B01.2123 Global Business Environment: Trade and Investment (1.5 credits) AND B01.2125 The Global Business Environment: International Macroeconomics and Finance (1.5 credits)    B01.2310 Marketing Concepts and Strategies    B01.2311 Foundations of Finance    B01.2314 Operations          Three Information Systems Courses (9 credits). The following are recommended:      B20.2314 Managing the Digital Firm    B20.3322 Designing &amp; Developing Web-based Systems    B20.3336 Data Mining and Knowledge Systems    B20.3338 Electronic Commerce    B20.3350 Financial Information Systems    B20.3362 Current Topics (Advanced Technology)                Computer Science Courses      G22.1170 Fundamental Algorithms is required    Two of the following 3 courses are required:      G22.2262 Data Communications and Networks    G22.2250 Operating Systems    G22.2433 Database Systems          The Information Technology Projects Course (G22.3812-001) is required    Two CS electives are required          Two additional electives from either CS or Stern.       A total of 13 courses (39 credits) are required.    Capstone \"Information Technology (IT) Projects\" Course    One of the last courses an MSIS student takes is IT Projects . This course is a unique software engineering and project management practicum. IT Projects offer students real world experience understanding and solving IT solutions to business problems via participation in a set of team projects at clients such as local corporations, non-profits and government agencies. Each team of about 4 students undertakes one IT project that lasts a semester. The course offers an opportunity to experience (most of) the complete IT project life cycle. The following steps of an IT project are taught and practiced:       Analyze business goals    Gather requirements    Develop project specification    Estimate effort    Allocate tasks to team members    Develop schedule    Obtain approval of specification and project plan    Develop prototype    Review code       The course encourages students to learn to balance 'analysis' and 'implementation' efforts to produce good software efficiently. It teaches students about the wide range of project management methodologies and approaches so they can think about how to choose the correct approach. In some cases, the Projects course has led to students obtaining employment with the clients served by the course.    Admissions Process    Note: please refer to the full set of instructions and guidelines listed on the Computer Science Department Graduate Admissions page.    Candidates apply to the MSIS program through the Computer Science department in the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Applicants must have an undergraduate degree.

Students falling below the GPA and course completion requirements are placed on probation, and given until the following fall or spring semester to return to good standing, or faced with possible academic dismissal from the program.    The following course distribution is required (3 credits per course unless otherwise noted):       Stern Courses      Two General Business Core Courses (6 credits). The following are recommended:      B01.1302 Managing Organizations    B01.1303 Understanding Firms and Markets    B01.1305 Statistics &amp; Data Analysis    B01.1306 Financial Accounting and Reporting    B01.2123 Global Business Environment: Trade and Investment (1.5 credits) AND B01.2125 The Global Business Environment: International Macroeconomics and Finance (1.5 credits)    B01.2310 Marketing Concepts and Strategies    B01.2311 Foundations of Finance    B01.2314 Operations          Three Information Systems Courses (9 credits). The following are recommended:      B20.2314 Managing the Digital Firm    B20.3322 Designing &amp; Developing Web-based Systems    B20.3336 Data Mining and Knowledge Systems    B20.3338 Electronic Commerce    B20.3350 Financial Information Systems    B20.3362 Current Topics (Advanced Technology)                Computer Science Courses      G22.1170 Fundamental Algorithms is required    Two of the following 3 courses are required:      G22.2262 Data Communications and Networks    G22.2250 Operating Systems    G22.2433 Database Systems          The Information Technology Projects Course (G22.3812-001) is required    Two CS electives are required          Two additional electives from either CS or Stern.       A total of 13 courses (39 credits) are required.    Capstone \"Information Technology (IT) Projects\" Course    One of the last courses an MSIS student takes is IT Projects . This course is a unique software engineering and project management practicum. IT Projects offer students real world experience understanding and solving IT solutions to business problems via participation in a set of team projects at clients such as local corporations, non-profits and government agencies. Each team of about 4 students undertakes one IT project that lasts a semester. The course offers an opportunity to experience (most of) the complete IT project life cycle. The following steps of an IT project are taught and practiced:       Analyze business goals    Gather requirements    Develop project specification    Estimate effort    Allocate tasks to team members    Develop schedule    Obtain approval of specification and project plan    Develop prototype    Review code       The course encourages students to learn to balance 'analysis' and 'implementation' efforts to produce good software efficiently. It teaches students about the wide range of project management methodologies and approaches so they can think about how to choose the correct approach. In some cases, the Projects course has led to students obtaining employment with the clients served by the course.    Admissions Process    Note: please refer to the full set of instructions and guidelines listed on the Computer Science Department Graduate Admissions page.    Candidates apply to the MSIS program through the Computer Science department in the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Applicants must have an undergraduate degree. When completing the GSAS application form, under \"Proposed Education Program,\" mark the department as \"Computer Science\" (code CSCI), and the proposed field of study as \"M.S. in I.S.\" (code MSIS). An application must contain:       GRE general scores    A detailed resume    Three reference letters    A completed application form    An undergraduate transcript    Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score, if English is not the applicant's native language       All documents not in English must be accompanied by original certified English translations.    Admissions standards    Applications are reviewed by the Computer Science department. Typical admission standards follow, although exceptions sometimes arise.

Our recent work, as part of collaborative teams of systems biologists and  computational biologists, has recently resulted in genome-wide models that are capable of simulating the functioning of the genome in real time (Bonneau, et. al, 2006, Cell). Dr. Bonneau's lab develops new algorithms that attempt to learn the regulatory networks (their topology and dynamical parameters) that are at the core of biological systems. This work was featured in a 2008 Discover Article, where Dr. Bonneau was selected as one of the top 20 scientists under 40. This work is collaborative work that relies on NYU's local expertise in Machine Learning, Modeling complex systems and their dynamics, and Genomics.  Links:   Bonneau Lab     With Ph.D. student Eugene Weinstein and Google researcher Pedro Moreno, Mehryar Mohri is working on audio fingerprinting techniques that enable computers to recognize songs. This work represents songs in terms of \"music phonemes\", elementary units of music sound that are learned from data, and uses weighted finite-state transducers to construct a compact and efficient index of a large database of songs. The image depicts an example of such a transducer. As a result, songs can be recognized quickly and accurately when only a recording of a short \"audio snippet\" is available and even when the recording is distorted. The group has created a working system with a database of 15,000 songs. Moreover, it has proven new bounds on the size of the indexing finite automata used that guarantee the compactness of this representation as the number of songs indexed increases and suggests that their techniques scale to much larger song data sets.
