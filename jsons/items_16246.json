national communities and across nations. The program is motivated by the conviction that understanding the complex dynamics of peace and conflict can facilitate the work of making the world a more just and peaceful place.   The Peace Studies program draws on tools and methods from an array of disciplines in order to examine both the sources of conflict and the strategies and institutions that aim to resolve or prevent conflict, from methods of grass-roots local engagement to diplomacy, mediation, and international intervention. It analyzes peacemaking strategies across vastly divergent scales, from the contributions of individuals and small groups to the work of nations and multilateral organizations.&amp;nbsp;In addition to the social, economic, and political dynamics affecting peace and conflict, the Peace Studies program also investigates the psychological factors that can cause or resolve conflict, such as the psychological roots of prejudice and aggression and the psychological origins of attitudes of reconciliation and cooperation that allow enemies to transcend seemingly intractable conflicts and societies to build bridges across painful and deeply-rooted divides.   Additional courses rooted in the humanities and arts aim to deepen our understanding of the philosophical and human dimensions of peace and conflict. They pose questions such as: Can war ever be just? Can the priority of peace ever be used as a tool to preserve unjust institutions? More generally, these courses raise the question of whether the exercise of artistic creativity or inquiry into the human condition can foster peacebuilding, cross-cultural communication, and a greater sense of empathy with other human beings.     The ideas and issues addressed by the Peace Studies concentration include:     the challenges and strategies involved in promoting the peaceful resolution of conflict   the costs of conflict and of the reconstruction of post-conflict societies from economic, social, psychological, and legal perspectives   conflict and non-violence   the psychological dimensions of conflict, prejudice, cooperation, and reconciliation   peacekeeping   transitional justice and post-conflict reconciliation   post-conflict state-building   migration and post-conflict economic development   disarmament   international law and governance   the ethics of war and peace   the history of wars and peacemaking   artistic responses to war and roles for art in peacebuilding     The program draws on courses in the Arts and Humanities, Social Science, and Science as well as pre-professional courses in Law and in Leadership and Social Entrepreneurship. Students interested in international relations, comparative politics, economic development, social change and social justice, public service, anthropology, the arts and humanities may find special relevance in the Peace Studies program, as will students participating in Engineers for Social Impact, an activity organized by the Engineering program.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict. Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso, Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among others.

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a &ldquo;just war,&rdquo; as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LAW-AD 212J International Law                                                                              &ldquo;Inter-national&rdquo; law, which the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham defined as the rules governing sovereign nations, is today more like a curriculum than a single course. Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest,  violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

PEACE-AD 120 Transitional Justice                                                        How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

PEACE-AD 121 International Organizations and Global Governance                                                        The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the  UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they  provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international system.

PEACE-AD 123 Peacebuilding                                                        This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regions.

PEACE-AD 124 Causes and Prevention of Violence                                             This course will study violence as a problem in public health and preventive medicine &ndash; indeed, the most important problem, since it could potentially, in this age of nuclear weapons, cause the self-extinction of the human species. To do so, we will review writings that illuminate and illustrate the causes and prevention of violence, including wars and civil wars, inter-ethnic violence, revolutions, genocide, terrorism and structural violence. We will study how the moral emotions, shame and guilt, can motivate as well as inhibit both group and individual violence. We will also examine cognitive causes of violence, including the backlash, in the form of &ldquo;political religions&rdquo; &ndash; Nationalism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism, and most recently, Apocalyptic Fundamentalism -- against the modern scientific world-view and its challenge to the credibility of the traditional sources of moral and political authority. Readings will include the Bible and works by Thucydides, Shakespeare, Buchner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, Adorno, Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt.

POLSC-AD 176J Nation-Building                                                                   Nation-Building explores the range of strategies which strong states use in order to build the capacity of weak ones. This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &quot;democracy promotion&quot; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency.

We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.
