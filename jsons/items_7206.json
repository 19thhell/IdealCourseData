She did her Doctorate in Russian History at Yale. She published her dissertation on the origins of the Zaporogian (Ukrainian) cossacks, but soon left that region behind to become one of a pioneering generation of historians of the US examining women and gender. Before coming to NYU in 1998 Gordon taught at the University of Wisconsin/Madison where she was awarded the university's most prestigious chair professorship, the Vilas Research Chair. Today she is a University Professor of the Humanities and professor of history at NYU, teaching courses on gender, social movements, imperialism and the 20th-century US in general. She has won many prestigious awards, including Guggenheim, NEH, ACLS, Radcliffe Institute and the New York Public Library\u00b9s Cullman Center fellowships.     For the first part of her career, most of Gordon's writing examined the historical roots of contemporary social policy debates in the US, particularly as they concern gender and family issues. Her first book, Woman's Body, Woman's Right: The History of Birth Control in America (Viking/Penguin, 1976), published in 1976 and reissued in 1990, remains the definitive history of birth-control politics in the US. It was completely revised and re-published as The Moral Property of Women in 2002. In 1988 she published a historical study of how the US has dealt with family violence, including child abuse, book, spousal violence and sexual abuse. Heroes of Their Own Lives: The History and Politics of Family Violence (Viking/Penguin, 1988) won the Joan Kelly prize of the American Historical Association. Gordon served on the Departments of Justice/Health and Human Services Advisory Council on Violence Against Women for the Clinton administration (a council abolished by the Bush administration). Her history of welfare, Pitied But Not Entitled: Single Mothers and the History of Welfare (Free Press, 1994), won the Berkshire Prize and the Gustavus Myers Human Rights Award.     Changing direction, Gordon turned to narrative as a way of bringing large-scale historical developments to life. Her 1999 book, The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction, the story of a vigilante action against Mexican-Americans, won the Bancroft prize for best book in American history and the Beveridge prize for best book on the history of the Western Hemisphere. In the process of researching her most recent book, she discovered an important group of Lange photographs long unnoticed and never published: photographs of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, commissioned by the US Army but then impounded because they were too critical of the internment policy. Gordon selected 119 of this images and published them in 2006, with introductory essays by herself and by historian Gary Okihiro, as Impounded: Dorothea Lange and Japanese Americans in World War II.

She did her Doctorate in Russian History at Yale. She published her dissertation on the origins of the Zaporogian (Ukrainian) cossacks, but soon left that region behind to become one of a pioneering generation of historians of the US examining women and gender. Before coming to NYU in 1998 Gordon taught at the University of Wisconsin/Madison where she was awarded the university's most prestigious chair professorship, the Vilas Research Chair. Today she is a University Professor of the Humanities and professor of history at NYU, teaching courses on gender, social movements, imperialism and the 20th-century US in general. She has won many prestigious awards, including Guggenheim, NEH, ACLS, Radcliffe Institute and the New York Public Library\u00b9s Cullman Center fellowships.     For the first part of her career, most of Gordon's writing examined the historical roots of contemporary social policy debates in the US, particularly as they concern gender and family issues. Her first book, Woman's Body, Woman's Right: The History of Birth Control in America (Viking/Penguin, 1976), published in 1976 and reissued in 1990, remains the definitive history of birth-control politics in the US. It was completely revised and re-published as The Moral Property of Women in 2002. In 1988 she published a historical study of how the US has dealt with family violence, including child abuse, book, spousal violence and sexual abuse. Heroes of Their Own Lives: The History and Politics of Family Violence (Viking/Penguin, 1988) won the Joan Kelly prize of the American Historical Association. Gordon served on the Departments of Justice/Health and Human Services Advisory Council on Violence Against Women for the Clinton administration (a council abolished by the Bush administration). Her history of welfare, Pitied But Not Entitled: Single Mothers and the History of Welfare (Free Press, 1994), won the Berkshire Prize and the Gustavus Myers Human Rights Award.     Changing direction, Gordon turned to narrative as a way of bringing large-scale historical developments to life. Her 1999 book, The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction, the story of a vigilante action against Mexican-Americans, won the Bancroft prize for best book in American history and the Beveridge prize for best book on the history of the Western Hemisphere. In the process of researching her most recent book, she discovered an important group of Lange photographs long unnoticed and never published: photographs of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, commissioned by the US Army but then impounded because they were too critical of the internment policy. Gordon selected 119 of this images and published them in 2006, with introductory essays by herself and by historian Gary Okihiro, as Impounded: Dorothea Lange and Japanese Americans in World War II.

University                                  NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             Department of History     Arts &amp; Science                      Back to Home       The Major in History   Declaration Information:    You may turn in a  major declaration form to the History Department (King Juan Carlos Center - 53 Washington Square South, Floor 4E). You may also submit the form via email to history.undergrad@nyu.edu .    Requirements for the History Major:       A minimum of 36 points in history (typically 9 courses) with the grade of C or better in each course. (No pass/fail courses may count towards the Major or Minor.) History 101 (HIST-UA 101)    At least 6 advanced-level history courses (course # HIST-UA 100 or above).    2 courses in each of the three geographic areas: US, European &amp; Non-Western. 1 course in each geographic area must be an advanced-level course .      1 Capstone Seminar    1 pre-1800 course    Important Guidelines:    History 101 (HIST-UA 101) Historical Interpretation         This course introduces majors to the core skills, methods, and approaches of the discipline. Beginning from Fall 2014, it now teaches this key disciplinary content, such as reading primary sources and analyzing historical arguments, through a series of case studies related to a particular theme (ie: revolutions, warfare, slavery, capitalism, etc). The goal of History 101 is to prepare our majors to succeed in more advanced seminars, including, eventually, a Capstone Seminar. History 101 will consist of both a lecture which will meet twice a week for 75 minutes; and a recitation section which will meet for 75 minutes per week.    History 101 must be taken before a Capstone Seminar in history. Students may not take HIST-UA 101 concurrent with the Capstone Seminar.    History 101 CANNOT fulfill the Geographic, seminar or pre-1800 requirements.    Transferred courses never count toward this requirement.    Introductory Courses (Below HIST-UA 100)       12 of the 36 points (3 classes) may be in introductory courses.    Introductory Courses, usually broad and general, are useful to prepare students for courses that treat subjects in more depth and detail.    Advanced Courses (HIST-UA 100 &amp; above)       All 36 points of the history major may be in advanced courses, but 24 of the 36 points (6 classes) must be in advanced courses.    Advanced courses examine themes or narrower subjects, usually over shorter periods of time, in greater depth and detail than introductory courses. Many of these courses have limited enrollments and require access codes before a student can register for them.    History 101 counts as advanced in terms of requirements.    Geographic Requirements (1 advanced course required in each area)       2 US History Courses    2 European History Courses (Eastern / Western Europe &amp; Russia)    2 Non-Western History Courses (Africa, Asia, Latin America &amp; Middle East)    Capstone Seminar (course number in the 400 range)       One Capstone Seminar is required for the history major. Students must have taken History 101 (HIST-UA 101) and be at least second-semester sophomores to enroll in a Capstone Seminar.    Seminars are designed to offer students an opportunity to discuss a series of topics or issues around a table in an intimate setting of fewer than twenty students and a faculty director. Each student is expected to undertake a research project and make an oral presentation in class about some or all aspects of the project. The professor and fellow students critique one another's work-in-progress and offer helpful suggestions and insights of their own.    At the end of the semester, the student will submit a final paper to the professor who will then assess a grade based on the quality of the paper as well as class participation throughout the semester. This is not a lecture course and normally there are no mid-term or final examinations.    The Capstone Seminar can double count towards the geographic or pre-1800 requirements, as long as the student takes 9 courses total.    Freshman Honors seminars and other seminars below HIST-UA 100 are not considered advanced-level seminars. Advanced Honors Seminars (V28, NOT V70) taught by History professors can fulfill the Capstone Seminar requirement if taken before Fall 2010.    AP Credits       For Majors, we will allow up to 4 points of AP credit provided you achieved a score of 4 or better as one INTRO history course. ( AP credit is not accepted for the minor.)    Transfer Classes       After the credits are accepted by CAS , they must be evaluated by the Assistant to the DUGS or the DUGS. A transfer student must take at least 7 history courses (28 points) in our department. 2 outside courses can be approved through the course petition process to be counted toward the major (see below).    Courses Outside of the History Department       Courses cross-listed with the history department and HIST-UA courses taken during study abroad will count towards the history major. Due to the large number of cross-listed courses if a student enrolled in a cross-listed class under the other department\u2019s course number it is the student\u2019s responsibility to prove that the course has been cross-listed (supply a syllabus or tell us the corresponding HIST-UA number).    Courses that are not cross-listed with the history department must be approved by the DUGS. Students can petition for up to two courses to count towards their major by turning in a course petition form and attached syllabus to the History Department. No course is guaranteed.    CORE (formerly MAP) Courses and Freshman Honors Seminars       CORE/MAP courses (CORE-UA &amp; MAP-UA) and Freshman Honors Seminars (FRSEM-UA) can only count towards the history major if they are taught by a history professor .    CORE/MAP courses (CORE-UA &amp; MAP-UA) and Freshman Honors Seminars (FRSEM-UA) can only count as introductory courses.    LSP Courses       If the major was declared BEFORE SEPTEMBER 2010, students may use three LSP courses towards their history major, Social Foundations I &amp; II and a Non-West Civilization course. These three courses will always be counted as introductory courses. The remaining 6 history classes must be advanced (HIST-UA 100 or above).    If the major was declared September 2010 or later, only two LSP may be counted toward the major: Social Foundations I and II. Students must take 6 advanced courses so only one more introductory course (below HIST-UA 100) course may be counted toward the major.    LSP students who entered CAS beginning Spring 2009 have their LSP courses averaged - indexed -in to their overall cumulative CAS GPA and into the major GPA if you count an LSP course for the history major. Students who entered CAS prior to Spring 2009 do not have their courses in LSP average in these two CAS averages.    Double Counting of Courses       Up to 2 courses may be double counted between the history major and another major or minor.    Internships (HIST-UA 980/981)       Students who wish to engage in history related work in an agency or institute within or outside New York University (ie. UN agency, an archive, museum or library, philanthropy, a publishing house or an appropriate television program) may apply to the DUGS for 2 or 4 points of course elective credit. Applications are available from the History office or on the website.    Interns must devote a minimum of 8 hours a week for a 4 points internship.    Internships may not be used towards satisfying the field distribution requirements but are considered as advanced history electives.    Students interested in an internship for credit must write a 250-word proposal on the nature of their internship and describe why it is historically relevant. They must submit this proposal with a letter from their internship supervisor confirming the internship and stating that they will give the student a proposed grade at the end of the semester.    The student should maintain a daily log during the internship and must submit an 8 \u2013 10 page paper at the end of the semester which can be a compilation of these daily logs or a more traditional thematic paper focusing on what was learned during the internship.    Independent Study (HIST-UA 997/998)       Independent Studies may count towards the major if they are classified as HIST-UA and do not exceed a total of 8 points. They may also be used towards satisfying the field distribution requirement upon formal approval from the DUGS. Such courses, however, cannot be counted towards satisfaction of History 101 or the Capstone Seminar.    Students interested in undertaking independent study on a specific or specialized topic of their choice may do so by applying to the DUGS for 2 or 4 points of course credit. Applications are available from the History office or on the website.    The student will indicate a general area of interest and will need to obtain the agreement of a faculty supervisor. The student and faculty supervisor must consult each other on a regular basis, at least biweekly, and the grade for the course must be submitted by the supervisor to the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the last week of the term in which the student is registered.    Graduate Classes (HIST-GA)       Undergraduate seniors with a history GPA of 3.5 or better may take some graduate level history courses. Consult the current course schedule and then seek permission to register from the instructor of the course and the DUGS. In a few cases, a graduate course involving a research paper may be used to fulfill the Capstone Seminar requirement.
