To that end, the group will consult broadly with faculty, students, and other members of the NYU community, as well as external leaders in educational innovation.   Among the questions that the group should address are:       how can we best provide support to faculty who choose to use instructional technology to enhance the quality and effectiveness of their teaching;   how can instructional technology be used to create a more dynamic and effective environment for teaching and learning that is beneficial to all members of the educational community;   how can instructional technology enrich learning communities within and across NYU\u2019s global network (e.g., by developing platforms and pathways for collaboration and experimentation);   whether and how might the University use technology-assisted courses to engage new constituencies;   what impact might new instructional technologies have on the flow of revenue;   how might the application of new technologies be used to address the question of access to higher education; and   how can and should the application of new instructional technologies (including formative and summative techniques of evaluation) be used to assess best practices in teaching and learning?     On the basis of these conversations, the group will prepare a written report for the University\u2019s Teaching Technology Committee, which will disseminate it widely for consideration across various units of the University and will then prepare a final recommendation to the President and Provost.              Membership   The Committee includes representatives from nearly every NYU school, as well as from the Faculty Senators Council.

Coles Site Redevelopment   Guided by the recommendations of the University Space Priorities Working Group, NYU is moving forward with the redevelopment of the Coles Sports and Recreation Center as a new, mixed-use building to include classrooms, academic spaces for the performing arts, an athletic center, and housing for students and faculty.

To that end, the group will consult broadly with faculty, students, and other members of the NYU community, as well as external leaders in educational innovation.   Among the questions that the group should address are:       how can we best provide support to faculty who choose to use instructional technology to enhance the quality and effectiveness of their teaching;   how can instructional technology be used to create a more dynamic and effective environment for teaching and learning that is beneficial to all members of the educational community;   how can instructional technology enrich learning communities within and across NYU\u2019s global network (e.g., by developing platforms and pathways for collaboration and experimentation);   whether and how might the University use technology-assisted courses to engage new constituencies;   what impact might new instructional technologies have on the flow of revenue;   how might the application of new technologies be used to address the question of access to higher education; and   how can and should the application of new instructional technologies (including formative and summative techniques of evaluation) be used to assess best practices in teaching and learning?     On the basis of these conversations, the group will prepare a written report for the University\u2019s Teaching Technology Committee, which will disseminate it widely for consideration across various units of the University and will then prepare a final recommendation to the President and Provost.              Membership   The Committee includes representatives from nearly every NYU school, as well as from the Faculty Senators Council.

To that end, the group will consult broadly with faculty, students, and other members of the NYU community, as well as external leaders in educational innovation.   Among the questions that the group should address are:       how can we best provide support to faculty who choose to use instructional technology to enhance the quality and effectiveness of their teaching;   how can instructional technology be used to create a more dynamic and effective environment for teaching and learning that is beneficial to all members of the educational community;   how can instructional technology enrich learning communities within and across NYU\u2019s global network (e.g., by developing platforms and pathways for collaboration and experimentation);   whether and how might the University use technology-assisted courses to engage new constituencies;   what impact might new instructional technologies have on the flow of revenue;   how might the application of new technologies be used to address the question of access to higher education; and   how can and should the application of new instructional technologies (including formative and summative techniques of evaluation) be used to assess best practices in teaching and learning?     On the basis of these conversations, the group will prepare a written report for the University\u2019s Teaching Technology Committee, which will disseminate it widely for consideration across various units of the University and will then prepare a final recommendation to the President and Provost.              Membership   The Committee includes representatives from nearly every NYU school, as well as from the Faculty Senators Council.

Delivered in partnership with the NYU Leadership Initiative, this program leverages the unique resources of NYU Washington, DC to create a cadre of globally prepared young leaders from around the world.                                             The NYU Leadership Initiative strives to inspire and develop a lifelong practice of ethical and inclusive leadership.

Universities are among the most enduring of human institutions. They owe their longevity, in part, to their ability to reflect upon long range goals and their tradition of carefully and successfully balancing present considerations with future concerns.    As part of its long-range planning, NYU has embarked on a series of undertakings that reflect its priorities as an institution. These initiatives will shape the University in ways that will permit following generations of scholars, students, administrators, and staff to carry the University further still.

To that end, the group will consult broadly with faculty, students, and other members of the NYU community, as well as external leaders in educational innovation.   Among the questions that the group should address are:       how can we best provide support to faculty who choose to use instructional technology to enhance the quality and effectiveness of their teaching;   how can instructional technology be used to create a more dynamic and effective environment for teaching and learning that is beneficial to all members of the educational community;   how can instructional technology enrich learning communities within and across NYU\u2019s global network (e.g., by developing platforms and pathways for collaboration and experimentation);   whether and how might the University use technology-assisted courses to engage new constituencies;   what impact might new instructional technologies have on the flow of revenue;   how might the application of new technologies be used to address the question of access to higher education; and   how can and should the application of new instructional technologies (including formative and summative techniques of evaluation) be used to assess best practices in teaching and learning?     On the basis of these conversations, the group will prepare a written report for the University\u2019s Teaching Technology Committee, which will disseminate it widely for consideration across various units of the University and will then prepare a final recommendation to the President and Provost.              Membership   The Committee includes representatives from nearly every NYU school, as well as from the Faculty Senators Council.

Universities are among the most enduring of human institutions. They owe their longevity, in part, to their ability to reflect upon long range goals and their tradition of carefully and successfully balancing present considerations with future concerns.    As part of its long-range planning, NYU has embarked on a series of undertakings that reflect its priorities as an institution. These initiatives will shape the University in ways that will permit following generations of scholars, students, administrators, and staff to carry the University further still.
