Description       Science is today one of the most powerful ways to understand the world. But there was a time when all the foundations of modern science\u2014experiments, theories, mathematics, scientific instruments\u2014were considered radical, unreliable, and unjustified. The period when these foundations came to be accepted is known as the Scientific Revolution. This was the era of Copernicus, Newton, and Galileo pioneering dramatically new ways of thinking about the universe and humanity\u2019s place in it, and this course explores how these new ways came to be accepted. We will look at not just the great achievements of the Scientific Revolution, but also how those achievements were crucially interdependent on the contemporary context of society, politics, religion, printing, and art. We will discuss why science appeared when and where it did, how science impacted society, and how we can retain the power of science while also acknowledging that it is fundamentally a human enterprise. Readings include works by Aristotle, Copernicus, Descartes, Boyle, Vesalius, William Harvey, Francis Bacon, Galileo, Pascal, Newton, and Leibniz, as well as selections from Shapin and Schaffer\u2019s\u00a0 Leviathan and the Air Pump \u00a0, Daston and Park\u2019s\u00a0 Wonders and the Order of Nature \u00a0, and Ginzburg\u2019s\u00a0 The Cheese and the Worms \u00a0.
