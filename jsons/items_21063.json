As most students enter the program with little or no experience in film or video, early assignments familiarize them with equipment and introduce documentary, experimental, and narrative approaches. Working in crews, students develop their directing, shooting, and editing skills as they produce music videos and short videos (three to five minutes in length). Special emphasis is placed on storytelling through visual language. Students learn the basics of screenwriting through free-writing exercises and reading assignments as well as the script development of their short films. Lectures, seminars, and screenings highlight the fundamentals of story structure, character development, communication of thematic statements, and visual storytelling, among other topics. In addition, screenings of significant works and discussions with industry professionals and Tisch faculty are held. Daily sessions are divided into lecture, lab, and screening periods.

Intermediate Narrative Production Workshop is a practical course in which students (collaborating in crews of four) are exposed to a broad range of production techniques through production experience and class discussion. Each group produces four color sync-sound exercises during the semester that explore craft, aesthetic, production and storytelling issues. As a group member, each student will serve in rotation as director, producer, camera, sound, and AC/gaffer. Students are encouraged to edit their work in the Intermediate Edit Workshop (H56.1018) the following semester.    Important note: students should enter Intermediate Narrative Production Workshop with a short (i.e., 3-5 pages, but no more than 8) script. The production work in this course is strenuous. Students should be conscious of this when designing their semester schedules.
