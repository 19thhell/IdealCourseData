NYU offers several options to study applied statistics and data science. See the Data Science website for a list of closely related master&rsquo;s programs.    What is the deadline for applying to the Master of Science in Applied Statistics for Social Science Research (A3SR)? February 1 for September matriculation. Late applications will be accepted on a space available basis.    What are the qualifications for admissions? In addition to a strong academic record and GRE scores, applicants should have majored or minored in a quantitative discipline that provides a solid foundation for advanced study of applied statistics or completed a selection of courses typically found in such quantitative disciplines.    The three programs that are most closely related are:       Mathematics, which emphasizes formal reasoning and modeling (e.g., advanced calculus, logic, linear algebra, probability theory)    Statistics (e.g., inference and probability, linear models)    Computer science (e.g., programming, discrete math, analysis of algorithms, data mining techniques).       These are just three potential programs of typical applicants; we strongly encourage individuals who major or minor in another quantitatively rigorous discipline such as economics, the physical sciences, or computational biology to apply, if their skills and interests align with the above.    Are there different admissions requirements for international students? Yes, for applicants whose native languaue is not English and who did not receive a bachelor's degree at an English-speaking college or university, the TOEFL is mandatory. Additionally, international students who are offered admission will be required to take the English Proficiency Exam at NYU's American Language Institute (ALI) prior to their arrival at NYU. Full-time enrollment in the program is conditional upon the results of the ALI examination. Detailed Special Instructions for International Applicants are available in the Graduate Admissions Guide.    How many credits is the program? This is a variable 34-47 credit program.    How will I know if I can accelerate the program? The required credits for a student with no prior related coursework is 47. Students will have the opportunity to decrease their number of credits during the advisement process, prior to the start of the first semester. Students will also be asked to complete assessments in relevant topics/fields. In some circumstances other types of criteria (published papers, software packages, etc.) will be used to assess mastery of a topic. How long does it take to complete the MS program? This is a variable 34-47 credit program. The full-time program can be completed in 3 or 4 semesters, depending on your prior statistical training. Part-time enrollment is permitted and will, of course, take longer -- up to 6 semesters.    What are the components of the admission application?       Online application form    Application fee    Resume    Statement of Purpose    All college transcripts    Two letters of recommendation    GRE scores    1 page supplemental statement on your statistical, mathematical, or computer science background       For more information on the application process, please refer to the Graduate Application Guide . Is the GRE required? Yes, the GRE is required for the M.S. program. Do I need to submit letters of recommendation? Yes, please submit two letters from professors or former employers from the last five years. These should speak to your proven abilities in statistics, mathematics, or computer science as well as your professional interests and promise as a student and researcher. What supplementary materials are required in the application? A one page supplemented statement on your statistical, mathematical, or computer science background. Please describe any courses you have taken as an undergraduate or graduate student or any work experience you have in these fields. Is an interview required for admission? No, an interview is not required for admission.    Where do I send supplementary materials, such as letters of recommendation and transcripts? All admissions materials, including letters of recommendation, transcripts, and the supplemental one-page statement, are submitted through the online application . If you have additional questions regarding the online application system, please contact Graduate Admissions at steinhardt.gradadmissions@nyu.edu. What are the TOEFL requirements? Successful candidates have scored at or above 100 on the internet-based exam. What is the GPA requirement? Our review of candidates for admission is holistic; we consider all components of the application when making admission decisions. Successful candidates for admission will demonstrate a strong record of academic achievement either at the undergraduate level or from previous graduate level coursework from accredited institutions. I do not have a statistics, mathematics, or computer science background - am I still eligible to apply to this program? Yes. Although the program is designed for students with some statistical and data analysis skills, it is possible for candidates from other quantitative backgrounds to gain admission to the program. Under those circumstances, a higher number of credits are likely to be required to complete the program. How do I know if this is the right program for me? This M.S. program is a good choice if you like to work with numbers and solving problems, want to sharpen your data-analysis and analytical skills, learn advanced statistical methods and use them to solve important problems and inform policy or practice in any number of applied fields. The program is designed to help you develop and improve your ability to perform and understand complex quantitative research in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Are you looking for students with life experience or for those who have recently completed an undergraduate degree? We welcome students who are recent college graduates as well as those who have worked in a related field or are interested in changing the direction of their professional career.    What is the cost of tuition for this program? Students may complete the program on a full- or part-time basis. Current rates for tuition and fees are posted here . These charges are assessed on a per-credit basis. Expect tuition and fees to increase annually by 3-5%. You'll also find estimated expenses for housing, books and supplies, transportation, and health insurance. The Graduate Admissions site offers detailed information on applying for scholarships and other forms of financial aid. Are scholarships available? Yes. Information on scholarships is listed on the Steinhardt Graduate Admissions website under financial aid . All applicants who are interested in being considered for school-based scholarships MUST complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by going to www.fafsa.ed.gov and submitting it electronically to NYU. Detailed instructions can be found on the Graduate Admissions financial aid web pages. The deadline for submitting the FAFSA to NYU is February 1. Please note that the earliest time you can access the form is January 1. Do you offer scholarships for part-time students? NYU Steinhardt is committed to assisting graduate applicants in the process of financing their education. One way we do this is by offering partial tuition scholarships (such as the Centennial Scholarship for new part-time master's students), fellowships, and assistantships that are based on merit and financial need. Fellowships and assistantships, however, are comparatively uncommon for part-time students. Other forms of aid, such as loans, college work-study, and student employment can help part-time students complete their advanced degrees. For more information, visit our financial aid website. Is funding available for international students? NYU Steinhardt encourages international applicants to investigate scholarship support offered by their home country to support their studies at NYU. Master's and advanced certificate applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents and eligible for federal financial aid may receive consideration for school-based financial aid. Non-U.S. citizens may be eligible for non-NYU sources of funding. NYU provides a list of external Scholarship Search Services that may be helpful in researching funding. Can I transfer credits from other institutions and have them count toward the required number of credits for this program/waive any course requirements/get credit for past coursework? You may not transfer credits from other institutions and have them count toward the M.S. degree, however, course requirements may be waived based on the applicant's undergraduate coursework and at the discretion of advisors in the Applied Statistics for Social Science Research program. Waiving will decrease the number of credits needed to complete the program and will allow students greater flexibility in pursuing coursework relevant to their specific interests. What kind of housing do you provide? On-campus housing at NYU is limited. Most graduate students live off-campus. Graduate Admissions serves as the liaison office to NYU Housing so general questions about the process may be directed to them. Learn more about on and off-campus housing . When will I receive a decision from NYU? Decisions are typically emailed out from Graduate Admissions beginning in late March and early April for Fall applications.  I live overseas and snail mail is inconsistent. Can the admissions decision be emailed to me? Yes, all admissions decisions are sent via email. I am planning to visit campus and would like to attend a class. When is the best time for me to do this? Our schedule of courses is posted online each semester. If you would like to attend a class, please email us at steinhardt.a3sr@nyu.edu. When can I attend an information session? Online and in-person information sessions are hosted throughout the fall and spring semesters. For information session dates, click here . I cannot attend the information session. Can I still meet with an advisor or faculty member to discuss the program? Yes, send an email to steinhardt.a3sr@nyu.edu to request a phone or in-person appointment with an advisor or faculty member. You can also join one of our online information sessions. Can you mail an information packet on the program to my home address? We do not send materials via mail. Detailed information about the M.S. degree can be found on this web site, including course requirements and faculty biographies. After reviewing the website, if you have additional questions, please email steinhardt.a3sr@nyu.edu. To receive general updates about NYU Steinhardt, join our monthly eNewsletter mailing list using our online inquiry form . eNews provides you with the latest information on special events, program developments, faculty research, financial aid opportunities and deadlines. How many students are enrolled in the M.S. program? We expect to have 10-15 students in each class. Can I work full time and still take classes? While it is possible to work full time and still take classes it is not recommended to do so with a full-time course load. Moreover it would require a flexible work schedule since classes are typically not offered in the evenings and are never offered on the weekends. Are all courses offered each semester? Not all courses will be offered each semester. Courses are scheduled, however, such that full-time and part-time students will be able to complete the program in a timely fashion. Do you offer online courses? We do not currently or plan to offer courses online. We understand that this is an attractive option to many, and we may consider it in the future. Do you offer summer courses? We do not offer exclusively summer graduate programs, but some of the elective courses offered in other departments are often offered in summer. With careful planning in conjunction with their advisor, students could fulfill certain program requirements during the summers. Does the program provide opportunities for internships or other types of hands-on experience? Candidates for this degree are expected to either participate in an internship with an approved business or organization or to participate in a research project with a faculty mentor.  Do you offer job placement assistance after graduation? NYU's Wasserman Career Center provides assistance to all graduate students and alumni from NYU Steinhardt. In addition, the A3SR program page will be periodically updated with relevant career-related resources, and students can consult with program advisors about career matters.

These are just three potential programs of typical applicants; we strongly encourage individuals who major or minor in another quantitatively rigorous discipline such as economics, the physical sciences, or computational biology to apply, if their skills and interests align with the above.    Are there different admissions requirements for international students? Yes, for applicants whose native languaue is not English and who did not receive a bachelor's degree at an English-speaking college or university, the TOEFL is mandatory. Additionally, international students who are offered admission will be required to take the English Proficiency Exam at NYU's American Language Institute (ALI) prior to their arrival at NYU. Full-time enrollment in the program is conditional upon the results of the ALI examination. Detailed Special Instructions for International Applicants are available in the Graduate Admissions Guide.    How many credits is the program? This is a variable 34-47 credit program.    How will I know if I can accelerate the program? The required credits for a student with no prior related coursework is 47. Students will have the opportunity to decrease their number of credits during the advisement process, prior to the start of the first semester. Students will also be asked to complete assessments in relevant topics/fields. In some circumstances other types of criteria (published papers, software packages, etc.) will be used to assess mastery of a topic. How long does it take to complete the MS program? This is a variable 34-47 credit program. The full-time program can be completed in 3 or 4 semesters, depending on your prior statistical training. Part-time enrollment is permitted and will, of course, take longer -- up to 6 semesters.    What are the components of the admission application?       Online application form    Application fee    Resume    Statement of Purpose    All college transcripts    Two letters of recommendation    GRE scores    1 page supplemental statement on your statistical, mathematical, or computer science background       For more information on the application process, please refer to the Graduate Application Guide . Is the GRE required? Yes, the GRE is required for the M.S. program. Do I need to submit letters of recommendation? Yes, please submit two letters from professors or former employers from the last five years. These should speak to your proven abilities in statistics, mathematics, or computer science as well as your professional interests and promise as a student and researcher. What supplementary materials are required in the application? A one page supplemented statement on your statistical, mathematical, or computer science background. Please describe any courses you have taken as an undergraduate or graduate student or any work experience you have in these fields. Is an interview required for admission? No, an interview is not required for admission.    Where do I send supplementary materials, such as letters of recommendation and transcripts? All admissions materials, including letters of recommendation, transcripts, and the supplemental one-page statement, are submitted through the online application . If you have additional questions regarding the online application system, please contact Graduate Admissions at steinhardt.gradadmissions@nyu.edu. What are the TOEFL requirements? Successful candidates have scored at or above 100 on the internet-based exam. What is the GPA requirement? Our review of candidates for admission is holistic; we consider all components of the application when making admission decisions. Successful candidates for admission will demonstrate a strong record of academic achievement either at the undergraduate level or from previous graduate level coursework from accredited institutions. I do not have a statistics, mathematics, or computer science background - am I still eligible to apply to this program? Yes. Although the program is designed for students with some statistical and data analysis skills, it is possible for candidates from other quantitative backgrounds to gain admission to the program. Under those circumstances, a higher number of credits are likely to be required to complete the program. How do I know if this is the right program for me? This M.S. program is a good choice if you like to work with numbers and solving problems, want to sharpen your data-analysis and analytical skills, learn advanced statistical methods and use them to solve important problems and inform policy or practice in any number of applied fields. The program is designed to help you develop and improve your ability to perform and understand complex quantitative research in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Are you looking for students with life experience or for those who have recently completed an undergraduate degree? We welcome students who are recent college graduates as well as those who have worked in a related field or are interested in changing the direction of their professional career.    What is the cost of tuition for this program? Students may complete the program on a full- or part-time basis. Current rates for tuition and fees are posted here . These charges are assessed on a per-credit basis. Expect tuition and fees to increase annually by 3-5%. You'll also find estimated expenses for housing, books and supplies, transportation, and health insurance. The Graduate Admissions site offers detailed information on applying for scholarships and other forms of financial aid. Are scholarships available? Yes. Information on scholarships is listed on the Steinhardt Graduate Admissions website under financial aid . All applicants who are interested in being considered for school-based scholarships MUST complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by going to www.fafsa.ed.gov and submitting it electronically to NYU. Detailed instructions can be found on the Graduate Admissions financial aid web pages. The deadline for submitting the FAFSA to NYU is February 1. Please note that the earliest time you can access the form is January 1. Do you offer scholarships for part-time students? NYU Steinhardt is committed to assisting graduate applicants in the process of financing their education. One way we do this is by offering partial tuition scholarships (such as the Centennial Scholarship for new part-time master's students), fellowships, and assistantships that are based on merit and financial need. Fellowships and assistantships, however, are comparatively uncommon for part-time students. Other forms of aid, such as loans, college work-study, and student employment can help part-time students complete their advanced degrees. For more information, visit our financial aid website. Is funding available for international students? NYU Steinhardt encourages international applicants to investigate scholarship support offered by their home country to support their studies at NYU. Master's and advanced certificate applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents and eligible for federal financial aid may receive consideration for school-based financial aid. Non-U.S. citizens may be eligible for non-NYU sources of funding. NYU provides a list of external Scholarship Search Services that may be helpful in researching funding. Can I transfer credits from other institutions and have them count toward the required number of credits for this program/waive any course requirements/get credit for past coursework? You may not transfer credits from other institutions and have them count toward the M.S. degree, however, course requirements may be waived based on the applicant's undergraduate coursework and at the discretion of advisors in the Applied Statistics for Social Science Research program. Waiving will decrease the number of credits needed to complete the program and will allow students greater flexibility in pursuing coursework relevant to their specific interests. What kind of housing do you provide? On-campus housing at NYU is limited. Most graduate students live off-campus. Graduate Admissions serves as the liaison office to NYU Housing so general questions about the process may be directed to them. Learn more about on and off-campus housing . When will I receive a decision from NYU? Decisions are typically emailed out from Graduate Admissions beginning in late March and early April for Fall applications.  I live overseas and snail mail is inconsistent. Can the admissions decision be emailed to me? Yes, all admissions decisions are sent via email. I am planning to visit campus and would like to attend a class. When is the best time for me to do this? Our schedule of courses is posted online each semester. If you would like to attend a class, please email us at steinhardt.a3sr@nyu.edu. When can I attend an information session? Online and in-person information sessions are hosted throughout the fall and spring semesters. For information session dates, click here . I cannot attend the information session. Can I still meet with an advisor or faculty member to discuss the program? Yes, send an email to steinhardt.a3sr@nyu.edu to request a phone or in-person appointment with an advisor or faculty member. You can also join one of our online information sessions. Can you mail an information packet on the program to my home address? We do not send materials via mail. Detailed information about the M.S. degree can be found on this web site, including course requirements and faculty biographies. After reviewing the website, if you have additional questions, please email steinhardt.a3sr@nyu.edu. To receive general updates about NYU Steinhardt, join our monthly eNewsletter mailing list using our online inquiry form . eNews provides you with the latest information on special events, program developments, faculty research, financial aid opportunities and deadlines. How many students are enrolled in the M.S. program? We expect to have 10-15 students in each class. Can I work full time and still take classes? While it is possible to work full time and still take classes it is not recommended to do so with a full-time course load. Moreover it would require a flexible work schedule since classes are typically not offered in the evenings and are never offered on the weekends. Are all courses offered each semester? Not all courses will be offered each semester. Courses are scheduled, however, such that full-time and part-time students will be able to complete the program in a timely fashion. Do you offer online courses? We do not currently or plan to offer courses online. We understand that this is an attractive option to many, and we may consider it in the future. Do you offer summer courses? We do not offer exclusively summer graduate programs, but some of the elective courses offered in other departments are often offered in summer. With careful planning in conjunction with their advisor, students could fulfill certain program requirements during the summers. Does the program provide opportunities for internships or other types of hands-on experience? Candidates for this degree are expected to either participate in an internship with an approved business or organization or to participate in a research project with a faculty mentor.  Do you offer job placement assistance after graduation? NYU's Wasserman Career Center provides assistance to all graduate students and alumni from NYU Steinhardt.
