It\u2019s used to project the job market for nurses (based on availability of jobs) and can also be considered an indicator of whether a health care organization has a good working environment.     A study in the current issue of Policy, Politics &amp; Nursing Practice reveals that an estimated 17.5 percent of newly-licensed RNs leave their first nursing job within the first year and one in three (33.5%) leave within two years. The researchers found that turnover for this group is lower at hospitals than at other health care settings.     The study, which synthesized existing turnover data and reported turnover data from a nationally representative sample of RNs, was conducted by the RN Work Project, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It is the only longitudinal study of RNs in the United States. The data comes from surveys of three cohorts of newly-licensed RNs conducted since 2006.     Registered nurses (RNs) leaving their jobs (RN turnover) is costly for hospitals and also affects quality of care. Organizational costs associated with RN turnover can be as much as $6.4 million for a large acute care hospital, and studies have associated turnover among health providers with an increase in the use of physical restraints, pressure ulcers and patient falls.     The RN Work Project is directed by Christine T. Kovner, PhD, RN, FAAN, professor at the College of Nursing, New York University (NYU); and Carol Brewer, PhD, RN, FAAN, professor at the School of Nursing, University at Buffalo. Other investigators for this study were Farida Fatehi, MS, BDS, data analyst at New York University; and Jin Jun, MSN, APRN, CCRN, research assistant at also at the College of Nursing at NYU.     The authors point out many of the problems with existing turnover numbers in the literature.     \u201cOne of the biggest problems we face in trying to assess the impact of nurse turnover on our health care system as a whole is that there\u2019s not a single, agreed-upon definition of turnover,\u201d said Kovner. \u201cIn order to make comparisons across organizations and geographical areas, researchers, policy makers and others need valid and reliable data based on consistent definitions of turnover. It makes sense to look at RNs across multiple organizations, as we did, rather than in a single organization or type of organization to get an accurate picture of RN turnover.\u201d     The research team noted that there are different kinds of turnover, and that in some cases, RN turnover can actually be helpful. In cases of functional turnover, a poorly functioning employee leaves, as opposed to dysfunctional turnover, when well-performing employees leave. Authors recommend that organizations pay attention to the kind of turnover occurring, and point that their data indicate that when most RNs leave their jobs, they go to another health care job.     \u201cDeveloping a standard definition of turnover would go a long way in helping identify the reasons for RN turnover and whether managers should be concerned about their institutions\u2019 turnover rates,\u201d said Brewer. \u201cA high rate of turnover at a hospital, if it\u2019s voluntary, could be problematic, but if it\u2019s involuntary or if nurses are moving within the hospital to another unit or position, that tells a very different story.\u201d     The RN Work Project\u2019s data include all organizational turnover (voluntary and involuntary), but do not include position turnover if the RN stayed at the same health care organization.     The RN Work Project is a 10-year study of NLRNs that began in 2006. It is the only multi-state, longitudinal study of new nurses\u2019 turnover rates, intentions and attitudes\u2014including intent, satisfaction, organizational commitment, and preferences about work. The study draws on data from nurses in 34 states, covering 51 metropolitan areas and nine rural areas.

Dr. Kovner is the principal investigator, and Carol Brewer, RN, Ph.D., of the University of Buffalo School of Nursing, will be a consultant on the study. The study will investigate changes in trends across four cohorts from those RNs who have graduated since 2004-05.   \u201cWe think the data generated from this new survey will add additional data about new nurses to inform decisions of health care managers, policy makers, and foundations,\u201d said Dr. Kovner.   The results of this survey will be compared with prior cohorts of NLRNs surveyed before implementation of both the Future of Nursing: Campaign for Action (CFA) and the Quality and Safety Education for Nursing (QSEN) programs.   Drs. Kovner and Brewer are the Co-Principal Investigators of the RWJF funded RN Work Project , a national study of new nurses, focusing on career changes and work attitudes that has been tracking NLNRs for the first 10 years of their careers..

It\u2019s used to project the job market for nurses (based on availability of jobs) and can also be considered an indicator of whether a health care organization has a good working environment.     A study in the current issue of Policy, Politics &amp; Nursing Practice reveals that an estimated 17.5 percent of newly-licensed RNs leave their first nursing job within the first year and one in three (33.5%) leave within two years. The researchers found that turnover for this group is lower at hospitals than at other health care settings.     The study, which synthesized existing turnover data and reported turnover data from a nationally representative sample of RNs, was conducted by the RN Work Project, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It is the only longitudinal study of RNs in the United States. The data comes from surveys of three cohorts of newly-licensed RNs conducted since 2006.     Registered nurses (RNs) leaving their jobs (RN turnover) is costly for hospitals and also affects quality of care. Organizational costs associated with RN turnover can be as much as $6.4 million for a large acute care hospital, and studies have associated turnover among health providers with an increase in the use of physical restraints, pressure ulcers and patient falls.     The RN Work Project is directed by Christine T. Kovner, PhD, RN, FAAN, professor at the College of Nursing, New York University (NYU); and Carol Brewer, PhD, RN, FAAN, professor at the School of Nursing, University at Buffalo. Other investigators for this study were Farida Fatehi, MS, BDS, data analyst at New York University; and Jin Jun, MSN, APRN, CCRN, research assistant at also at the College of Nursing at NYU.     The authors point out many of the problems with existing turnover numbers in the literature.     \u201cOne of the biggest problems we face in trying to assess the impact of nurse turnover on our health care system as a whole is that there\u2019s not a single, agreed-upon definition of turnover,\u201d said Kovner. \u201cIn order to make comparisons across organizations and geographical areas, researchers, policy makers and others need valid and reliable data based on consistent definitions of turnover. It makes sense to look at RNs across multiple organizations, as we did, rather than in a single organization or type of organization to get an accurate picture of RN turnover.\u201d     The research team noted that there are different kinds of turnover, and that in some cases, RN turnover can actually be helpful. In cases of functional turnover, a poorly functioning employee leaves, as opposed to dysfunctional turnover, when well-performing employees leave. Authors recommend that organizations pay attention to the kind of turnover occurring, and point that their data indicate that when most RNs leave their jobs, they go to another health care job.     \u201cDeveloping a standard definition of turnover would go a long way in helping identify the reasons for RN turnover and whether managers should be concerned about their institutions\u2019 turnover rates,\u201d said Brewer. \u201cA high rate of turnover at a hospital, if it\u2019s voluntary, could be problematic, but if it\u2019s involuntary or if nurses are moving within the hospital to another unit or position, that tells a very different story.\u201d     The RN Work Project\u2019s data include all organizational turnover (voluntary and involuntary), but do not include position turnover if the RN stayed at the same health care organization.     The RN Work Project is a 10-year study of NLRNs that began in 2006. It is the only multi-state, longitudinal study of new nurses\u2019 turnover rates, intentions and attitudes\u2014including intent, satisfaction, organizational commitment, and preferences about work. The study draws on data from nurses in 34 states, covering 51 metropolitan areas and nine rural areas.

The study will investigate changes in trends across four cohorts from those RNs who have graduated since 2004-05.   \u201cWe think the data generated from this new survey will add additional data about new nurses to inform decisions of health care managers, policy makers, and foundations,\u201d said Dr. Kovner.   The results of this survey will be compared with prior cohorts of NLRNs surveyed before implementation of both the Future of Nursing: Campaign for Action (CFA) and the Quality and Safety Education for Nursing (QSEN) programs.   Drs. Kovner and Brewer are the Co-Principal Investigators of the RWJF funded RN Work Project , a national study of new nurses, focusing on career changes and work attitudes that has been tracking NLNRs for the first 10 years of their careers..
