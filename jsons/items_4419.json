Bagnall and Potts (Institute for the Study of the Ancient World)  syllabus * For centuries the Indian Ocean basin has been a conduit for a variety of cultural encounters and transfers between South Asia, Arabia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. The sea routes through the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, down the coast of East Africa, and across the Indian Ocean, have been the maritime counterpart to the complex of land routes often called collectively the \"Silk Road.\" They were trade routes, certainly; but the civilizations in this vast expanse were also connected by military action, diplomacy, the diffusion of religion and artistic currents, and many more interconnections. We look at the many facets that characterize the resulting network, involving the whole area from the Mediterranean to South Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the earliest European involvement in the region. The approach is multi-disciplinary throughout, as we consider a variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts, and how these different kinds of evidence contribute in the scholarly reconstruction of an early globalized world. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 500, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Civil War and Its Aftermath in 20th Century Spain Prof. Labanyi (Spanish and Portuguese)  syllabus*  The   Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 has been called the last war fought for   utopian ideals; it was also the first war to see mass bombing of   civilian targets, and was internationalization as a fight between   Fascism and Communism, thanks to support for the right-wing military   uprising by Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, and support for the   left-wing Republican Government by the Soviet Union and international   volunteers from across the globe. While World War II ended with the   defeat of fascism, Spain\u2019s Civil War ended with fascism\u2019s triumph and   the institution of a dictatorship, under General Franco, that lasted   almost 40 years, during which the winners of the war were ritually   remembered, while the losers suffered savage reprisals and could not be   mentioned in public. After his death in 1975, feelings about the war   were still so strong that the topic was avoided, to ensure a peaceful   transition to democracy; but since the mid-1990s, the topic has surfaced   in often acrimonious public debate and a proliferation of cultural   representations, as Spain tries to come to terms with the wounds of a   civil conflict only now starting to be addressed. We explore the   political issues involved in the Spanish Civil War and its remembrance   today, considering a wide range of materials, including letters from the   front by U.S. volunteers held in the archive of the Abraham Lincoln   Brigade here at NYU, Picasso\u2019s Guernica, and historical and contemporary   films, and raising issues about the politics of memory, trauma,   post-memory, and national reconciliation.  FALL 2015 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus * The   South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary   globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population   experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of   massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption   and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality,   and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet   central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media   industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy   as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to   social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides   entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television,   internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for   understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship   between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated   religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (Russian &amp; Slavic Studies/History)  syllabus * Focuses   on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in   Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary   works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all   periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing   positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus * The   people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an   ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual   state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel,   when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older   origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of   reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing   projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 525, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America and the Caribbean Profs. Ferrer and Thomson (History)  syllabus* A general introduction to the history and culture of Latin America, focusing on major themes in the history of the region: colonization and interaction between Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people; the Atlantic slave trade and the creation of slave and plantation societies; race, nationalism, and revolution; and the place of the United States and Africa in the region. Readings include Spanish and indigenous accounts of the Conquest, firsthand accounts of the slave trade, revolutionary manifestos, political cartoons, and a range of other sources. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus * Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus * Major   issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to   contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a   formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical   context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which   they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions   concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers   of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the   problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion   of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times   parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the   politics of translation into European modalities. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus* Modern   Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population,   Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its   ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins   of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and   the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli   society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular   state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system,   the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the   role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a   survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of   all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in   the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli   society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international   limelight. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Tu (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)   syllabus * Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization, among others. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. As an expression/reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts, we pay particular attention to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions--films, literature, art, media, and popular culture. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 543, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Korea [Staff] (East Asian Studies)  syllabus A multi-disciplinary introduction to Korean society and culture, surveying Korean history from antiquity to the present though a wide range of primary sources from the past, including archaeological relics, written records, and works of art, as well as contemporary materials by Korean authors, directors, and other cultural producers. Considers the origins of Korean \u201ctradition,\u201d the formation and development of social relations, popular beliefs, and systems of thought that have shaped the Korean way of life, in order to locate their resonances and ramifications in modern Korea, particularly in cultural representations. Continues with Korea\u2019s \u201ctransformation\u201d through its encounter with the West, its modern experiences and national struggle under colonial rule, social upheavals after liberation, and the Korean War. Concludes by tracing the enduring impacts of the unresolved past on contemporary society, Korea \u201ctoday\u201d in terms of economic development and crisis, the democracy movement and its limitations, relations with North Korea and with the US, and sociocultural diversification in the age of globalization. To forge critical perspectives on Korean history, society, and culture, students are encouraged to situate these topics within the broader contexts of East Asia and the world. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus * Spanish   modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a   major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and   successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a   conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and   feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for   anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity,   Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber   rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven   centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth   of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a   human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the   novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy,   the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian   princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492,   Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial   expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern,   disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property,   and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and   theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the   late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America)   kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing   fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the   Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of   Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s   current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include   history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 556, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Germany Prof. Wood (German)  syllabus* An introduction to the achievements and paradoxes of modern German history and culture. Crucial historical background is the invention of the printing press by Johann Gutenberg in the 1450s, the Protestant Reformation catalyzed by Martin Luther in 1517, and the Thirty Years\u2019 War of the seventeenth century, but the emphasis is on the shaping role that German art and thought have played within European modernity from the late eighteenth century to the present, culminating in the regeneration of German literature and art since the 1960s, involving such figures as Heinrich B\u00f6ll, Christa Wolf, Alexander Kluge, Ingeborg Bachmann, W.G. Sebald, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Josef Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, and Martin Kippenberger. Sources include literary, philosophical, and other texts, and works of art, architecture, music, and film.   Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus Spring 2016 SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 500, Cultures and Contexts: Topics\u2014Transnational Asia Prof. Koyagi (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) Where is \u201cAsia\u201d? What does \u201cAsia\u201d mean? Your answers to these questions would probably be very different from answers that an Iranian intellectual from ninety years ago would have given. Or an Indian poet from 150 years ago. Or a Japanese writer from 400 years ago, who most likely had never heard the word. We examine the emergence of the concept of Asia, peoples in the regions known as Asia started to use the word, attached new meanings to it, and created new identities around it in the context of imperialism, nationalism, transnationalism, and globalization since the nineteenth century. Discussion includes political movements and cultural interaction of various places such as Iran, Turkey, Russia, India, China, and Japan, and encourages students to think about the validity of the concept of \u201cAsia\u201d to describe vastly different places. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus*  Examines   the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the   perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture,   gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix   of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's   global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history   of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive   transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four   centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable   influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of   the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial   economic and political structures; anthropological material on family   and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and   ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities   are expressed today. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 511, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Middle Eastern Societies Prof. Sayed (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) Major intellectual, political, social and cultural institutions and issues of the modern Middle East that have profoundly affected the region in the nineteenth and twentieth century. The emphasis throughout is to identify the ways in which specific concepts, events, and long-term processes have informed social and political realities, with a focus on important historical movements and ideas from the Ottoman and Egyptian reforms, through the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, to the creation of modern states. Topics include the Arab-Israeli conflict, the impact of the Iranian Revolution, the emergence of Islamic movements, the \"Arab Spring,\" and the development of Arab, pan-Islamism, and nation-state nationalism. Readings are drawn from primary documents, historical narratives, novels, short stories, and poetic expressions. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Schiffman (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times and the second Temple period and the emergence of classical Judaism, covering the period from c. 1400 B.C.E. to the third century C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in law and social organization, prophetic movements, history of Israelite religion and early Judaism, and ancient Hebrew and Jewish literature. The Hebrew Bible and Rabbinic literature preserve much of the creativity of ancient Israel; and archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages have added to our knowledge. In addition, new discoveries in the Dead Sea Scrolls contribute greatly to our understanding of the history of Judaism and the emergence of Christianity. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 515 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus* Over   the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced   extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape,   a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency,   state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on   events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact,   including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s,   and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary   sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the   major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range   of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony,   essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix   artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how   the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the   reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and   changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus * Utilizing   a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students   are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern   India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty   official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning   several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and   ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the   challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has   been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and   contemporarily. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 519, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Americas Prof. Goetz (History) What   does it mean to be an indigenous person in the Americas? Indigenous   peoples have fundamentally shaped and defined our past and continue to   shape contemporary life in the Americas, but their struggles are   routinely overlooked by the non-indigenous populations of the Americas.   We explore the experiences of indigenous peoples from the precontact era   to the present, using songs, poetry, novels, documentaries, and   historical documents. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 541 Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Eustace (History)  syllabus * During   the Atlantic Age of Sail, from the fifteenth though the nineteenth   centuries, the peoples of four continents\u2014Europe, Africa, North American   and South America\u2014began to interact in sustained and complex ways for   the first time. They brought to their encounters diverse cosmologies   (beliefs about the spiritual world), epistemologies (systems of knowing   and gathering empirical knowledge), family formations (networks of   kinship), state configurations (forms of political organization),   trading patterns (systems of material accumulation and exchange), and   traditions of war and peace (forms of conflict and negotiation across   groups). From their divergent approaches to the distribution and   regulation of land, population, and goods arose a complex new   transoceanic system that would tie together these four corners of the   Atlantic. Reading early historical accounts, travel narratives, personal   memoirs, novels, poems, and plays, we see how Atlantic peoples make   sense of their changing worlds and the creative tensions of encounter,   and come to understand the productive conflicts that ultimately gave   rise to an Age of Atlantic Revolutions.  SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus * Ancient   Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period   of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more   than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and   civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly   cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary   sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters,   and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of   art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars   analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use   these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious   beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and   achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to   critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the   secondary scholarship. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Forgacs (Italian Studies)  syllabus In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Concludes by tracing the enduring impacts of the unresolved past on contemporary society, Korea \u201ctoday\u201d in terms of economic development and crisis, the democracy movement and its limitations, relations with North Korea and with the US, and sociocultural diversification in the age of globalization. To forge critical perspectives on Korean history, society, and culture, students are encouraged to situate these topics within the broader contexts of East Asia and the world. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus * Spanish   modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a   major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and   successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a   conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and   feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for   anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity,   Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber   rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven   centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth   of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a   human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the   novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy,   the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian   princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492,   Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial   expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern,   disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property,   and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and   theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the   late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America)   kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing   fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the   Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of   Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s   current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include   history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 556, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Germany Prof. Wood (German)  syllabus* An introduction to the achievements and paradoxes of modern German history and culture. Crucial historical background is the invention of the printing press by Johann Gutenberg in the 1450s, the Protestant Reformation catalyzed by Martin Luther in 1517, and the Thirty Years\u2019 War of the seventeenth century, but the emphasis is on the shaping role that German art and thought have played within European modernity from the late eighteenth century to the present, culminating in the regeneration of German literature and art since the 1960s, involving such figures as Heinrich B\u00f6ll, Christa Wolf, Alexander Kluge, Ingeborg Bachmann, W.G. Sebald, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Josef Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, and Martin Kippenberger. Sources include literary, philosophical, and other texts, and works of art, architecture, music, and film.   Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus Spring 2016 SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 500, Cultures and Contexts: Topics\u2014Transnational Asia Prof. Koyagi (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) Where is \u201cAsia\u201d? What does \u201cAsia\u201d mean? Your answers to these questions would probably be very different from answers that an Iranian intellectual from ninety years ago would have given. Or an Indian poet from 150 years ago. Or a Japanese writer from 400 years ago, who most likely had never heard the word. We examine the emergence of the concept of Asia, peoples in the regions known as Asia started to use the word, attached new meanings to it, and created new identities around it in the context of imperialism, nationalism, transnationalism, and globalization since the nineteenth century. Discussion includes political movements and cultural interaction of various places such as Iran, Turkey, Russia, India, China, and Japan, and encourages students to think about the validity of the concept of \u201cAsia\u201d to describe vastly different places. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus*  Examines   the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the   perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture,   gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix   of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's   global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history   of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive   transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four   centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable   influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of   the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial   economic and political structures; anthropological material on family   and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and   ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities   are expressed today. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 511, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Middle Eastern Societies Prof. Sayed (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) Major intellectual, political, social and cultural institutions and issues of the modern Middle East that have profoundly affected the region in the nineteenth and twentieth century. The emphasis throughout is to identify the ways in which specific concepts, events, and long-term processes have informed social and political realities, with a focus on important historical movements and ideas from the Ottoman and Egyptian reforms, through the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, to the creation of modern states. Topics include the Arab-Israeli conflict, the impact of the Iranian Revolution, the emergence of Islamic movements, the \"Arab Spring,\" and the development of Arab, pan-Islamism, and nation-state nationalism. Readings are drawn from primary documents, historical narratives, novels, short stories, and poetic expressions. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Schiffman (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times and the second Temple period and the emergence of classical Judaism, covering the period from c. 1400 B.C.E. to the third century C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in law and social organization, prophetic movements, history of Israelite religion and early Judaism, and ancient Hebrew and Jewish literature. The Hebrew Bible and Rabbinic literature preserve much of the creativity of ancient Israel; and archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages have added to our knowledge. In addition, new discoveries in the Dead Sea Scrolls contribute greatly to our understanding of the history of Judaism and the emergence of Christianity. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 515 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus* Over   the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced   extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape,   a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency,   state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on   events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact,   including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s,   and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary   sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the   major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range   of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony,   essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix   artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how   the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the   reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and   changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus * Utilizing   a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students   are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern   India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty   official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning   several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and   ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the   challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has   been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and   contemporarily. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 519, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Americas Prof. Goetz (History) What   does it mean to be an indigenous person in the Americas? Indigenous   peoples have fundamentally shaped and defined our past and continue to   shape contemporary life in the Americas, but their struggles are   routinely overlooked by the non-indigenous populations of the Americas.   We explore the experiences of indigenous peoples from the precontact era   to the present, using songs, poetry, novels, documentaries, and   historical documents. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 541 Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Eustace (History)  syllabus * During   the Atlantic Age of Sail, from the fifteenth though the nineteenth   centuries, the peoples of four continents\u2014Europe, Africa, North American   and South America\u2014began to interact in sustained and complex ways for   the first time. They brought to their encounters diverse cosmologies   (beliefs about the spiritual world), epistemologies (systems of knowing   and gathering empirical knowledge), family formations (networks of   kinship), state configurations (forms of political organization),   trading patterns (systems of material accumulation and exchange), and   traditions of war and peace (forms of conflict and negotiation across   groups). From their divergent approaches to the distribution and   regulation of land, population, and goods arose a complex new   transoceanic system that would tie together these four corners of the   Atlantic. Reading early historical accounts, travel narratives, personal   memoirs, novels, poems, and plays, we see how Atlantic peoples make   sense of their changing worlds and the creative tensions of encounter,   and come to understand the productive conflicts that ultimately gave   rise to an Age of Atlantic Revolutions.  SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus * Ancient   Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period   of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more   than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and   civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly   cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary   sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters,   and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of   art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars   analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use   these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious   beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and   achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to   critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the   secondary scholarship. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Forgacs (Italian Studies)  syllabus In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Together with tours and special lectures, the first half of the course will focus on some historical background. (The facts are important, but no one in the Middle East agrees on \u201cthe facts.\u201d In this part of the world, debates about the past have a huge impact on the present.) Without going too much into the past, we will examine the formative events of Israeli society, those events that explain the special features of Israel today \u2013 its politics, institutions, culture, popular thinking and more. The course will begin in 1948 and progress to contemporary issues, including the most controversial ones.                              Language Courses   All students at NYU Tel Aviv will be required to take a course in either Hebrew or Arabic language. This course must be taken for graded credit. (Not pass/fail.) For native speakers or those who have already achieved an advanced level of proficiency, special arrangements will be made (e.g. direct enrollment in a pre-approved course at a local university, directed readings, or special tutorial sessions).                                                  The Languages of Israel - HBRJD-UA 9140 or MEIS-UA 9150 - 4 points                               This course also fulfills the language requirement for Global Programs.   Is Israel a multilingual or a monolingual country? This is a question with which many educators, linguists, politicians and laypeople have been struggling. In this course we will explore several issues of language use and practice in Israel, language ideology and language policy.   We will start by learning the orthographies (spelling systems) of Hebrew and Arabic and practice them through the methodology of Linguistic Landscape. We will tour Tel Aviv-Jaffa and other places and study public signs and their use in Hebrew and Arabic as well as in other languages. We will look at signs, advertisements, instructions, buildings, streets, billboards, etc. This exercise will teach us much about the public space, who controls it and what cultural and political messages it sends us.

This course offers an overview of the history of archaeology in Palestine since the appearance of the first European travelers and missionaries in the mid-19th century, along the vibrant interest of collectors, forgers and robbers in the Promised Land, through the appearance of the first scientific excavations, the rise of the American biblical archaeology and its influence on local Israeli research.   Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos.   The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon. Finally, at the turn of the millennium, post-modern archaeology presented a new pluralistic view of the past. This multi-vocal framework will be used as a background for discussing the archaeology of otherness and minorities in 21st century Israel.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

Is Israel a multilingual or a monolingual country? This is a question with which many educators, linguists, politicians and laypeople have been struggling. In this course we will explore several issues of language use and practice in Israel, language ideology and language policy.   We will start by learning the orthographies (spelling systems) of Hebrew and Arabic and practice them through the methodology of Linguistic Landscape. We will tour Tel Aviv-Jaffa and other places and study public signs and their use in Hebrew and Arabic as well as in other languages. We will look at signs, advertisements, instructions, buildings, streets, billboards, etc. This exercise will teach us much about the public space, who controls it and what cultural and political messages it sends us.

The course aims to introduce the fundamental historical trajectories of the conflict, and to present and analyze the conflicting narratives and perceptions of both Palestinians and Israelis over key moments and issues in its history. By so doing, we will pay specific attention to the respective histories of the conflict, as well as to the challenges that each side is encountering over the future of the conflict and possible solutions to it. Among other issues, the course focuses on key moments in the history of Palestine during the British mandate; the conflicting narratives over the 1948 war; Israel and the Palestinians between 1948-1967; the 1967 war and its implications on Israel and the Palestinians; the development of the Palestinian national movement; the first and second Intifadas and the challenges to the Oslo peace process. The course will address these issues through a variety of readings, primary sources and films. As a conclusion, the students will present their own reflections and analyses of various aspects of the history of the conflict and debate its future implications.

Israel: Fact through Film and Fiction - HBRJD-UA 9TBA - 4 points - Under Development                               Israeli Cinema has finally come of age. It has caught up with Israeli literature, scoring awards and world-wide recognition not only for its artistic achievements but also for its gutsy in-depth engagement with political, social, and sex-and-gender borders and boundaries that are local and universal at one and the same time. The course will explore some of these issues as they are tackled in contemporary cinema and fiction. Classes will be organized in three thematic clusters:     \u201cFamily, I Love and Hate You\u201d   \u201cThe Political is Personal Too\u201d: War, Terror, Self-sacrifice   Crossing the Lines: Trauma, Sex, Gender, Ethnicity       (This grouping is determined by what seems to be a work\u2019s major theme, though most of works studied, and certainly the best among them, are bi- or multi-focal, crossing several boundaries of universal divisions.)

We will cover topics such as democracy origins, consolidation, transitions to democracy, democratization processes, origins of dictatorships, role of institutions in dictatorships, etc. We will first cover the theoretical foundations of each topic, and then we will give empirical examples.   While many countries in the international system are democratic, the quality of these democracies is questionable and varies considerably across them. Many in some of these democracies suffer from deep levels of corruption, poor elite accountability, human rights abuses and violations, and oftentimes policies that go against the very foundations of democratic governance. We will cover in the course the classic regime types (democracy, hybrid regimes, and dictatorship), transitions between them, and the strategies they (and their leaders) use to stay in power.

Approved Courses for the Current Semester                                                          Jewish Ethics: Sin, Forgiveness, Repentance - TAU 2302 - 4 points                               In this course, we shall examine basic concepts in Jewish religious ethics through the prism of one foundational concept in this religion - the concept of repentance. Our investigation will evolve around the following questions: How does the Jewish religion understand the notion of sin and what are the implications of these understandings? What exactly is repentance in the Jewish tradition and what are its different components? How is it possible to erase sins that have already been committed? The course will be structured along two parallel lines, First, we shall advance chronologically from an introductory part that deals with ancient notions of sin and repentance to modern understandings of these ideas. Second, the chronological layer will be arranged around thematic sections that include issues such as confession, atonement, forgiveness and self-improvement. As a result, a better understanding of religious subjectivity and Jewish morality will emerge.                                                                      Social and Cultural History of the Modern Middle East - TAU 1201 - 4 points                               If until the last third of the twentieth century history mostly addressed the lives and deeds of \u201cbig men\u201d \u2013 rulers, diplomats, generals, or inventors \u2013 historians have in recent decades gradually broadened their perspective to include in their narratives women, the middle- and then lower classes, and eventually non-Western people as well. Along these lines, this course examines the history of the modern Middle East from the bottom up. We will examine what made the nineteenth and twentieth centuries \u201cmodern\u201d for the inhabitants of the region and what constituted their lived experience of the tumults of colonialism, nationalism and post-colonialism. Exploring case studies from Egypt, Israel\\Palestine, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia among other settings, we will examine the shifting media infrastructures, cultural protocols, religious beliefs, class formations, and political agendas of different social groups in the region. Beyond reading recent and innovative academic literature on these issues, instruction will heavily rely on primary materials such as graffiti, cinema, music and recordings of religious materials, poetry and short stories.

In an almost emblematic way, this position and function seems to be embodied in our image of the far-distant caravan trader, traversing on the so-called \u201cSilk roads\u201d the vast expanses between China and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. However, it was not only traders that connected the civilizations of the ancient world via Central Asia: with and next to the traders\u2019 caravans traveled diplomats, missionaries, artists and many more; and vast parts of Eurasia were, again and again, connected and controlled by confederations and empires of nomadic origin. We inquire into the many facets, which characterize the resulting network, oscillating around Central Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the Mongol Empire, taking a multi-disciplinary approach to a considerable variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus The South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality, and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television, internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (History)  syllabus Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 512, Cultures &amp; Contexts: China Prof. Zhang (East Asian Studies)  syllabus  An introduction to the main issues and foundational texts of imperial and modern China. Selected readings include excerpts from early Chinese classics such as Classic of Odes and the Analects to the vernacular novels of late imperial China. The classical canon is then coupled with central texts from modern China, from the initial reflections of the mandarin scholars on a rapidly changing world, to writings on revolution, the modern state, and the new culture of the enlightened individual by leading Chinese intellectuals in the 20th century. Rather than a display of cultural and literary edifices, our intellectual and critical interest is to rethink Chinese traditions, both imperial and modern, in terms of continuity as well as discontinuity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus  Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: African Diaspora Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to non-African influences. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 536, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology)  syllabus  The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Saranillio (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Examines significant historical and contemporary moments through an analysis of culture and power and how cultural productions--film, television dramas, novels, visual art, national monuments and memorials, among others--produce ideas, stories and silences in different historical moments about different Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have contemporary resonance today. For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 540, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Mongol Asia and Its Legacy Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to the outskirts of Central Europe. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. We examine the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective emphasizing the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Themes include nomadic life and culture, the structure of a nomadic empire, how that nomadic empire interacted with the various settled states it conquered, and ramifications of the Mongol conquest on economy and trade, medicine, science and technology, food and art, culture and religion, as well as social and intellectual developments across Eurasia, during the time period from approximately 1200 to 1450 C.E. Our primary sources will be narratives of Mongols generals, stories of peoples they conquered, and travelogues of people who travelled in Mongol territories, and we also look at visual depictions of the Mongols in art and cinema, pay special attention to the environment and how it shaped the life of the Mongols, dedicate time to the image of Genghis Khan, the role played by women, both from the commoner society and from the elite, and interactions with Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, and Islam. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus  Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 552, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and the Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) and Prof. Cooper (History)  syllabus  Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 555, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History)  syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus  The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 505, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 507, Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Kaffen (East Asian Studies)  syllabus Japan from 1945 to the present, through cinema, animation, photography, manga, television, kami shibai, pop songs, and other creative forms of expression and documentation, with emphasis on various points of view both within Japan (women, youth, burakumin, Okinawan), and externally (the US-Japan relationship, Japan\u2019s relationship with its East- Asian neighbors). We consider the ways Japan is framed and imagined, as well as the tensions, contradictions, and variety of perspectives at work in those imaginations; the processes of mediation through which history and place are constructed; and issues such as war responsibility, high economic growth, political radicalism, technology and consumption, and \u201clost decades,\u201d and what they might mean for a consideration of Japan\u2019s place in the world at present. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus  Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus  Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 541, Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Tortorici (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus  What was America before it was called \u201cAmerica\u201d? How did indigenous peoples understand and document their first encounters with Europeans and Africans? We focus on how the convergence of indigenous, African, European, and Asian peoples in the Americas created complex cultures, societies, ethnicities, and forms of religiosity. Beginning with the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the \u201cIndies\u201d by Christopher Columbus in 1492, we work our way thematically and chronologically through the centuries of conquest and colonial rule, up until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. We also examine the historical context before 1492 in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East (with an emphasis on how particular Old World encounters affected New World encounters). SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History)  syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 553, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Pagan Europe, 60\u20131600 C.E. Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History)  syllabus  In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus  The culture of modern Italy\u2014a nation younger than the United States, yet steeped in all manner of millennial traditions, linguistic dialects, and regional artistic and economic customs. \u201cWe have made Italy; we must now make Italians.\u201d Thus declared the politician and writer Massimo d\u2019Azeglio following the country\u2019s belated unification in 1861. How has Italy attempted to \u201cmake Italians\u201d over the last century? What forms of culture could unify a people so diverse in origins and aspirations? Has the country managed to transform itself from a \u201cgeographic idea\u201d to a cultural reality? Aside from commonplaces\u2014rolling hills, historical landmarks, beloved cuisine, fashion runways\u2014what are the bel paese\u2019s most salient cultural characteristics, and why do they matter? We examine cultural manifestations in various visual, verbal, and material forms: manifestos, cinema, literature, popular music, poetry, architecture, painting, television, exhibitions, and journalism.

Bagnall and Potts (Institute for the Study of the Ancient World)  syllabus * For centuries the Indian Ocean basin has been a conduit for a variety of cultural encounters and transfers between South Asia, Arabia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. The sea routes through the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, down the coast of East Africa, and across the Indian Ocean, have been the maritime counterpart to the complex of land routes often called collectively the \"Silk Road.\" They were trade routes, certainly; but the civilizations in this vast expanse were also connected by military action, diplomacy, the diffusion of religion and artistic currents, and many more interconnections. We look at the many facets that characterize the resulting network, involving the whole area from the Mediterranean to South Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the earliest European involvement in the region. The approach is multi-disciplinary throughout, as we consider a variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts, and how these different kinds of evidence contribute in the scholarly reconstruction of an early globalized world. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 500, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Civil War and Its Aftermath in 20th Century Spain Prof. Labanyi (Spanish and Portuguese)  syllabus*  The   Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 has been called the last war fought for   utopian ideals; it was also the first war to see mass bombing of   civilian targets, and was internationalization as a fight between   Fascism and Communism, thanks to support for the right-wing military   uprising by Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, and support for the   left-wing Republican Government by the Soviet Union and international   volunteers from across the globe. While World War II ended with the   defeat of fascism, Spain\u2019s Civil War ended with fascism\u2019s triumph and   the institution of a dictatorship, under General Franco, that lasted   almost 40 years, during which the winners of the war were ritually   remembered, while the losers suffered savage reprisals and could not be   mentioned in public. After his death in 1975, feelings about the war   were still so strong that the topic was avoided, to ensure a peaceful   transition to democracy; but since the mid-1990s, the topic has surfaced   in often acrimonious public debate and a proliferation of cultural   representations, as Spain tries to come to terms with the wounds of a   civil conflict only now starting to be addressed. We explore the   political issues involved in the Spanish Civil War and its remembrance   today, considering a wide range of materials, including letters from the   front by U.S. volunteers held in the archive of the Abraham Lincoln   Brigade here at NYU, Picasso\u2019s Guernica, and historical and contemporary   films, and raising issues about the politics of memory, trauma,   post-memory, and national reconciliation.  FALL 2015 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus * The   South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary   globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population   experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of   massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption   and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality,   and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet   central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media   industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy   as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to   social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides   entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television,   internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for   understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship   between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated   religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (Russian &amp; Slavic Studies/History)  syllabus * Focuses   on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in   Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary   works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all   periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing   positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus * The   people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an   ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual   state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel,   when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older   origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of   reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing   projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 525, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America and the Caribbean Profs. Ferrer and Thomson (History)  syllabus* A general introduction to the history and culture of Latin America, focusing on major themes in the history of the region: colonization and interaction between Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people; the Atlantic slave trade and the creation of slave and plantation societies; race, nationalism, and revolution; and the place of the United States and Africa in the region. Readings include Spanish and indigenous accounts of the Conquest, firsthand accounts of the slave trade, revolutionary manifestos, political cartoons, and a range of other sources. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus * Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus * Major   issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to   contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a   formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical   context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which   they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions   concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers   of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the   problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion   of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times   parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the   politics of translation into European modalities. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus* Modern   Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population,   Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its   ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins   of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and   the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli   society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular   state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system,   the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the   role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a   survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of   all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in   the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli   society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international   limelight. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Tu (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)   syllabus * Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization, among others. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. As an expression/reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts, we pay particular attention to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions--films, literature, art, media, and popular culture. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 543, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Korea [Staff] (East Asian Studies)  syllabus A multi-disciplinary introduction to Korean society and culture, surveying Korean history from antiquity to the present though a wide range of primary sources from the past, including archaeological relics, written records, and works of art, as well as contemporary materials by Korean authors, directors, and other cultural producers. Considers the origins of Korean \u201ctradition,\u201d the formation and development of social relations, popular beliefs, and systems of thought that have shaped the Korean way of life, in order to locate their resonances and ramifications in modern Korea, particularly in cultural representations. Continues with Korea\u2019s \u201ctransformation\u201d through its encounter with the West, its modern experiences and national struggle under colonial rule, social upheavals after liberation, and the Korean War. Concludes by tracing the enduring impacts of the unresolved past on contemporary society, Korea \u201ctoday\u201d in terms of economic development and crisis, the democracy movement and its limitations, relations with North Korea and with the US, and sociocultural diversification in the age of globalization. To forge critical perspectives on Korean history, society, and culture, students are encouraged to situate these topics within the broader contexts of East Asia and the world. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus * Spanish   modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a   major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and   successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a   conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and   feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for   anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity,   Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber   rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven   centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth   of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a   human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the   novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy,   the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished.

Materials include   history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 556, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Germany Prof. Wood (German)  syllabus* An introduction to the achievements and paradoxes of modern German history and culture. Crucial historical background is the invention of the printing press by Johann Gutenberg in the 1450s, the Protestant Reformation catalyzed by Martin Luther in 1517, and the Thirty Years\u2019 War of the seventeenth century, but the emphasis is on the shaping role that German art and thought have played within European modernity from the late eighteenth century to the present, culminating in the regeneration of German literature and art since the 1960s, involving such figures as Heinrich B\u00f6ll, Christa Wolf, Alexander Kluge, Ingeborg Bachmann, W.G. Sebald, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Josef Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, and Martin Kippenberger. Sources include literary, philosophical, and other texts, and works of art, architecture, music, and film.   Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus Spring 2016 SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 500, Cultures and Contexts: Topics\u2014Transnational Asia Prof. Koyagi (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) Where is \u201cAsia\u201d? What does \u201cAsia\u201d mean? Your answers to these questions would probably be very different from answers that an Iranian intellectual from ninety years ago would have given. Or an Indian poet from 150 years ago. Or a Japanese writer from 400 years ago, who most likely had never heard the word. We examine the emergence of the concept of Asia, peoples in the regions known as Asia started to use the word, attached new meanings to it, and created new identities around it in the context of imperialism, nationalism, transnationalism, and globalization since the nineteenth century. Discussion includes political movements and cultural interaction of various places such as Iran, Turkey, Russia, India, China, and Japan, and encourages students to think about the validity of the concept of \u201cAsia\u201d to describe vastly different places. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus*  Examines   the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the   perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture,   gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix   of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's   global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history   of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive   transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four   centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable   influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of   the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial   economic and political structures; anthropological material on family   and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and   ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities   are expressed today. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 511, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Middle Eastern Societies Prof. Sayed (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) Major intellectual, political, social and cultural institutions and issues of the modern Middle East that have profoundly affected the region in the nineteenth and twentieth century. The emphasis throughout is to identify the ways in which specific concepts, events, and long-term processes have informed social and political realities, with a focus on important historical movements and ideas from the Ottoman and Egyptian reforms, through the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, to the creation of modern states. Topics include the Arab-Israeli conflict, the impact of the Iranian Revolution, the emergence of Islamic movements, the \"Arab Spring,\" and the development of Arab, pan-Islamism, and nation-state nationalism. Readings are drawn from primary documents, historical narratives, novels, short stories, and poetic expressions. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Schiffman (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times and the second Temple period and the emergence of classical Judaism, covering the period from c. 1400 B.C.E. to the third century C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in law and social organization, prophetic movements, history of Israelite religion and early Judaism, and ancient Hebrew and Jewish literature. The Hebrew Bible and Rabbinic literature preserve much of the creativity of ancient Israel; and archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages have added to our knowledge. In addition, new discoveries in the Dead Sea Scrolls contribute greatly to our understanding of the history of Judaism and the emergence of Christianity. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 515 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus* Over   the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced   extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape,   a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency,   state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on   events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact,   including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s,   and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary   sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the   major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range   of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony,   essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix   artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how   the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the   reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and   changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus * Utilizing   a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students   are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern   India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty   official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning   several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and   ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the   challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has   been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and   contemporarily. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 519, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Americas Prof. Goetz (History) What   does it mean to be an indigenous person in the Americas? Indigenous   peoples have fundamentally shaped and defined our past and continue to   shape contemporary life in the Americas, but their struggles are   routinely overlooked by the non-indigenous populations of the Americas.   We explore the experiences of indigenous peoples from the precontact era   to the present, using songs, poetry, novels, documentaries, and   historical documents. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 541 Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Eustace (History)  syllabus * During   the Atlantic Age of Sail, from the fifteenth though the nineteenth   centuries, the peoples of four continents\u2014Europe, Africa, North American   and South America\u2014began to interact in sustained and complex ways for   the first time. They brought to their encounters diverse cosmologies   (beliefs about the spiritual world), epistemologies (systems of knowing   and gathering empirical knowledge), family formations (networks of   kinship), state configurations (forms of political organization),   trading patterns (systems of material accumulation and exchange), and   traditions of war and peace (forms of conflict and negotiation across   groups). From their divergent approaches to the distribution and   regulation of land, population, and goods arose a complex new   transoceanic system that would tie together these four corners of the   Atlantic. Reading early historical accounts, travel narratives, personal   memoirs, novels, poems, and plays, we see how Atlantic peoples make   sense of their changing worlds and the creative tensions of encounter,   and come to understand the productive conflicts that ultimately gave   rise to an Age of Atlantic Revolutions.  SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus * Ancient   Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period   of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more   than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and   civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly   cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary   sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters,   and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of   art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars   analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use   these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious   beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and   achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to   critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the   secondary scholarship. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Forgacs (Italian Studies)  syllabus In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Together with tours and special lectures, the first half of the course will focus on some historical background. (The facts are important, but no one in the Middle East agrees on \u201cthe facts.\u201d In this part of the world, debates about the past have a huge impact on the present.) Without going too much into the past, we will examine the formative events of Israeli society, those events that explain the special features of Israel today \u2013 its politics, institutions, culture, popular thinking and more. The course will begin in 1948 and progress to contemporary issues, including the most controversial ones.                              Language Courses   All students at NYU Tel Aviv will be required to take a course in either Hebrew or Arabic language. This course must be taken for graded credit. (Not pass/fail.) For native speakers or those who have already achieved an advanced level of proficiency, special arrangements will be made (e.g. direct enrollment in a pre-approved course at a local university, directed readings, or special tutorial sessions).                                                  The Languages of Israel - HBRJD-UA 9140 or MEIS-UA 9150 - 4 points                               This course also fulfills the language requirement for Global Programs.   Is Israel a multilingual or a monolingual country? This is a question with which many educators, linguists, politicians and laypeople have been struggling. In this course we will explore several issues of language use and practice in Israel, language ideology and language policy.   We will start by learning the orthographies (spelling systems) of Hebrew and Arabic and practice them through the methodology of Linguistic Landscape. We will tour Tel Aviv-Jaffa and other places and study public signs and their use in Hebrew and Arabic as well as in other languages. We will look at signs, advertisements, instructions, buildings, streets, billboards, etc. This exercise will teach us much about the public space, who controls it and what cultural and political messages it sends us.

Gallatin School of Individualized Study                                                  Ancient Israel: History and Archaeology - Travelers, Collectors and Antiquities Robbers -\u00a0HBRJD-UA\u00a09118 or HIST-UA 9524 or SASEM-UG 9550 - 4 points                               The story of the archaeological discipline in the Land of Israel is strongly tied with the major developments that the region has undergone in the last two centuries. This course offers an overview of the history of archaeology in Palestine since the appearance of the first European travelers and missionaries in the mid-19th century, along the vibrant interest of collectors, forgers and robbers in the Promised Land, through the appearance of the first scientific excavations, the rise of the American biblical archaeology and its influence on local Israeli research.   Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos.   The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon. Finally, at the turn of the millennium, post-modern archaeology presented a new pluralistic view of the past. This multi-vocal framework will be used as a background for discussing the archaeology of otherness and minorities in 21st century Israel.                                                                    Internship Seminar and Fieldwork - SCA-UA 9042 or INDIV-UG 9550 - 4 points                                     Course includes weekly seminar and minimum of 10 hours fieldwork/ week at approved internship field-site.    The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

The course aims to introduce the fundamental historical trajectories of the conflict, and to present and analyze the conflicting narratives and perceptions of both Palestinians and Israelis over key moments and issues in its history. By so doing, we will pay specific attention to the respective histories of the conflict, as well as to the challenges that each side is encountering over the future of the conflict and possible solutions to it. Among other issues, the course focuses on key moments in the history of Palestine during the British mandate; the conflicting narratives over the 1948 war; Israel and the Palestinians between 1948-1967; the 1967 war and its implications on Israel and the Palestinians; the development of the Palestinian national movement; the first and second Intifadas and the challenges to the Oslo peace process. The course will address these issues through a variety of readings, primary sources and films. As a conclusion, the students will present their own reflections and analyses of various aspects of the history of the conflict and debate its future implications.

This course offers an overview of the history of archaeology in Palestine since the appearance of the first European travelers and missionaries in the mid-19th century, along the vibrant interest of collectors, forgers and robbers in the Promised Land, through the appearance of the first scientific excavations, the rise of the American biblical archaeology and its influence on local Israeli research.   Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos.   The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon. Finally, at the turn of the millennium, post-modern archaeology presented a new pluralistic view of the past. This multi-vocal framework will be used as a background for discussing the archaeology of otherness and minorities in 21st century Israel.                                                                    Israel: Fact through Film and Fiction - HBRJD-UA 9TBA - 4 points - Under Development                               Israeli Cinema has finally come of age. It has caught up with Israeli literature, scoring awards and world-wide recognition not only for its artistic achievements but also for its gutsy in-depth engagement with political, social, and sex-and-gender borders and boundaries that are local and universal at one and the same time. The course will explore some of these issues as they are tackled in contemporary cinema and fiction. Classes will be organized in three thematic clusters:     \u201cFamily, I Love and Hate You\u201d   \u201cThe Political is Personal Too\u201d: War, Terror, Self-sacrifice   Crossing the Lines: Trauma, Sex, Gender, Ethnicity       (This grouping is determined by what seems to be a work\u2019s major theme, though most of works studied, and certainly the best among them, are bi- or multi-focal, crossing several boundaries of universal divisions.)   When appropriate, students will be asked to prepare relevant backgrounds materials \u2013 socio- historical studies, reviews, etc.                                History                                                    History of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict - HIST-UA 9553 or HBRJD-UA 9948 or MEIS-UA 9751 - 4 points                               This course will take the students through the history and the various realities and challenges of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The course aims to introduce the fundamental historical trajectories of the conflict, and to present and analyze the conflicting narratives and perceptions of both Palestinians and Israelis over key moments and issues in its history. By so doing, we will pay specific attention to the respective histories of the conflict, as well as to the challenges that each side is encountering over the future of the conflict and possible solutions to it.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

We will cover topics such as democracy origins, consolidation, transitions to democracy, democratization processes, origins of dictatorships, role of institutions in dictatorships, etc. We will first cover the theoretical foundations of each topic, and then we will give empirical examples.   While many countries in the international system are democratic, the quality of these democracies is questionable and varies considerably across them. Many in some of these democracies suffer from deep levels of corruption, poor elite accountability, human rights abuses and violations, and oftentimes policies that go against the very foundations of democratic governance. We will cover in the course the classic regime types (democracy, hybrid regimes, and dictatorship), transitions between them, and the strategies they (and their leaders) use to stay in power.   Sample Syllabus                                  Tel Aviv University     Tel Aviv University (TAU) is Israel's largest higher education institution and is home to 30,000 students studying in the academic areas of science, humanities and the arts. NYU is pleased to allow students to enroll in TAU courses for NYU credit. This exciting opportunity allows students to engage with local students in the classroom.   Below is a list of courses that are either approved for the current semester or have been approved in the past (as specified). If you are interested in taking courses at TAU that are not listed below, please email global.academics@nyu.edu for more information.                Approved Courses for the Current Semester                                                          Jewish Ethics: Sin, Forgiveness, Repentance - TAU 2302 - 4 points                               In this course, we shall examine basic concepts in Jewish religious ethics through the prism of one foundational concept in this religion - the concept of repentance. Our investigation will evolve around the following questions: How does the Jewish religion understand the notion of sin and what are the implications of these understandings? What exactly is repentance in the Jewish tradition and what are its different components? How is it possible to erase sins that have already been committed? The course will be structured along two parallel lines, First, we shall advance chronologically from an introductory part that deals with ancient notions of sin and repentance to modern understandings of these ideas. Second, the chronological layer will be arranged around thematic sections that include issues such as confession, atonement, forgiveness and self-improvement. As a result, a better understanding of religious subjectivity and Jewish morality will emerge.                                                                      Social and Cultural History of the Modern Middle East - TAU 1201 - 4 points                               If until the last third of the twentieth century history mostly addressed the lives and deeds of \u201cbig men\u201d \u2013 rulers, diplomats, generals, or inventors \u2013 historians have in recent decades gradually broadened their perspective to include in their narratives women, the middle- and then lower classes, and eventually non-Western people as well. Along these lines, this course examines the history of the modern Middle East from the bottom up. We will examine what made the nineteenth and twentieth centuries \u201cmodern\u201d for the inhabitants of the region and what constituted their lived experience of the tumults of colonialism, nationalism and post-colonialism. Exploring case studies from Egypt, Israel\\Palestine, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia among other settings, we will examine the shifting media infrastructures, cultural protocols, religious beliefs, class formations, and political agendas of different social groups in the region. Beyond reading recent and innovative academic literature on these issues, instruction will heavily rely on primary materials such as graffiti, cinema, music and recordings of religious materials, poetry and short stories.

In an almost emblematic way, this position and function seems to be embodied in our image of the far-distant caravan trader, traversing on the so-called \u201cSilk roads\u201d the vast expanses between China and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. However, it was not only traders that connected the civilizations of the ancient world via Central Asia: with and next to the traders\u2019 caravans traveled diplomats, missionaries, artists and many more; and vast parts of Eurasia were, again and again, connected and controlled by confederations and empires of nomadic origin. We inquire into the many facets, which characterize the resulting network, oscillating around Central Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the Mongol Empire, taking a multi-disciplinary approach to a considerable variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus The South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality, and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television, internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (History)  syllabus Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 512, Cultures &amp; Contexts: China Prof. Zhang (East Asian Studies)  syllabus  An introduction to the main issues and foundational texts of imperial and modern China. Selected readings include excerpts from early Chinese classics such as Classic of Odes and the Analects to the vernacular novels of late imperial China. The classical canon is then coupled with central texts from modern China, from the initial reflections of the mandarin scholars on a rapidly changing world, to writings on revolution, the modern state, and the new culture of the enlightened individual by leading Chinese intellectuals in the 20th century. Rather than a display of cultural and literary edifices, our intellectual and critical interest is to rethink Chinese traditions, both imperial and modern, in terms of continuity as well as discontinuity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus  Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: African Diaspora Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to non-African influences. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 536, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology)  syllabus  The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Saranillio (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Examines significant historical and contemporary moments through an analysis of culture and power and how cultural productions--film, television dramas, novels, visual art, national monuments and memorials, among others--produce ideas, stories and silences in different historical moments about different Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have contemporary resonance today. For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 540, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Mongol Asia and Its Legacy Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to the outskirts of Central Europe. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. We examine the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective emphasizing the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Themes include nomadic life and culture, the structure of a nomadic empire, how that nomadic empire interacted with the various settled states it conquered, and ramifications of the Mongol conquest on economy and trade, medicine, science and technology, food and art, culture and religion, as well as social and intellectual developments across Eurasia, during the time period from approximately 1200 to 1450 C.E. Our primary sources will be narratives of Mongols generals, stories of peoples they conquered, and travelogues of people who travelled in Mongol territories, and we also look at visual depictions of the Mongols in art and cinema, pay special attention to the environment and how it shaped the life of the Mongols, dedicate time to the image of Genghis Khan, the role played by women, both from the commoner society and from the elite, and interactions with Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, and Islam. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus  Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 552, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and the Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) and Prof. Cooper (History)  syllabus  Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 555, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History)  syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus  The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 505, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 507, Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Kaffen (East Asian Studies)  syllabus Japan from 1945 to the present, through cinema, animation, photography, manga, television, kami shibai, pop songs, and other creative forms of expression and documentation, with emphasis on various points of view both within Japan (women, youth, burakumin, Okinawan), and externally (the US-Japan relationship, Japan\u2019s relationship with its East- Asian neighbors). We consider the ways Japan is framed and imagined, as well as the tensions, contradictions, and variety of perspectives at work in those imaginations; the processes of mediation through which history and place are constructed; and issues such as war responsibility, high economic growth, political radicalism, technology and consumption, and \u201clost decades,\u201d and what they might mean for a consideration of Japan\u2019s place in the world at present. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus  Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus  Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 541, Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Tortorici (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus  What was America before it was called \u201cAmerica\u201d? How did indigenous peoples understand and document their first encounters with Europeans and Africans? We focus on how the convergence of indigenous, African, European, and Asian peoples in the Americas created complex cultures, societies, ethnicities, and forms of religiosity. Beginning with the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the \u201cIndies\u201d by Christopher Columbus in 1492, we work our way thematically and chronologically through the centuries of conquest and colonial rule, up until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. We also examine the historical context before 1492 in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East (with an emphasis on how particular Old World encounters affected New World encounters). SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History)  syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 553, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Pagan Europe, 60\u20131600 C.E. Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History)  syllabus  In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus  The culture of modern Italy\u2014a nation younger than the United States, yet steeped in all manner of millennial traditions, linguistic dialects, and regional artistic and economic customs. \u201cWe have made Italy; we must now make Italians.\u201d Thus declared the politician and writer Massimo d\u2019Azeglio following the country\u2019s belated unification in 1861. How has Italy attempted to \u201cmake Italians\u201d over the last century? What forms of culture could unify a people so diverse in origins and aspirations? Has the country managed to transform itself from a \u201cgeographic idea\u201d to a cultural reality? Aside from commonplaces\u2014rolling hills, historical landmarks, beloved cuisine, fashion runways\u2014what are the bel paese\u2019s most salient cultural characteristics, and why do they matter? We examine cultural manifestations in various visual, verbal, and material forms: manifestos, cinema, literature, popular music, poetry, architecture, painting, television, exhibitions, and journalism.
