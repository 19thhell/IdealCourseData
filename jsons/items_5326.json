The composers contribute in a fundamental way, as well, to the critical debate, analysis, and presentation of new music in the Department. During their first two years, composers typically take one course in musicology, and one in ethnomusicology; for many, this experience is a rich source of new orientations. A more discrete discussion of issues in contemporary composition occurs in the Composers Seminar, and in the context of discussions with guests, regularly invited to teach or to speak in the Department's colloquium series. The Composition Seminar includes visits each semester by invited composers and theorists, and a several-day residency in the spring of each year brings a composer of international stature to participate in department activities under the aegis of the Samuel and Beverly Sirota Endowment for Music. Recent and future invitees include Helmut Lachenmann (2008), Maria de Alvear (2009), and Chaya Czernowin (2010). Areas supported by faculty expertise include critical theory, and music and the political; sound as embodiment; philosophy as a language or structure for addressing musicological questions; generative and explanatory models of music, including those non-parametrically oriented. Creative activity across a wide spectrum is embraced. Composers may choose to explore established chamber, orchestral or vocal genres, or experiment with new interstices between composer, performer, and audience. Many students choose to focus on computer music as an expressive medium, or as a tool for applications to their work in acoustic composition. Composition students receive department-sponsored performances of their works by professional ensembles. Students may also participate in First Performance, a graduate student-run organization dedicated to the presentation of new music. Past ensembles presenting concerts of student works at NYU have included the Arditti Quartet, the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE), Alarm Will Sound, the New York Virtuoso Singers, and the American Brass Quintet, among others. Resident groups for 2008-09 include the Jack String Quartet and TimeTable Percussion. The Washington Square Computer Music Studio is a comprehensive facility for graduate composition and research in electroacoustic music. The Washington Square Contemporary Music Society, co-sponsored by the Department, presents a three-concert new music series at Merkin Hall each year, often featuring faculty and student work. Our reasonably small program allows excellent advising, funding, and job placement. All of our graduate students receive tuition remission and MacCracken Fellowships . Our doctoral students may take courses at CUNY Graduate Center, Columbia University, the New School University, and other distinguished universities in the region though the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium.

The composers contribute in a fundamental way, as well, to the critical debate, analysis, and presentation of new music in the Department. During their first two years, composers typically take one course in musicology, and one in ethnomusicology; for many, this experience is a rich source of new orientations. A more discrete discussion of issues in contemporary composition occurs in the Composers Seminar, and in the context of discussions with guests, regularly invited to teach or to speak in the Department's colloquium series. The Composition Seminar includes visits each semester by invited composers and theorists, and a several-day residency in the spring of each year brings a composer of international stature to participate in department activities under the aegis of the Samuel and Beverly Sirota Endowment for Music. Recent and future invitees include Helmut Lachenmann (2008), Maria de Alvear (2009), and Chaya Czernowin (2010). Areas supported by faculty expertise include critical theory, and music and the political; sound as embodiment; philosophy as a language or structure for addressing musicological questions; generative and explanatory models of music, including those non-parametrically oriented. Creative activity across a wide spectrum is embraced. Composers may choose to explore established chamber, orchestral or vocal genres, or experiment with new interstices between composer, performer, and audience. Many students choose to focus on computer music as an expressive medium, or as a tool for applications to their work in acoustic composition. Composition students receive department-sponsored performances of their works by professional ensembles. Students may also participate in First Performance, a graduate student-run organization dedicated to the presentation of new music. Past ensembles presenting concerts of student works at NYU have included the Arditti Quartet, the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE), Alarm Will Sound, the New York Virtuoso Singers, and the American Brass Quintet, among others. Resident groups for 2008-09 include the Jack String Quartet and TimeTable Percussion. The Washington Square Computer Music Studio is a comprehensive facility for graduate composition and research in electroacoustic music. The Washington Square Contemporary Music Society, co-sponsored by the Department, presents a three-concert new music series at Merkin Hall each year, often featuring faculty and student work. Our reasonably small program allows excellent advising, funding, and job placement. All of our graduate students receive tuition remission and MacCracken Fellowships . Our doctoral students may take courses at CUNY Graduate Center, Columbia University, the New School University, and other distinguished universities in the region though the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium.

Both undergraduate and graduate composers enjoy the benefits of working in an intimate conservatory setting surrounded by superb performers. The programs live within a large and enriching university environment in the heart of New York City. The undergraduate program offers excellent instruction in musicianship, music history, theory, and technology along with regular readings and performances of new works culminating in portrait concerts during students' junior and senior years. Undergraduate Composition students have performances of their works by an outstanding variety of department performance groups, students, and faculty.    The Steinhardt graduate program offers two distinct but complementary tracks of study in concert and film music. Students from the two disciplines study side by side and are encouraged to take advantage of these specializations, which are supported by an internationally acclaimed faculty representing diverse styles. Graduate film composers are presented in yearly concerts at venues such as The Walter Reade Theatre in collaboration with The Film Society of Lincoln Center, The National Gallery in Washington D.C., the Tribeca Film Festival and intensive film scoring workshops in collaboration with ASCAP . Graduate concert composers participate in a yearlong course in writing for string quartet, which culminates in a performance of their works by the JACK Quartet in a public New York City venue. In addition they have the opportunity to hear their music in concerts throughout the year as well as on portrait concerts of their works at the end of their second year. All composition students have access to all departments at the university and collaborations with choreographers, visual artists, writers, filmmakers, and scholars in other fields are encouraged.    The faculty includes Robert Rowe, Julia Wolfe, Ron Sadoff, Ira Newborn, Michael Gordon, Justin Dello Joio, Mark Snow, Sonny Kompanek, Mark Suozzo, Youngmi Ha, and Tae Hong Park, among others. Guest composers in the last two years have included Steve Reich, Bruce Broughton, Louis Andriessen, Mark Isham, Meredith Monk, Jimmy Webb, DJ Spooky, Carter Burwell, Uri Caine, Morton Subotnick, Don Byron, Martin Bresnick, and more.    The Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions offers a warm and collegial atmosphere. Compositions students enjoy the support of all of the faculty and their peers. Our reputation, faculty, and location provide students with a unique opportunity to develop as composers and gain an understanding of how to pursue a career in music composition.
