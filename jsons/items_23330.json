A focus on research-informed, direct practice with individuals, groups, and families runs though our entire MSW curriculum.   We also offer emphasis on policy practice for students with community and policy interests, integrated primary and behavioral health care, and global social work practice with opportunities to study abroad. All programs have a strong social justice commitment. Our faculty includes the nation's top scholars who are creating new knowledge for tomorrow's social work practice.   The nationally acclaimed NYU Master of Social Work degree is attainable through three full-time and three part-time programs to meet the needs and interests of our student population. We also offer four dual-degree program options in the areas of child development, global public health, law and management.     MSW assessment findings from the 2009 CSWE EPAS ( PDF ).
