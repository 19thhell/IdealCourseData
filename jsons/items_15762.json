BCE-4th cent. CE). S \u00f6ren Stark soeren.stark@nyu.edu Thursdays, 10:00am \u2013 1:00pm    The boom of Xiongnu archaeology in present-day Mongolia and Buriatia (Russia) during the past two decades has decisively shaped and improved our understanding of Late Iron age nomadic cultures in Eastern Central Asia. Ever since, new data (not least resulting from a more comprehensive application of scientific analyses) and new methodological approaches have considerably stimulated the discussion of aspects such as elite representation between Han China and the \u2018Hellenistic west\u2019, transfer of technologies (in and outside the steppes), or non-elite life-ways among pastoral societies in the area. At the same time, however, we dispose of a considerable mass of older data on nomadic \u2018cultures\u2019 from the territories of the former Soviet-Union, contemporary with the Xiongnu in Mongolia and Buriatia: the so-called \u2018Hunno-Sarmatian horizon\u2019. In many ways, this older data now awaits reconsideration in light of the recent advances in Mongolia and Buriatia. In addition, we see the rapid accumulation of new data from present-day Xinjiang, Gansu and Inner Mongolia (China), pertaining to the same cultural horizon.\u00a0 The aim of our seminar is to re-evaluate older data and to integrate it together with new data into a systematic, regionally structured overview of Late Iron Age pastoral cultures from the trans-Caspian steppes to Inner Mongolia (China), and from Southern Siberia to present-day northern Afghanistan. This will allow us to better understand regional specifics and supra-regional dynamics within and beyond the nomadic world of the \u2018Hunno-Sarmatian horizon\u2019 in an integrated way. And, it is hoped, it will help us to line out potential avenues for future research on pastoral \u2018cultures\u2019 in Central Eurasia during antiquity. Advanced reading knowledge of Russian or Chinese and permission of the instructor is required. \u00a0    ISAW-GA 3010 Art, Archaeology, and Museology Lillian Tseng, Jason Sun lillian.tseng@nyu.edu Thursdays, 2:00-5:00 pm    This seminar explores how museology facilitates the study of art and archaeology through an upcoming special exhibition on the Qin and Han Empires (221 BCE- 220 CE) in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. We will study the objects to be displayed and investigate the characteristics of early imperial Chinese art and archaeology. We will also learn how a museum functions as a cultural institution through the curatorial efforts in acquisitions, exhibitions, and publications, especially how research and diplomacy play significant roles in developing international exhibitions.    Prof. Lillian Tseng at ISAW and Dr. Jason Sun at the Metropolitan Museum of Art will teach the seminar together. The class will take place not only in a seminar room at ISAW but also in the storage rooms of the Museum.    Permission of the instructors required.    ISAW-GA 3013 Astrological Texts in Papyri and Medieval Manuscripts Alexander Jones alexander.jones@nyu.edu Wednesdays 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar will constitute an introduction to the fundamentals of Greco-Roman astrology and its transmission, through the study of selected texts and documents preserved in Greco-Egyptian papyri and medieval manuscripts.    Knowledge of ancient Greek and permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3014 Ritual Text and Ritual Performance in the ANE Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Among other media, culture is constituted and articulated also in cultural performances including ceremonies, festivals, theater, and games. Inspired by theater studies, in the eighties and nineties interdisciplinary research of ethnology, anthropology, religious studies, and historical studies concerned with cultural performance of any kind promoted the\u00a0 performative turn \u00a0by emphasizing the body and bodily action over the thought and mind. This move towards\u00a0 action , i.e. the\u00a0 doing \u00a0of things, entailed a move away from the text. More recently, anthropology and sociology sidestepped these mind/body, thought/action dichotomies by introducing the concept of social drama and emphasizing social interaction. Within the last decade ritual studies have turned towards a more precise definition of ritual versus theater and performance and have reintroduced the complex relationship between text and performance (see the research project\u00a0 Ritualdynamik: Soziokulturelle Prozesse in historischer und kulturvergleichender Perspektive \u00a0at the University of Heidelberg). The seminar\u00a0 Ritual Text and Ritual Performance\u00a0 pursues a similar direction by exploring the various forms of ritual texts transmitted in ancient Near Eastern literature; the relationship between ritual text and ritual performance, i.e. of whether and how far we are allowed to consider cuneiform ritual texts as scripts for the execution of ritual action; the role of narrative for ritual performance; the combination of incantation, prayer, and action within the ritual complex; the\u00a0 memoria -aspect of ritual constituting identity, order, and continuity.    We will combine the reading of primary sources with the theoretical approaches.    Requirements: Knowledge of Akkadian and permission of the instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3018 Archaeology of Anatolia from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic Period Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso lda5@nyu.edu Mondays, 2:00pm-5:00pm    Within Ancient Western Asia the archaeology of Anatolia has a specific position. Separated from Mesopotamia and the Levant by the imposing Tauros Mountains, Anatolia maintained communication, kept up with the developments taking place in the Fertile Crescent, and developed its own peculiar organization of complex group societies. Starting with the Neolithic, the course will explore the archaeological data reflecting the first evidence of social hierarchies and regional power, the development of metallurgy in the EBA, the creation of an empire in the mountains with a territorial organization, and the many and diverse developments and ultimate fall of this empire. We will then go on to look at the remains of then-new kingdoms of Phrygia and Lydia, already in direct contact with archaic Greece, as well as the impact of the Achaemenid conquest, up to the Hellenistic period. The course will offer an overview of the most important historical and archaeological themes connected with the ancient history of Anatolia; for each period, one key Anatolian site will presented with the scope to make students familiar with the relation between theory, historical reconstruction, and the rough archaeological data on which they are based.    Permission of the instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3020 The Discovery of Iranian Antiquity Daniel T. Potts daniel.potts@nyu.edu \u00a0 Tuesdays, 9am \u2013 12:00pm    The invention of printing in the late 15 th \u00a0century, coupled with increased traffic between European capitals and the Safavid court in the 16 th \u00a0and 17 th \u00a0centuries, resulted in a growth of interest in Iran\u2019s pre-Islamic past. Europeans visited major sites like Persepolis, Pasargadae and Naqsh-e Rustam; compared their situations with accounts in Classical sources; copied inscriptions; and brought portable antiquities back to their homelands. Enlightenment scholars (philologists, antiquarians, numismatists) of the 18 th \u00a0century worked assiduously on this material and established a substantial baseline of knowledge that served as a springboard for the better-known investigations, both archaeological and historical, of the 19 th \u00a0century. This course will look at what early modern Europeans contributed to the growth of Iranology.    Prerequisites: very good reading knowledge of French and German (ability to read Gothic script is an advantage). Permission of the instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3023 Mapping and Data Visualization for the Ancient World Sebastian Heath sh1933@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 10:00am -1:00pm    This course considers tools and methods for the effective communication of scholarly research through data-driven maps and the visualization of small and large datasets. By frequent hands-on use and demonstration of their work, students will gain confidence in using web-based tools as well as software that runs directly on their own computers. A constant focus will be the ability of such tools and software to import and export data in standard formats and to enable sharing of the maps and visualizations that students create. Accordingly, students will gain expertise in data interchange formats such as the Javascript Object Notation (JSON). Topics stressed over the course of the term will include the temporal component of spatial data as well as connectivity within data sets. We will also survey current approaches to the application of digital methods to historical and archaeological research and teaching. A particular outcome for students will be the ability to assess the relevance of both current and future tools for their own work. The majority of our examples will come from the ancient world as ISAW defines it, though students with other interests can enroll. It is expected that students will bring their own computers to class. While there are no prerequisites, participants should be willing to commit considerable time to rapidly gaining the technical skills that will be presented in class.    Permission of instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3003-001 Directed Study: Hittite Texts Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso lda5@nyu.edu Thursdays, 5:00-7:00pm (6 th \u00a0Floor Large Conference Room)    Hittite, the earliest Indo-European language, is attested on cuneiform tablets, and was created as a means of recording numerous and various types of information collected by the royal court of Hattusa, and by some other administrative centers on the periphery of the Great Kingdom of Hatti. In some cases different types of information were recorded in different textual genres, and because of cuneiform schooling it is not rare that different genres used a wider or more restricted number of cuneiform signs, values, as well as a different vocabulary, formulary or phrasary. The course aims at introducing the participants to the different types of texts written in Hittite. Each lesson will be devoted to transcription and translation of ca. 30 lines of one \u2018genre\u2019. Thus, a sample from the Hittite Laws, letters, treaties, edicts, annals, prayers, rituals, feasts, oracular inquiries, inventories, poems and mythic narratives will be transcribed and translated along the semester, and for each text genre a piece of secondary literature about form and/or content of the genre will be discussed by the class.    Prerequisites: an introductory course of Hittite Language (Hittite I) and permission of the instructor.    Fall Seminars 2014    The Exact Sciences in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages Alexander Jones Mondays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm alexander.jones@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3002    In this seminar we will examine episodes in the circulation of scientific knowledge and practices in the Mediterranean world (broadly conceived) from the third century CE to the end of the first millennium. The approach will be primarily through study of original texts, some of which will be chosen according to the specific interests and expertise of participants.    Knowledge of one or more of the relevant ancient languages (Greek in particular, Latin, Arabic, ...) is required. Permission of the instructor required.    Late Antique Documents Roger Bagnall Mondays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm roger.bagnall@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3007    The seminar will examine a series of papyrus archives from late antique Egypt and Palestine, mostly in Greek but with some documents partly or entirely in Latin, Coptic, and Arabic. The archives will range from villages to cities, private to public, and secular to monastic. Readings will be mostly of primary documents but also some modern discussions of the archives. The central focuses will be on the formation of what we call archives, their potential for historical study, and their limitations.    A reading knowledge of Greek and either French or German is required. Permission of the instructor required.    Art, Archaeology and Material Culture Lillian Tseng Wednesdays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm lillian.tseng@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010    This seminar explores various approaches that help us understand and elaborate the unearthed objects of extraordinary craftsmanship, a large corpus of fascinating material that has not yet been fully studied by archaeologists or art historians. The seminar seeks to strike a balance between methodological reflections and case studies. Theories and examples to be investigated are not limited to any specific cultural area.  Permission of the instructor required.    Early Chinese Literary Manuscripts Adam Schwartz Fridays, 1:00 \u2013 4:00pm acs21@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3012    This text-reading course will introduce the major corpora of newly discovered Early Chinese literary manuscripts and the philological methods fundamental to work with them.\u00a0 Readings will be from the Zhou through the Han, with focus on Warring States genre and popular readership, provincial scripts and stationery.    Permission of the instructor required.    Greek and Roman Portraiture Hallie Franks Mondays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm hmf2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013    This course will engage with critical issues that surround the study of ancient portraiture traditions in the Greek and Roman worlds. Some of the questions we will address over the course of the semester include: How do modern assumptions about the function and genre of portraiture, and its relationship to the subject, impact approaches to ancient material?\u00a0How do we develop a vocabulary for the different potential relationships between subject and visual product?\u00a0How do we think about intent, and what kinds of material provide context for interpretation?\u00a0How do portraits serve in public or private roles in different ways?\u00a0How can we use traditions of portraiture to think about ancient concepts of and expressions of various identities? This course deals primarily with classical material, but it also involves critical engagement with and analysis of the visual and the processes of contextualization.    Permission of the instructor required.    Advanced Reading of Akkadian: The Political and Cultural Relations between Assur and Babylon Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014-001    In addition to consolidating the knowledge of Akkadian grammar the Advanced Reading of Akkadian Class is designed to introduce into various dialects of Akkadian from a diversity of regions and periods and to familiarize the student with a diversity of paleographies as well as text categories. The text corpus to be studied will include royal inscriptions, letters, letters from gods to the king, and chronicles.    At least one year of Akkadian is required. Permission of the instructor required.    Advanced Reading of Akkadian: Incantations, Prayers, and Rituals Beate Pongratz-Leisten Thursdays 11:00am \u2013 1:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014-002    In addition to consolidating the knowledge of Akkadian grammar the Advanced Reading of Akkadian Class is designed to introduce into various dialects of Akkadian from a diversity of regions and periods and to familiarize the student with a diversity of paleographies as well as text categories. The text corpus to be studied will include incantations, prayers, and rituals from Ebla, Kanesh, Emar in Northern Syria as well as Assyrian and Babylonian cities.    At least one year of Akkadian. Permission of the instructor required.    Peoples and Lands of the Zagros: From Gutium to Ellipi Daniel T. Potts Tuesdays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm dtp2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3018    This seminar will examine the native peoples and regions of the Zagros mountain regions (Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Luristan) from their first appearance in cuneiform sources of the third millennium BC to the end of the Assyrian/Neo-Elamite period. Principle groups and regions that will be considered include Gutium, Simurrum, Lullubum, the Turukkaeans, Mannaea and Ellipi. The role of Ur III, Kassite, Assyrian and Urartian territorial ambitions in the region will be investigated as well as the nature of the landscape and the groups that inhabited it through time.    No formal requirements, but good reading knowledge of German and French would be helpful. Permission of the instructor required.    The Transition from Late Antiquity to Early Islam Robert Hoyland Tuesdays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm rgh2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3020-001    This course focuses on the question of what changed and what did not change in Near Eastern society in the course of the fifth to ninth centuries AD. \u00a0Consideration will be given to both the micro level (individual objects, themes, groups etc) and the macro level (was Pirenne right about the disruptive nature of the Arab conquests, is Becker's characterization of Islam as the culmination of late antique culture apt, etc). and to literary and archaeological themes and sources.    Permission of the instructor required.    The Body in the Ancient World Claire Bubb Wednesdays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm claire.coiro@gmail.com ISAW-GA 3020-002    This seminar will consider ancient understanding of and attitudes towards the human body. Our primary goal will be to trace the shifting conceptions of human physiology from Egyptian medical papyri to the Arabic tradition, with a heavy focus on the Greeks and Romans. How did cultures with strong taboos around the body form theories about the organs hidden within it? How did the ancients grapple with the brain, the nervous system, and the interrelationship of the soul and the body? How did the concept of the humors develop and what were the rival theories? How close did the Greeks come to understanding blood and the circulatory system and why did they miss its circular nature? Why did Galen\u2019s physiology come to dominate Western thought for centuries after his death, and how did the Arabic authors responsible for much of its transmission receive and respond to his theories? In order to understand the cultural context behind the development and evolution of these theories, we will also briefly consider religious, literary, and artistic treatment of the body, including burial customs, the centrality of the body to early Christianity, and the fascination with the body revealed across literary genres, particularly rhetoric and the novels.    Permission of the instructor required.    Spring 2014 Seminars \u00a0    Perspectives on the Ancient World in Medieval Islamic Histories Robert Hoyland Thursdays 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm rgh2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3020    In this course we will read from the works of a number of Muslim historians in order to ascertain their attitude, and that of Islamic civilization at large, towards the ancient world. \u00a0The aim will be to explore how the Islamic world situated itself with respect to past civilizations, why it favoured some past peoples over others, and how the forces of Time, Fate and God's will played a part in the evanescence of the past.    Arabic and permission of the instructor required.    Wall Paintings in Central Asia S\u00f6ren Stark &amp; Fiona Kidd Mondays 5:00 \u2013 8:00pm soeren.stark@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3009    Wall paintings constitute, since the 1 st millennium BCE, at least one of the major means employed to decorate architectural spaces of various sorts \u2013 religious (temples, monasteries), communal-palatial, private dwellings, tombs, etc. \u2013 throughout Central Asia. As such, murals constitute, in particular for the pre-Islamic period, one of the main categories of visual arts at our disposal. Yet wall paintings are not only significant for the study of art history in pre-Islamic Central Asia: in fact \u2013 and considering the near complete loss of other visual materials such as textile wall hangings and illuminated books, and the general scarcity of written sources \u2013 murals constitute a critical source for our understanding of the religious, social, economic and sometimes even political history of the area before the advent of Islam.    This class aims at a comprehensive overview of the most important sites and architectural ensembles with substantial wall painting remains in the area. Chronologically they range from the final centuries BCE to the 9 th /10 th century CE. Geographically we will focus on the regions of Choresmia, Sogdiana, Bactria-Tokh\u0101rist\u0101n and the Tarim basin. This will allow us to review difficult and still much-debated questions concerning the production of wall paintings in Central Asia. Those include questions regarding the significance of regional styles as evidence for regional schools and itinerant workshops, the social and economic background of artists and patrons, ways of transfer of artistic models, and regional variances regarding cultural preferences in elite representation.    Permission of the instructor required.    Literature and the Question of Genre in the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014    In the last decades the category of \u2018literature\u2019 in the Ancient Near East has come repeatedly under scrutiny. It included among other topics fierce discussions about how to define the literary corpus, orality and aurality, the notion of genre, the validity of historical references in literary works and the fluid boundaries between \u2018literature\u2019 and \u2018historiography,\u2019 where to locate literary production - school, temple, or palace, and how far the production process determined functional and pragmatic aspects of literary works.    To isolate literature from its historical context as l\u2019art pour l\u2019art aesthetics favoring formalistic features over pragmatic and historical concerns certainly does not do justice to ancient literary works. While formalistic features such as the use of literary dialects might operate as a way of categorization, recently, due to the nature of the texts, narratology as well as fictionality have been considered equally important. Literature rather should be defined as a particular medium alongside other media as part of the social and cultural discourse. Moreover, what makes an oeuvre historically significant, is not necessarily established by the qualities of the work or by the author but by its history of reception and its intertextuality and intermediality. The seminar investigates what constituted literary works, how literary works became part of the stream of tradition, were affected by and affected historical conditions, and entered intertextual and intermedial relations.    Knowledge of Akkadian and permission of the instructor required.    Dilmun, Magan, and Meluhha Daniel T. Potts **This is a condensed seminar. The class will meet twice a week from January 27 \u2013 March 18; Mondays 1-4pm and Tuesdays 9am-12pm** dtp2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3018    Third millennium cuneiform sources refer to three lands associated with the 'Lower Sea' (Persian Gulf): Dilmun, in the northern and central Gulf, centered on Bahrain, the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and Failak (Kuwait); Magan, in the Oman peninsula; and Meluhha, conventionally identified with the Harappan civilization in the Indus Valley. In this seminar we will examine the archaeological and cuneiform sources from and about this region, paying particular attention to the period c. 6000 BC to the 1st century AD. The seminar will emphasize local developments in the region, including both funerary and settlement data, and evidence of inter-regional contact (ceramics, stone vessels, metals, semi-precious stones).    Permission of the instructor required.    Greco-Roman Astrology and Astronomy and the Antecedents Alexander Jones Mondays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm alexander.jones@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3002    This seminar will be an introduction to the goals, methods, and practices of Greek mathematical astronomy during the period from the second century BCE through the second century CE (essentially from Hipparchus to Ptolemy) and to the Greco-Roman astrology that depended on this astronomy. Sources will include texts transmitted via medieval manuscripts (e.g. Ptolemy's works in Greek and Arabic), papyri, and presumed adaptations of Greek astronomy and astrology in other traditions such as those of India. Particular attention will be paid to the Greek reception and modification of elements of astronomy and astrology from Mesopotamia and Egypt.    Knowledge of Greek or other languages significant for these traditions and permission of the instructor required.    Landscapes and Territoriality in Western and Eastern Asia BCE Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Roderick Campbell Wednesdays 9:30am \u2013 12:30pm lda5@nyu.edu , rbc2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3012    How is place and landscape conceived in times and places before nation states, maps and national borders? What, if any, notions of territoriality were in operation in ancient polities like the Shang kingdom at Anyang or the Neo-Hittite polities of Anatolia? How are they linked to such concepts as community, town/city, and land? And on the other hand, how do modern scholars reconstruct landscapes and territoriality of ancient polities?    The course will approach these and similar questions dividing between classes on theory where some basic methodological contributions are discussed, and classes devoted to case studies, where specific aspects are dealt with in well-defined historical context.    At lease one foreign language and permission of the instructor required. \u00a0    Early Chinese Epigraphy: Bones, Bronze, and Bamboo Roderick Campbell and Adam Schwartz Thursdays 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm rbc2@nyu.edu , acs21@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010    In this course students will acquire a foundation in epigraphic methodology and work through a selection of epigraphic texts from Shang through Warring States times. Fundamental epigraphic training will include an understanding of the basic principles of Chinese graph formation as well as the fundamentals of phonological, morphological and syntactic reconstruction. Consideration of writing media, context and register will also be addressed. Familiarity with corpus access (through compendium, on-line databases, etc.) and resources (dictionaries, concordances, etc.) will form part of the training on each corpus discussed. The main corpuses of excavated texts will be Shang oracle-bone inscriptions, Shang and Western Zhou bronze inscriptions, and Eastern Zhou bamboo slips. We will attempt to cover a wide range of genres with an eye to giving students as broad a paleographic base as possible.    Coursework will consist of weekly assignments \u2013 usually in the form of translations and preparation to read specific texts in common. The final course assignment will be the annotated translation of a text of reasonable size and complexity.    Ability to read classical Chinese and permission of instructors required. \u00a0    Maps, Models, and Databases: Digital Tools for the Ancient World Sebastian Heath Wednesdays 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm sebastian.heath@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013    Our goal in this course is to gain hands-on skills with the digital tools that are changing the nature of research and the publication of scholarship related to the Ancient World. The focus is material culture and throughout the term students will work with free tools that enable sharing of results. Students will not only learn how to make 3D models of objects in museum collections, but also how to choose open formats that let one publish those models on the Internet. Google Maps and Earth will play a prominent role, and students will also use the more capable web-based GIS CartoDB ( http://cartodb.com ). A goal will always be to explore how these tools can work together to make innovative presentations of scholarly research. Other topics include the role of open licenses in modern scholarship, database structures appropriate for capturing the heterogeneity of ancient material culture, network analysis, the geographic component of ancient primary sources, and the deployment of Linked Open Data. Throughout the term students will evaluate both cloud-based tools and downloadable software, while also reviewing websites and digital publications that provide access to important resources. Students will gain an ability to use current tools as well as the confidence to assess new tools as they become available in the future. This course will be of particular interest to students needing to incorporate digital manifestations of material culture into their dissertations or other scholarly work. \u00a0    Fall 2013 Seminars \u00a0    Public Health in the Ancient World Roger Bagnall and Roderick Campbell Mondays 2:00-5:00 p.m. roger.bagnall@nyu.edu ; rbc2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3022    Revolutionary developments in the biological sciences, accompanied as well by discoveries in the physical sciences, have opened up possibilities for study of the human past unimaginable a generation ago. To long-established methods dependent on description and quantification have been added technologies that allow us to find out, for example, whether people buried at Rome were also born and raised there, or what kind of carbohydrates dwellers of an Egyptian oasis were eating. The routes of transmission of plant species can be seen as never before; modern demographic techniques like model life tables have given new life to ancient demography, once a laughingstock; scientific excavation of arid sites coupled with new technologies has produced information on morbidity and mortality unobtainable until now. We have now the opportunity to begin to put together a comprehensive sense of the factors of health over the vast span of human history we call antiquity, while at the same time study changing, collective human responses to disease, nutrition, risk and ultimately, mortality.    This course will have a symposium format with different specialists each week presenting on a range of topics from paleopathology to ancient demography. In addition to weekly response papers students will write a final paper relating one or more of the symposium\u2019s topics to the overarching theme of public health in the ancient world.    Permission of the instructor required.    Iranian Archaeology in the 21 st Century Daniel T. Potts Tuesdays 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm daniel.potts@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3018    The publication of recent excavations (post-2000) in journals like Iran , Iranica Antiqua and Arch\u00e4ologische Mitteilungen aus Iran und Turan , as well as in monographs and conference volumes (published inside and outside of Iran) has resulted in a significant addition to our knowledge of Iranian archaeology in all periods of the pre-Islamic past. Accessing that new data and integrating it with what was already known is not always easy, however. This seminar will involve close reading of the past 13 years of scholarship in Iranian archaeology with an emphasis on primary publications of excavations and museum collections (rather than secondary literature). The aim will be to evaluate this new material and assess how it fits in with what was already known about the relevant site, region and/or period; consider where it challenges previous beliefs; and discuss what new questions it raises.    Permission of the instructor required.    Hittite History, Language &amp; Archaeology Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso Mondays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm lda5@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013    The Hittite empire had a profound impact on the history of Pre-classical Western Asia. After a period defined by the presence of local principalities, and a formative phase in the 17 th century, a complex political machine developed in Central Anatolia. The creation of a system of large structures for containment of water and seeds allowed local societies to overcome for the first time the regional challenges resulting from the weather and landscape. These important structures are part of a comprehensive approach to complex social life, whose effects became concretely observable in the so-called Early Empire. In this period, for example, normative texts were produced, some defining the administrative function of the capital and peripheral districts, some \u2013what we call rituals and feasts-, defining the cultic activity between the core to the periphery, and the syncretic pantheon. The tension between the \u201c possible empire \u201d emerging from these texts and the local developments produced by various actors can be understood through the lens of the historical context in which the empire operated for almost 500 years. The course aims at providing participants with basic information and updated research on the Hittites. Each class will be divided into two parts: one touching different themes of the history and archaeology of the Hittites; the other providing an introduction into the Hittite language and script.    Participation 30%; one presentation during course 40%; final written exam 30% (no final paper)    Requirements: one foreign language: either French, Italian or German    Permission of the instructor required.    Introduction to GIS &amp; Spatial Analysis in Anthropology &amp; Archaeology Emily Hammer Wednesdays 9:30am \u2013 12:30pm ehammer@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3012 \u2013 Class takes place at 24 Waverly Place, Rm. 668    This course aims to provide a basic understanding of how remote sensing data (satellite imagery and aerial\u00a0photographs) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to visualize, analyze, and integrate\u00a0archaeological, anthropological, historical, environmental, and hydrological data. \u00a0It also aims to introduce students to the process\u00a0of designing and carrying out a spatial research project. \u00a0Students will learn basic techniques for acquiring,\u00a0manipulating, and creating geospatial data in several forms, including pixel-based satellite imagery and digital\u00a0terrain models as well as point, line, and polygon representations of data. \u00a0Each week, these techniques will be\u00a0applied to sample archaeological data and also to data from a region/topic chosen by the student. \u00a0In addition to lab-based work, students will learn basic field techniques of field survey, including how to navigate and record using a\u00a0Global Positioning System (GPS) handheld receiver, how to integrate GPS data into a GIS database, and how to\u00a0produce maps for fieldwork and publication. \u00a0The course will use ESRI's ArcGIS software.    Permission of the instructor required.    Time in Greco-Roman Antiquity: Texts and Material Culture Alexander Jones Thursdays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm alexander.jones@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3002    In the ancient Greek and Roman world time was initially flexible, inexact, and tied to the natural environment. The risings and settings of the Sun, the phases of the Moon, and the cycle of the seasons supplied the basic framework of days, months, and years by which people organized daily life, commerce, religion, and government. However, astronomers, mathematicians, mechanicians, and scholars developed increasingly precise ways of measuring, organizing, and keeping track of time. This seminar will investigate the varied technologies and practices of time management known from textual sources and artifacts, and the interaction between the development of these technologies and practices and the awareness and representation of measured time in Greco-Roman society.    Permission of the instructor required.    Advanced Reading of Akkadian - Literary Texts in Ancient Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014    This course is intended to provide an insight into the corpus of literary texts of Mesopotamia. It includes a mix of poems, epics, and myths, the Agushaya Hymn, Tukulti-Ninurta Epic, the Erra Epic, Anzu Myth and Etana Myth, just to name a few. Most of these texts come in various versions from different periods thus allowing for investigating their transmission through time. They are written in the Hymnic-Epical Dialect or the Standard Babylonian dialect. Consequently, beyond acquiring knowledge of great Mesopotamian literary works, the students will train in reading these literary dialects. At least one year of Akkadian is required.    Permission of the instructor required.    Spring 2013 Seminars \u00a0    Transmission of Ancient Science into Arabic Robert Hoyland Thursdays 2:00 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3002 rgh2@nyu.edu    The aim of this course is to explore the different paths along which knowledge of Antiquity passed into Muslim intellectual culture and how it was received and interpreted. \u00a0The focus will not just be on the so-called translation movement, but also the broader question of how pre-Islamic histories and cultures fared in the Middle East after the Arab conquests. \u00a0A core part of the course will be reading original Arabic texts and assessment will be via a final paper that must involve study of extracts from Arabic texts.    Permission of the instructor required.    Greek Texts on Mechanics Alexander Jones Mondays 1:00 p.m. \u2013 4:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3007 alexander.jones@nyu.edu    A selection of Greek mechanical texts, including Pappus of Alexandria's \"Introduction to Mechanics\" (Book 8 of his Synagoge ) and Heronian works from the \"Mynas Codex\" ( Par. suppl. gr. 607) will be studied on the basis of medieval manuscripts, with particular attention to the manuscript diagrams.    Knowledge of ancient Greek is required. Permission of the instructor required.    \u201cSoghdians in their Homeland\u201d \u2013 the Archaeology of Soghdia from ca. 600 BCE to ca. 750 CE S\u00f6ren Stark Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 2:00 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m; March 26 \u2013 May 9 ISAW-GA 3009 soeren.stark@nyu.edu    Spectacular finds and a general interest in Old World connectivity has in recent years sparkled much interest in Soghdians abroad, in particular in their colonies along the so-called Silk Roads and in the Chinese plains. Much less attention has been paid, outside a small scholarly circle, to their homeland at the banks of the rivers Zerafshan and Kashka-Darya (in present-day Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) \u2013 with the result that the discussion of \u201cSoghdians along the Silk Roads and in China\u201d is often based on too imprecise (sometimes even wrong) assumptions about their \u2018original\u2019 cultural traditions.    Particularly regrettable is a certain tendency to use the term \u201cSoghdian\u201d almost in a generic way, subsuming everything \u201cIranian\u201d east of the Iranian plateau under one fashionable label. This seminar aims for some clarification on this issue by systematically and comprehensively assessing our current knowledge on the archaeology of Soghdia, from the dawn of constitutive cultural features in the region during the pre-Achaemenid Iron Age to the incorporation of Soghdia into the Dar al-Islam in the course of the 8th century. The approach will be micro-regional, that is we will follow the main trends of development regarding settlement patterns, site typology, architecture, ceramic, metal and textile production, as well as burial costumes and visual arts for each micro-region separately \u2013 as far as possible. This is an ambitious aim that has not been undertaken in a systematic way. As a result, it is hoped, we will be able to not only distinguish more precisely \u201cSoghdian\u201d cultural features from those associated with Khorezmia, Ferghana, Bactria or Sasanian Iran, but also to perceive intra-regional variations and trends.    This seminar is held intensively from March 26 th \u2013 May 9 th . Russian and permission of the instructor is required.    The Art of Antiquity in the Metropolitan Museum: A Global Perspective Lillian Tseng/Paul Zanker Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 3:00pm-6:00pm January 29 - March 14 ISAW-GA 3012 lillian.tseng@nyu.edu    This seminar explores the collections of Ancient art in the Metropolitan Museum with a global perspective. It seeks to clarify the distinct features of art objects produced in the Greco-Roman World and in Early China through contrast and comparison. Mediums to be studied range from sculpture, pictorial arts to decorative arts. Topics to be discussed include heroes, deities, mythology, auspiciousness, monumentality, and femininity.    The seminar encourages students to establish direct connections with objects. All classes meet in the galleries or storerooms of the Museum. The seminar is led by Lillian Tseng and Paul Zanker. Dr. Zanker is the author of Roman Art (J. Paul Getty Museum, 2010) and Pompeii: Public and Private Life (Harvard University Press, 1998).    This seminar is held intensively from January 29 th to March 14 th . The first class meets in the lecture hall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. No languages are required.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Beyond Apogee and Collapse: Empires and other Polities in the Ancient World (BCE) Roderick Campbell/Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso Fridays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3013 rbc2@nyu.edu , lda5@nyu.edu    \u201cThe fall of the Assyrian empire\u201d; \u201cthe collapse of the Mayan civilization\u201d \u2013 the idea of collapse fascinates the contemporary imagination, conjuring images of melancholy ruins and vanished civilizations. The apogee of empires is what is generally contrasted with the post-collapse situation, but what of everything in between? When researchers detach their gaze from successful military deeds, or abrupt changes in the archaeological record, a sort of skepticism on the consistence and the sense of ancient polities occurs, and lower scale social organization \u2013urban, kin, or primary production based, appears as the main \u2018real\u2019 elements defining the scenario.    The course will discuss how empires and other polities of the ancient world (4 th to 1 st millennium BCE) operate over the long-term. \u00a0On the basis of more recent studies, it will reconsider the concepts of \u201capogee\u201d and \u201ccollapse\u201d as embedded in a more dynamic understanding of historical processes. These and similar questions about the nature and functioning of ancient political forms over time will be the focus of the seminar, divided in a group of classes on theoretic approaches, followed by a series of case studies.    SYLLABUS    Permission of the instructor is required.    Arabia in Antiquity c. 3500 BCE \u2013 750 CE George Hatke Tuesdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3018 geh2@nyu.edu    While ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Syria-Palestine have been the subject of scholarly investigation for the better part of two centuries, the Arabian Peninsula remains an understudied region by historians and archaeologists alike. This results not only from the difficulties of traveling to, and conducting research in, Arabia, but also from a long-standing view that ancient Arabia was little more than a peripheral region of the Near East whose nomadic tribes periodically migrated into more northerly regions but which had little history of its own.    This seminar seeks to demonstrate that, far from being peripheral to the ancient Near East, the Arabian Peninsula was in fact an axis of the Near Eastern, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean worlds and must therefore be considered an integral part of antiquity. From this broader perspective, such developments in ancient Arabian history as the diffusion of Semitic languages, the rise of state societies, the growth of long-distance trade, and ultimately the spread of monotheistic tradition(s) will be studied against the backdrop of the political, social, economic, and cultural history of the ancient world at large. In this way students of antiquity will learn how to interpret and evaluate evidence for contact between cultures, using the Arabian Peninsula as a case study. Particular emphasis will be placed on three key regions of Arabia: 1) South Arabia and the Red Sea, 2) East Arabia and the Persian/Arabian Gulf, and 3) the desert frontier of the Fertile Crescent that constitutes North Arabia. The timeframe of the seminar extends from the Early Bronze Age (beginning in the mid-fourth millennium BCE) to the Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE).    Among the questions that will be dealt with in this seminar are: 1) What role did agriculture and trade play in ancient Arabian society, and what evidence survives of these two facets of the Arabian economy? 2) To what extent were ancient Arabian politics shaped by external political and economic factors? How and why did some foreign polities (e.g. the Ethiopian kingdom of Aksum and the S\u0101s\u0101nid Empire of Iran) establish spheres of influence while no Arabian polity expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula until the seventh century CE? 3) Who were the Arabs and what made them different from other Arabian peoples? Is it possible to speak of the Arabs as a single, coherent group in pre-Islamic times? 4) How did monotheistic traditions reshape Arabian society during Late Antiquity (c. 200-700 CE)? Why did Islam emerge when it did, and why in Arabia, as opposed to another desert region like the Sahara?    Permission of the instructor required.    Relations between Mesopotamia &amp; Iran Daniel T. Potts Wednesdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3019 kel306@nyu.edu    This seminar will consider a variety of issues in the archaeology of Mesopotamia and Iran from late prehistory through the end of the Bronze Age. Some of those issues will be examined in a synchronic fashion while others will be investigated diachronically. Accounting for changes in material culture and cultural practices, as well as continuities, is a constant theme in much archaeological research, sometimes centering around specific domains of material culture or cultural activity, sometimes taking a more global approach. This year\u2019s seminar will examine a range of different issues diachronically. The intention is to initiate a discussion around the role of technology and demography as variables which impact upon the continuities and changes that are attested in a number of different domains.    This course poses a series of key questions of a series of cultural domains and practices attested in Mesopotamia and Iran (6 th -2 rd millennia BC), with a view to charting structural continuities and discontinuities through time. The appropriateness of technological and social explanations of these phenomena will be discussed and evaluated.    Knowledge of French and/or German required. Permission of the instructor required.    The History of Assyria in Ancient and Modern Historiography Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3020 bpl2@nyu.edu    This seminar is not geared towards an event-oriented history of Assyria. Its also not concerned with the social science oriented history including quantitative sociological and economic history modeled after the natural sciences and its claim for objective truth. Rather than a history from below, the emphasis is on the study of the textual production as it related to or occurred at the Assyrian courts throughout their history and on how ancient historiography proceeded from facts or empirical events to create a coherent story about the deeds of the king that met the expectations linked with the office of rulership, which were informed by a longstanding tradition and the world view of the time. We will educate ourselves as to how to interpret the various text genres that Assyriologists have classified as chronicles and annals by critically re-evaluating our modern taxonomy applied to the ancient texts and explore how these \u2018genres\u2019 interface with what we tend to subsume under fiction and literature. In addition to such critical attitude toward the text, informed by postmodern literary theory and linguistics, linguistic features of the ancient texts and the shape of the tablet as well as the context of the text will illuminate our interpretation of the ancients\u2019 intentionality. We will explore to what degree the writings were indeed concerned with the past, what the inserting of \u2018historical factual data\u2019 was aiming at and further critically evaluate the assumption that history needs always to be written in a narrative.    The goal of the seminar is threefold: 1) to familiarize ourselves with the various text categories, 2) to acquire knowledge in the various dialects of the Assyrian language as well as in the \u2018hymnic epical dialect\u2019 by reading primary sources related to the general discussion and 3) to acquire an insight into the cultural and intellectual setting in which historiography was written by the ancient scholars for the political elites.    The reading of Akkadian texts related to the seminar will be complemented by a further tutorial on Thursday 11AM - 1PM.    As in former years the seminar will be concluded with a workshop. This year\u2019s participants:\u00a0 Jean-Jacques Glassner; Peter Machinist; Piotr Michalowski, and Nele Ziegler. Akkadian is required for those who attend the reading sessions.    Permission of the instructor required.    Pottery and Empire in the Roman Mediterranean Sebastian Heath Wednesdays 2:00 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3021 sebastian.heath@nyu.edu    This course surveys the types of pottery available in the Roman-period Mediterranean and encourages students to consider how that material contributes to the study of large-scale economic and political history, as well as its contribution to focused questions of individual consumer experience and the interpretation of specific archaeological contexts. Students will gain familiarity with the basic vocabulary and techniques of ceramic study while always asking why this material is important to understanding the Roman Empire. The majority of the readings concern the Eastern Mediterranean, but we will consider the Mediterranean as a unit.\u00a0 Some titles in the required readings are drawn from fields entirely outside the ancient Mediterranean. Students will be able to explore specific regions or issues within the study of Roman pottery in their research paper.    Permission of the instructor required.    Fall 2012 Seminars     Introduction to Papyrology    Roger Bagnall Tuesdays 2:00-5:00 p.m. roger.bagnall@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3007    This seminar will introduce students to both technical and substantive sides of papyrology. It will read a representative selection of published papyri from the Hellenistic, Roman, and Late Antique periods, with an emphasis on the interpretive challenges posed by documentary evidence; and students will learn to decipher Greek handwritings and prepare a critical edition of a papyrus.    A knowledge of Greek is required; Latin and Coptic would be useful, and there will be readings in French and German. Permission of the professor is required.    Conceptions of Ethnicity in the Ancient World Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Soeren Stark Wednesdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. lda5@nyu.edu , soeren.stark@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3009    The problem of ethnicity is a recurring and widely discussed topic in studies related to a wide range of pre-modern societies and cultures. Historical conceptions, rooted in national movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have taken for granted that terms like \u201cpeople\u201d, \u201ctribe\u201d, etc. refer to racially and culturally homogeneous groups, sharing a common descendance and destiny, speaking the same language and living within one state. In this way, \u201cpeoples\u201d (and not individuals or social groups) were seen as something immutable, almost as a natural rather than a historical phenomenon.    Although the ideological origins of these conceptions are now common knowledge, \u201cethnicity\u201d in pre-modern societies remains a much-debated issue. One of the most pertinent questions is whether an \u201cethnic\u201d identity existed and, if so, how it differs from other group identities. Other core questions to be discussed in the seminar are \u201cethnic identity\u201d and the concept of \u201ccultural memory\u201d, \u201cethnic identity and the archaeological record\u201d, \u201cethnicity and name-giving\u201d and \u201cethnicity and migrations\u201d. The seminar approaches these problems from a cross-cultural perspective, drawing on cases from the Ancient Near East to the Early Medieval Steppes in Inner Eurasia.    Reading will be in English and German. Permission of the professor is required.    Redrawing the Map: Art &amp; Archaeology of Northeast Asia in the First Millennium CE Sarah Laursen Thursdays 2:00-5:00 p.m. sarah.laursen@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010    This seminar will investigate the interrelationships between the arts of China, Korea, and Japan in the first millennium CE. We will first identify the historical political borders between these regions, and then compare them to the evidence provided by the material record. Key themes of ethnicity, religious affiliation, and the transfer of technology will be explored through case studies, such as the wall paintings in China\u2019s Han dynasty tombs, the shimmering gold jewelry of Korea\u2019s Three Kingdoms period, and the surviving traditional architecture of Japan\u2019s Asuka and Nara periods.    Chinese, Korean, or Japanese reading knowledge preferred. Permission of the professor is required.    Genealogies of the State: Polities in the Ancient World Roderick Campbell Wednesdays 2:00-5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3012 rbc2@nyu.edu    What is an \"ancient state\"? What assumptions about history are packed into the often heard but seldom explained phrase, \"state level society\"? In the first half this course we will explore the intellectual history of \"the state\" from early modern to 21st century theorists and the rise of the concept of \"the ancient state\" in 20th century archaeology. Armed with a genealogy of the state concept we will then turn to case studies of ancient polities and empires from antiquity. The case studies will be presented by a series of leading experts brought in as guest speakers.    This course will be reading intensive and interdisciplinary. There will likely be a contingent of faculty and post-docs as well as graduate students. Graduate students of disparate disciplines with an interest in deep-time political development are welcome. Prerequisites are interest, industry and imagination.    Permission of the professor is required.    Art &amp; Archaeology of Early Medieval China Lillian Tseng Mondays 2:00\u20135:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3013 lillian.tseng@nyu.edu    This seminar surveys diverse visual and material cultures from the 3rd to the 6 th centuries in China, a historical period marked by political division and ethnic integration. We will examine both transmitted and excavated objects, with special attention to their historical and archaeological contexts. Issues to discuss include ideology, identity, gender, and cultural interaction. Mediums to explore range from calligraphy, painting, architecture, sculpture, to ceramics, silverware, and glassware.    Reading knowledge of modern Chinese is required. Permission of the professor is required.    The Arab Conquests and the Worlds of Late Antiquity: Arabization, Arabicization, and Islamization Robert Hoyland Thursdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3014 kel306@nyu.edu    This course will examine the interaction between the Arab conquerors and the late antique worlds that they encountered.\u00a0 It will do so principally through the lens of contemporaries and near contemporaries rather than through that of ninth- and tenth-century Muslims, as is the usual practice.\u00a0 This is crucial for gaining a better understanding of the Middle East as it was when the Arabs first arrived in it as conquerors instead of as it came to be after a couple of centuries of their rule.\u00a0 A considerable amount of attention will be paid to the various polities that existed shortly prior to the conquests - the kingdoms of the Romanised Berbers, Nubians, Caucasian Albanians, Soghdians, Gurjarans etc - and the different ways in which they dealt with the invaders.    Spring 2012 Seminars \u00a0    Archaeologies of Production / Traditions of Making: Ancient China and Beyond Roderick Campbell Fridays 2:00 - 5:00 p.m. rbc2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010.001    This seminar will focus on an interdisciplinary study of production and the making of things in Early China using case studies from China as well as other parts of the world for comparison. The aim is to not only understand the history of Chinese production but also work toward a better understanding of making, innovation, creation and provisioning in human history.    Permission of the professor is required. Chinese language reading required unless instructor\u2019s permission is obtained first.    Dark Ages in the Eastern Mediterranean: The Aegean, Anatolia and the Levant 1200-800 BCE Lorenzo d'Alfonso Thursdays 9:00 a.m. -12:00 p.m. lda5@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013.001    The turn of the second Millennium BCE caused a dramatic caesura in the History of the Eastern Mediterranean. Before that passage Western Asia was divided into large territorial states characterized by the so called \u201cpalatial economy\u201d. After that passage, we face a great variety of new political entities in the Levant, which current research is bringing more and more to light. In the East the regional powers of Assyria and Babylon evolve into Empires. Although these are embedded in a much older tradition of representation of kingship and state organisation, the dimensions of their territories and of the military and administrative apparatus and propaganda also identify a clear distance from the previous era.    The course will reconsider the different hypotheses about the short process of profound change which took place at the end of the 13 th century and during the first half of the 12 th century BCE, and the following evolution until the end of the Dark Ages. The focus will be set on specific case studies in the Aegean, Anatolia and the Levant during that time, with a critical approach to the way these processes have been reconstructed.    Permission of the professor is required.    Writing, Law, Divination and Religion in the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00 - 5:00 p.m. bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014.001    Generally scholarship puts the cult of the gods at the center stage of religious systems in antiquity. This seminar takes a different approach investigating the origins of writing, law, and divination, to demonstrate their intricate relationship with each other, and only then with cultic practice as well as the theological meta-structures of religion.    We will explore the early clay tokens and their potential relationship with early signs written on the first archaic tablets, as well as their combination with counting systems in order to understand the emergence of writing. Such inventions are linked with the more general and universal cognitive capacities for object recognition, naming, and categorizing. Consequently, a further aspect of research will be concerned with the archaic and Early Dynastic lists and their organization.    In Mesopotamia, the earliest samples of writing (ca. 3100 BCE) represent contracts reflecting oral transactions, which evince the existence of a legal system regulating social and economic interaction. The conceptualization of legal norms, however, is attested only in the early royal edicts (ca. 2600 BCE) evincing the royal appropriation of the legal system into their ideological self-representation which again was framed by the larger religious system.\u00a0 By that time the three main areas of constitutional law, administrative law, and economic activities were covered by the royal decrees using an elaborate legal terminology, which is then appropriated by the specialists for divination. A major aspect of our inquiry will be investigating the notion of kittu , which is generally translated as \u2018truth,\u2019 and \u2018 d\u012bnu \u2018case, trial\u2019 and how they link law to divination and beyond, to the larger world view.    The compelling feature about Mesopotamian divination is not only its direct link with legislation as expressed in the use of judicial language but also with the cuneiform writing system. The cognitive process of transforming pathological forms observed on the liver into signs with cultural meaning which then are interpreted within a complex semiotic system show a similar cognitive process as the creation of writing. Both cultural systems, writing and divination, are dominated by the impact of the notion of drawing and writing to outline recognizable patterns, which can be traced back to representational prototypes. The question of representational prototypes then will lead us to understand cultural key metaphors of Mesopotamian religion.    Specialists for early writing (Gonzalo Rubio), law (Norman Yoffee), and cognitive sciences (Rita Watson) will lead some of the sessions and provide their expertise and insight to these questions.    Requirements: The research seminar is open to graduate students, visiting scholars, and faculty. Permission of the professor is required. Any primary sources will be provided with translations. Students are required to do short response papers to the readings and a presentation in combination with a written final paper. \u00a0    Cultural Interactions in Eurasian Art &amp; Archaeology Soeren Stark/Lillian Tseng Wednesdays 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. lillian.tseng@nyu.edu , soeren.stark@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3015.001    Cross-cultural inquiries over the Eurasian continent are still, to a considerable degree, hampered both by the fragmenting character of traditional academic divisions (such as Near Eastern, Central Asian, East Asian, South Asian studies) and considerable language barriers. Whereas the current academic divisions encourage the in-depth investigation of issues derived from the \u2018core areas\u2019, it does not facilitate the cross-border inquiry that addresses the interconnectedness between assumed \u2018core areas\u2019.    This seminar is intended to bridge academic gaps by exploring a wealth of cultural interactions between Central Asia and East Asia through a series of representative cases dated from the fifth century BCE to the ninth century CE. In the class we will revisit the so-called \u201cScythian animal style\u201d that embodied the art of the steppe stretching from Ukraine to Northern China. We will compare how the Han Chinese perceived the Northern \u2018barbarians\u2019 and how the Xiongnu elites expressed their cultural identity themselves by commissioning and consuming prestigious art objects. We will have a closer look at how Soghdian funerary practices and the related visual arts persisted or were subsequently altered in their trading colonies in Northern China. The class will tackle material culture of Tang China, its shaping and its impact on the T\u00fcrk Qaghanats in the northwest and on Japan in the east. Finally, we will also consider the religious factor in cultural interaction by examining Buddhist grottos in B\u0101miy\u0101n and Dunhuang.    Permission of the professor is required. Reading knowledge of German or French is recommended, but alternate English readings are available if necessary. \u00a0    Fall 2011 Seminars \u00a0    Archaeology and Historiography: Perspectives on Time, Space, Text and Material Roderick B. Campbell Mondays: 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. roderickbcampbell@gmail.com    Though treated as separate disciplines and usually housed in different departments, at the highest level history and archaeology share the common goal of understanding the human past. Nevertheless, in both theory and method, not only are archaeology and history internally diverse, but also frequently miles apart.    This seminar will embark on an interdisciplinary exploration of the historical sciences: their histories, philosophies and methodologies. Special focus will be on theories of time (change, tradition, process, event, etc.), space (physical space, place, landscape, etc.), text (context, genre, discourse, memory, etc.) and material (material culture, materiality, things, actor-networks, etc.)    The reading load in this course will be heavy. Permission of the instructor is required.    Scientific practices and practitioners in Greco-Roman society Alexander Jones Wednesdays: 1:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. alexander.jones@nyu.edu    This seminar will explore the contexts and conditions in which scientific research, practice, writing, and teaching were conducted in the Greco-Roman world from c. 500 BCE to c. 600 CE. While a broad and comprehensive conception of science cannot be applied to Classical antiquity, intellectual traditions involving a systematic approach to the description, explanation, and prediction of phenomena and the prescription of actions were interrelated in various ways, for example by sharing methods and theoretical frameworks, by having some of the same people as practitioners, or by serving analogous social functions. The principal focuses of the seminar will be the richly documented conditions of activity of physicians and medical theorists from the Hippocratic to the Imperial periods, and the more fragmentary and challenging evidence pertaining to mathematicians, astronomers, and astrologers. Students must have proficiency in ancient Greek, and reading knowledge of at least one of French, German, and Latin. Permission of the instructor required.    The Archaeology of the Egyptian Oases Roger Bagnall Thursdays: 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. roger.bagnall@nyu.edu    This seminar will center on the ISAW-sponsored excavations in the Dakhla Oasis in the western desert of Upper Egypt, including the ongoing excavations of Amheida and the excavations carried out in 2006-2008 at the smaller site of Ain el-Gedida. Most of the material excavated at these sites to date has belonged to the third and fourth centuries CE, but at Amheida occupation goes back to the Old Kingdom or earlier, and there are substantial remains of the pharaonic periods of the first millennium BCE. There will be a specific focus on the relationship of archaeological contexts and the objects found in them, particularly but not only objects bearing writing. Special attention will be paid to the problems of insecure contexts and the interpretation of finds coming from such contexts.    There will be reading in French, German, and Italian. Students must have proficiency in at least one language, preferably two. Permission of the instructor required.     Divinatory Texts in Ancient Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays: 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. bpl2@nyu.edu    This course is intended to provide an insight into omen literature of Mesopotamia. It includes a mix of scientific and literary texts that in their formal structure derive from omen literature. We will read through an array of primary sources including Old Babylonian liver models, Old Babylonian extispicy omina and Neo-Assyrian omina containing historical allusionas, a Neo-Assyrian tam\u012btu -text as well as excerpts from the celestial omen series Enuma Anu Enlil . The reading of literary predictive texts from the Neo-Assyrian and Hellenistic periods - Prophecy A and the Uruk Prophecy - will illuminate the dependency of historiographic prophecies on astrological omina.    Students must have had at least one year of Akkadian. Permission of the instructor required.    Spring 2011 Seminars \u00a0    Chronology, Calendars, and Astronomy Alexander Jones Fridays: 9:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. alexander.jones@nyu.edu    A selection of recent and current research on astronomy and practices of short-term and long-term time reckoning in ancient Old World civilizations, with particular focus on ancient Near Eastern, Greco-Roman, and related traditions.    Permission of the professor is required.       Shaping the Divine in the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.    In this seminar we will explore the nature of the divine in the ancient Near East. Concepts of the divine are based on the concept of the person, which, in Antiquity, differs from the modern notion of individual personhood. The individual was conceived as embedded in the community of the family and the tribe or city at large. Rather than as an individual, the person was seen as a type assuming a variety of roles and functions. Ancient notions of the body and the person play very much into the conceptualization of the divine. What is more, ancient Near Eastern religions conceive of the divine as a relative category, which beyond anthropomorphic deities can be extended to living rulers, dead rulers, ancestors, demons, cultic objects, statutes, and celestial bodies. This fluid notion of the divine allows for a continuous re-conceptualization and reconfiguration of the polytheistic systems and monotheism. What is more it provides an insight into the various ways of social bonding of human kind with the divine. Methodological approaches to ethology, anthropology and cognitive sciences will help us to understand the ancient notion of divinity.    Permission of the professor is required.          Archaeology of Consumption in the Ancient Near East Caroline Sauvage Wednesdays 10:00 a.m - 1:00 p.m    Belongings define our world, and somehow define the individuals possessing them. From the early Neolithic to the modern day, humans have produced objects. Production first sustained basic needs but then also catered to aesthetics by creating pleasing objects such as jewelry or wall paintings. Consumer goods were charged with cultural meaning: they contributed to individual self-definition and collective identity. They were used to express gender, project cultural ideals, respond to social changes, and express status and rank in local and international environments. Therefore, symbol and intrinsic value of goods, ideas and images shaped consumption: for instance, the notion of prestige was closely associated to rare, restricted or exotic goods. Desire for foreign material increased exchange of raw materials and finished products. Imitations of exotic objects contributed to a wider diffusion and trickle-down of restricted products. Different societies did not interpret objects and images the same way: sometimes imported products were used \u201cincorrectly\u201d, their materiality being more important than their effective function. This reveals an intricate interaction between product and audience.    This course will explore the relationships between cultures, identities and consumption of goods, ideas and images in Ancient Near Eastern contexts. Class discussions will build upon (1) theoretical readings, and (2) student presentations concerning specific examples of consumption in the Ancient Near East. In-class discussions will evaluate the relevance of theories as compared to actual data, the reasons for their discrepancies or accordance.    Permission of the professor is required.          Territorial Fortifications in the Old World Soeren Stark Thursdays 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.    The seminar aims at a broad cross-cultural survey of the phenomenon of territorial fortifications in the Old world from Britain up to Northern China, from the late 3rd Millennium BC up to the pre-Mongol Middle Ages in the beginning of the 13th century AD. However, the focus will be laid on the various territorial fortifications in Eastern Iran and Western Central Asia and on questions regarding possible functions of these fortifications. In particular, the course will deal with the concept of pre-modern \"frontiers\" and its various social, economic and political aspects.    Course assignments are a presentation of one specific topic (30%) together with a research paper of 20-25 pages (50%) and participation in discussions (20%). A reading knowledge of English is required. The session in week 5 will also deal substantially with literature in German, the session in week 9 and 10 with literature in Russian.    Permission of the professor is required.    Fall 2010 Seminars    Ancient Texts and Documents: Editing a didactic manuscript from Roman Egypt Roger Bagnall and Alexander Jones Tuesdays 2:00-5:00pm    The focus of this seminar will be an unpublished Greek papyrus codex (comprising 13 leaves) from the fourth century of our era containing geometrical and arithmetical problems and model contracts. The manuscript will be studied through high resolution digital images. Our principal object, occupying part of each seminar meeting, will be to constitute a critical text and commentary; thus participants will have in depth exposure to important aspects of paleography, papyrology, codicology, and current research in pedagogy, science, and adminstration in late antiquity. The study of the codex as artifact and text will also serve as a foundation for research presentations that may extend into a broader social and intellectual context.    The editorial portion of each seminar meeting will take up one leaf of the codex, following their presumed order, with time reserved for revising the preceding session's work. Each editorial session will include establishment of the text, translation, and construction of a provisional commentary. Assignment of research presentations and papers will be settled at the beginning of the course according to the interests and competences of the individual participants. Presenters will provide readings and specialized bibliography in advance of their sessions.    Knowledge of ancient Greek is required for this seminar. Permission of the professor(s) required.    Central Asia and the Mediterranean from the 6th c.BC to the 8th c. AD Soeren Stark Thursdays 2:00-5:00pm    The course will inquire into the relations between the Mediterranean and the various steppe and oasis cultures in Central Asia from the Achaemenid period up to the early Middle Ages. These relations are characterized by a broad spectrum of different forms of contact and exchange. Direct contacts were established, for example, by military campaigns, diplomatic exchanges, migrations or colonization. Less direct ways of cultureal intermediation resulted from complex transcontinental trade flows. The course will focus on the consquencess which different forms of communication with the Mediterranean had on Central Asian art and material culture. In doing so topics like urbanism, sacral architecture and religious iconographies, but also aspects of material culture (ceramics, arms, costume) will have to be discussed.    A reading knowledge of two of the languages (French, German, Russian) is required. Permission of the professor is required.    History, Memory, and Media in China Lillian Tseng Wednesdays 3:00-6:00 pm    The seminar explores how art objects shape memory and intervene in history in China. It first focuses on bronze vessels and stone steles, investigating how media, intention, and reception influence the operation of commemorative art. It then tackles calligraphy and painting, discussing how the fusion of personal memory and collective memory transforms the tangle of the past and the present.    Prominent cases to be studied include the Simuwu bronze vessel cast in the Shang (c. 1600\u2013c.1050 BCE), the bronze basin inscribed by Qiang in the Western Zhou (c. 1050\u2013771 BCE), the stone steles erected by the First Emperor of the Qin (r. 221\u2013210 BCE), and the Preface to Collected Poems from the Orchid Pavilion written by Wang Xizhi (303\u2013361 CE). Discussions extend to the reception of antiquity in the Song (960\u20131279) and the Qing (1644\u20131911) periods. Comparable western theories and examples will also be examined.    Knowledge of Chinese is not required. Permission of the professor is required.    Spring 2010 Seminars \u00a0    Archaeology and Texts: Complementary, Redundant, and Contradictory Roger Bagnall and Holly Pittman Thursdays 10:00am-12:00pm    This seminar will address the issues involved in using multiple kinds of evidence for the investigation of problems in the study of the ancient world. It is organized around case studies that each participant will contribute to the discussion. The first half of the seminar will discuss such topics as the value of myth in third millennium Mesopotamia in interpreting the contemporary archaeological record and the reconstruction of imperial structure through the analysis of textual and visual lists. Participants will be expected to present topics of problems of archaeology and text within their own fields of interest.    The Exact Sciences in Antiquity Alexander Jones Wednesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    Topic: Mathematics and Astronomy in Mesopotamia We will examine the reading, interpretation, and contextualization of mathematical cuneiform texts, especially of the Late Babylonian and Seleucid periods, and astronomical texts of the first millennium B.C., with particular emphasis on recently published texts and research.    Globalization of Knowledge in the Multilingual and Multi-ethnic Milieu of the Ancient Near East II Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    See description for first half of course, above.       Fall 2009 Seminars \u00a0    Globalization of Knowledge in the Multilingual and Multi-ethnic Milieu of the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    Cuneiform culture, originally invented in Sumer, dominated the entire region of the ancient Near East despite local, political, and cultural differences and despite the fact that in many cultures Sumerian or Akkadian did not represent the spoken language. Throughout three thousand years of history, the body of educational and scholarly texts remained more or less uniform. The professionalism reflected in the textual corpora speaks in favor of a virtual community of intellectuals. Scribes and scholars viewed themselves as an established community of users of a shared traditional knowledge which was acquired by means of a common curriculum. Owing to their control of information and knowledge these scholars played an essential role among the elites of society. The same is true for craftsmen who, in antiquity, showed great mobility, and who, because of their skills, were among the first to be deported during times of war.\u00a0 The seminar will explore the nature of knowledge as transmitted in the cuneiform tradition, the relationship between science and religion, the carriers of knowledge, i.e. the communities of scholars and scribes; libraries and the findspots of the scholarly material and what these tell us about scribal practices, training, and competences in regions that were distant from Mesopotamia. These investigations will serve to detect the human agency behind the texts and material culture and the relationship between texts, objects and persons. The goal is to obtain a better grasp of the cultural mechanisms and strategies of the spread of knowledge in antiquity.    The Exact Sciences in Antiquity Alexander Jones Wednesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    Topic: Greco-Roman astrology The seminar will be devoted to several aspects of the history of Greco-Roman astrology, including: (1) the evidence for its date and place of origin, (2) the practice of astrology from the Hellenistic period to late antiquity as reflected in papyri, artifacts, and medievally transmitted texts, and (3) Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos (or Apotelesmatika) and the ancient tradition of commentaries on that work.

BCE-4th cent. CE). S \u00f6ren Stark soeren.stark@nyu.edu Thursdays, 10:00am \u2013 1:00pm    The boom of Xiongnu archaeology in present-day Mongolia and Buriatia (Russia) during the past two decades has decisively shaped and improved our understanding of Late Iron age nomadic cultures in Eastern Central Asia. Ever since, new data (not least resulting from a more comprehensive application of scientific analyses) and new methodological approaches have considerably stimulated the discussion of aspects such as elite representation between Han China and the \u2018Hellenistic west\u2019, transfer of technologies (in and outside the steppes), or non-elite life-ways among pastoral societies in the area. At the same time, however, we dispose of a considerable mass of older data on nomadic \u2018cultures\u2019 from the territories of the former Soviet-Union, contemporary with the Xiongnu in Mongolia and Buriatia: the so-called \u2018Hunno-Sarmatian horizon\u2019. In many ways, this older data now awaits reconsideration in light of the recent advances in Mongolia and Buriatia. In addition, we see the rapid accumulation of new data from present-day Xinjiang, Gansu and Inner Mongolia (China), pertaining to the same cultural horizon.\u00a0 The aim of our seminar is to re-evaluate older data and to integrate it together with new data into a systematic, regionally structured overview of Late Iron Age pastoral cultures from the trans-Caspian steppes to Inner Mongolia (China), and from Southern Siberia to present-day northern Afghanistan. This will allow us to better understand regional specifics and supra-regional dynamics within and beyond the nomadic world of the \u2018Hunno-Sarmatian horizon\u2019 in an integrated way. And, it is hoped, it will help us to line out potential avenues for future research on pastoral \u2018cultures\u2019 in Central Eurasia during antiquity. Advanced reading knowledge of Russian or Chinese and permission of the instructor is required. \u00a0    ISAW-GA 3010 Art, Archaeology, and Museology Lillian Tseng, Jason Sun lillian.tseng@nyu.edu Thursdays, 2:00-5:00 pm    This seminar explores how museology facilitates the study of art and archaeology through an upcoming special exhibition on the Qin and Han Empires (221 BCE- 220 CE) in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. We will study the objects to be displayed and investigate the characteristics of early imperial Chinese art and archaeology. We will also learn how a museum functions as a cultural institution through the curatorial efforts in acquisitions, exhibitions, and publications, especially how research and diplomacy play significant roles in developing international exhibitions.    Prof. Lillian Tseng at ISAW and Dr. Jason Sun at the Metropolitan Museum of Art will teach the seminar together. The class will take place not only in a seminar room at ISAW but also in the storage rooms of the Museum.    Permission of the instructors required.    ISAW-GA 3013 Astrological Texts in Papyri and Medieval Manuscripts Alexander Jones alexander.jones@nyu.edu Wednesdays 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar will constitute an introduction to the fundamentals of Greco-Roman astrology and its transmission, through the study of selected texts and documents preserved in Greco-Egyptian papyri and medieval manuscripts.    Knowledge of ancient Greek and permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3014 Ritual Text and Ritual Performance in the ANE Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Among other media, culture is constituted and articulated also in cultural performances including ceremonies, festivals, theater, and games. Inspired by theater studies, in the eighties and nineties interdisciplinary research of ethnology, anthropology, religious studies, and historical studies concerned with cultural performance of any kind promoted the\u00a0 performative turn \u00a0by emphasizing the body and bodily action over the thought and mind. This move towards\u00a0 action , i.e. the\u00a0 doing \u00a0of things, entailed a move away from the text. More recently, anthropology and sociology sidestepped these mind/body, thought/action dichotomies by introducing the concept of social drama and emphasizing social interaction. Within the last decade ritual studies have turned towards a more precise definition of ritual versus theater and performance and have reintroduced the complex relationship between text and performance (see the research project\u00a0 Ritualdynamik: Soziokulturelle Prozesse in historischer und kulturvergleichender Perspektive \u00a0at the University of Heidelberg). The seminar\u00a0 Ritual Text and Ritual Performance\u00a0 pursues a similar direction by exploring the various forms of ritual texts transmitted in ancient Near Eastern literature; the relationship between ritual text and ritual performance, i.e. of whether and how far we are allowed to consider cuneiform ritual texts as scripts for the execution of ritual action; the role of narrative for ritual performance; the combination of incantation, prayer, and action within the ritual complex; the\u00a0 memoria -aspect of ritual constituting identity, order, and continuity.    We will combine the reading of primary sources with the theoretical approaches.    Requirements: Knowledge of Akkadian and permission of the instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3018 Archaeology of Anatolia from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic Period Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso lda5@nyu.edu Mondays, 2:00pm-5:00pm    Within Ancient Western Asia the archaeology of Anatolia has a specific position. Separated from Mesopotamia and the Levant by the imposing Tauros Mountains, Anatolia maintained communication, kept up with the developments taking place in the Fertile Crescent, and developed its own peculiar organization of complex group societies. Starting with the Neolithic, the course will explore the archaeological data reflecting the first evidence of social hierarchies and regional power, the development of metallurgy in the EBA, the creation of an empire in the mountains with a territorial organization, and the many and diverse developments and ultimate fall of this empire. We will then go on to look at the remains of then-new kingdoms of Phrygia and Lydia, already in direct contact with archaic Greece, as well as the impact of the Achaemenid conquest, up to the Hellenistic period. The course will offer an overview of the most important historical and archaeological themes connected with the ancient history of Anatolia; for each period, one key Anatolian site will presented with the scope to make students familiar with the relation between theory, historical reconstruction, and the rough archaeological data on which they are based.    Permission of the instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3020 The Discovery of Iranian Antiquity Daniel T. Potts daniel.potts@nyu.edu \u00a0 Tuesdays, 9am \u2013 12:00pm    The invention of printing in the late 15 th \u00a0century, coupled with increased traffic between European capitals and the Safavid court in the 16 th \u00a0and 17 th \u00a0centuries, resulted in a growth of interest in Iran\u2019s pre-Islamic past. Europeans visited major sites like Persepolis, Pasargadae and Naqsh-e Rustam; compared their situations with accounts in Classical sources; copied inscriptions; and brought portable antiquities back to their homelands. Enlightenment scholars (philologists, antiquarians, numismatists) of the 18 th \u00a0century worked assiduously on this material and established a substantial baseline of knowledge that served as a springboard for the better-known investigations, both archaeological and historical, of the 19 th \u00a0century. This course will look at what early modern Europeans contributed to the growth of Iranology.    Prerequisites: very good reading knowledge of French and German (ability to read Gothic script is an advantage). Permission of the instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3023 Mapping and Data Visualization for the Ancient World Sebastian Heath sh1933@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 10:00am -1:00pm    This course considers tools and methods for the effective communication of scholarly research through data-driven maps and the visualization of small and large datasets. By frequent hands-on use and demonstration of their work, students will gain confidence in using web-based tools as well as software that runs directly on their own computers. A constant focus will be the ability of such tools and software to import and export data in standard formats and to enable sharing of the maps and visualizations that students create. Accordingly, students will gain expertise in data interchange formats such as the Javascript Object Notation (JSON). Topics stressed over the course of the term will include the temporal component of spatial data as well as connectivity within data sets. We will also survey current approaches to the application of digital methods to historical and archaeological research and teaching. A particular outcome for students will be the ability to assess the relevance of both current and future tools for their own work. The majority of our examples will come from the ancient world as ISAW defines it, though students with other interests can enroll. It is expected that students will bring their own computers to class. While there are no prerequisites, participants should be willing to commit considerable time to rapidly gaining the technical skills that will be presented in class.    Permission of instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3003-001 Directed Study: Hittite Texts Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso lda5@nyu.edu Thursdays, 5:00-7:00pm (6 th \u00a0Floor Large Conference Room)    Hittite, the earliest Indo-European language, is attested on cuneiform tablets, and was created as a means of recording numerous and various types of information collected by the royal court of Hattusa, and by some other administrative centers on the periphery of the Great Kingdom of Hatti. In some cases different types of information were recorded in different textual genres, and because of cuneiform schooling it is not rare that different genres used a wider or more restricted number of cuneiform signs, values, as well as a different vocabulary, formulary or phrasary. The course aims at introducing the participants to the different types of texts written in Hittite. Each lesson will be devoted to transcription and translation of ca. 30 lines of one \u2018genre\u2019. Thus, a sample from the Hittite Laws, letters, treaties, edicts, annals, prayers, rituals, feasts, oracular inquiries, inventories, poems and mythic narratives will be transcribed and translated along the semester, and for each text genre a piece of secondary literature about form and/or content of the genre will be discussed by the class.    Prerequisites: an introductory course of Hittite Language (Hittite I) and permission of the instructor.    Fall Seminars 2014    The Exact Sciences in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages Alexander Jones Mondays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm alexander.jones@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3002    In this seminar we will examine episodes in the circulation of scientific knowledge and practices in the Mediterranean world (broadly conceived) from the third century CE to the end of the first millennium. The approach will be primarily through study of original texts, some of which will be chosen according to the specific interests and expertise of participants.    Knowledge of one or more of the relevant ancient languages (Greek in particular, Latin, Arabic, ...) is required. Permission of the instructor required.    Late Antique Documents Roger Bagnall Mondays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm roger.bagnall@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3007    The seminar will examine a series of papyrus archives from late antique Egypt and Palestine, mostly in Greek but with some documents partly or entirely in Latin, Coptic, and Arabic. The archives will range from villages to cities, private to public, and secular to monastic. Readings will be mostly of primary documents but also some modern discussions of the archives. The central focuses will be on the formation of what we call archives, their potential for historical study, and their limitations.    A reading knowledge of Greek and either French or German is required. Permission of the instructor required.    Art, Archaeology and Material Culture Lillian Tseng Wednesdays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm lillian.tseng@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010    This seminar explores various approaches that help us understand and elaborate the unearthed objects of extraordinary craftsmanship, a large corpus of fascinating material that has not yet been fully studied by archaeologists or art historians. The seminar seeks to strike a balance between methodological reflections and case studies. Theories and examples to be investigated are not limited to any specific cultural area.  Permission of the instructor required.    Early Chinese Literary Manuscripts Adam Schwartz Fridays, 1:00 \u2013 4:00pm acs21@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3012    This text-reading course will introduce the major corpora of newly discovered Early Chinese literary manuscripts and the philological methods fundamental to work with them.\u00a0 Readings will be from the Zhou through the Han, with focus on Warring States genre and popular readership, provincial scripts and stationery.    Permission of the instructor required.    Greek and Roman Portraiture Hallie Franks Mondays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm hmf2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013    This course will engage with critical issues that surround the study of ancient portraiture traditions in the Greek and Roman worlds. Some of the questions we will address over the course of the semester include: How do modern assumptions about the function and genre of portraiture, and its relationship to the subject, impact approaches to ancient material?\u00a0How do we develop a vocabulary for the different potential relationships between subject and visual product?\u00a0How do we think about intent, and what kinds of material provide context for interpretation?\u00a0How do portraits serve in public or private roles in different ways?\u00a0How can we use traditions of portraiture to think about ancient concepts of and expressions of various identities? This course deals primarily with classical material, but it also involves critical engagement with and analysis of the visual and the processes of contextualization.    Permission of the instructor required.    Advanced Reading of Akkadian: The Political and Cultural Relations between Assur and Babylon Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014-001    In addition to consolidating the knowledge of Akkadian grammar the Advanced Reading of Akkadian Class is designed to introduce into various dialects of Akkadian from a diversity of regions and periods and to familiarize the student with a diversity of paleographies as well as text categories.

Potts Tuesdays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm dtp2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3018    This seminar will examine the native peoples and regions of the Zagros mountain regions (Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Luristan) from their first appearance in cuneiform sources of the third millennium BC to the end of the Assyrian/Neo-Elamite period. Principle groups and regions that will be considered include Gutium, Simurrum, Lullubum, the Turukkaeans, Mannaea and Ellipi. The role of Ur III, Kassite, Assyrian and Urartian territorial ambitions in the region will be investigated as well as the nature of the landscape and the groups that inhabited it through time.    No formal requirements, but good reading knowledge of German and French would be helpful. Permission of the instructor required.    The Transition from Late Antiquity to Early Islam Robert Hoyland Tuesdays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm rgh2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3020-001    This course focuses on the question of what changed and what did not change in Near Eastern society in the course of the fifth to ninth centuries AD. \u00a0Consideration will be given to both the micro level (individual objects, themes, groups etc) and the macro level (was Pirenne right about the disruptive nature of the Arab conquests, is Becker's characterization of Islam as the culmination of late antique culture apt, etc). and to literary and archaeological themes and sources.    Permission of the instructor required.    The Body in the Ancient World Claire Bubb Wednesdays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm claire.coiro@gmail.com ISAW-GA 3020-002    This seminar will consider ancient understanding of and attitudes towards the human body. Our primary goal will be to trace the shifting conceptions of human physiology from Egyptian medical papyri to the Arabic tradition, with a heavy focus on the Greeks and Romans. How did cultures with strong taboos around the body form theories about the organs hidden within it? How did the ancients grapple with the brain, the nervous system, and the interrelationship of the soul and the body? How did the concept of the humors develop and what were the rival theories? How close did the Greeks come to understanding blood and the circulatory system and why did they miss its circular nature? Why did Galen\u2019s physiology come to dominate Western thought for centuries after his death, and how did the Arabic authors responsible for much of its transmission receive and respond to his theories? In order to understand the cultural context behind the development and evolution of these theories, we will also briefly consider religious, literary, and artistic treatment of the body, including burial customs, the centrality of the body to early Christianity, and the fascination with the body revealed across literary genres, particularly rhetoric and the novels.    Permission of the instructor required.    Spring 2014 Seminars \u00a0    Perspectives on the Ancient World in Medieval Islamic Histories Robert Hoyland Thursdays 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm rgh2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3020    In this course we will read from the works of a number of Muslim historians in order to ascertain their attitude, and that of Islamic civilization at large, towards the ancient world. \u00a0The aim will be to explore how the Islamic world situated itself with respect to past civilizations, why it favoured some past peoples over others, and how the forces of Time, Fate and God's will played a part in the evanescence of the past.    Arabic and permission of the instructor required.    Wall Paintings in Central Asia S\u00f6ren Stark &amp; Fiona Kidd Mondays 5:00 \u2013 8:00pm soeren.stark@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3009    Wall paintings constitute, since the 1 st millennium BCE, at least one of the major means employed to decorate architectural spaces of various sorts \u2013 religious (temples, monasteries), communal-palatial, private dwellings, tombs, etc. \u2013 throughout Central Asia. As such, murals constitute, in particular for the pre-Islamic period, one of the main categories of visual arts at our disposal. Yet wall paintings are not only significant for the study of art history in pre-Islamic Central Asia: in fact \u2013 and considering the near complete loss of other visual materials such as textile wall hangings and illuminated books, and the general scarcity of written sources \u2013 murals constitute a critical source for our understanding of the religious, social, economic and sometimes even political history of the area before the advent of Islam.    This class aims at a comprehensive overview of the most important sites and architectural ensembles with substantial wall painting remains in the area. Chronologically they range from the final centuries BCE to the 9 th /10 th century CE. Geographically we will focus on the regions of Choresmia, Sogdiana, Bactria-Tokh\u0101rist\u0101n and the Tarim basin. This will allow us to review difficult and still much-debated questions concerning the production of wall paintings in Central Asia. Those include questions regarding the significance of regional styles as evidence for regional schools and itinerant workshops, the social and economic background of artists and patrons, ways of transfer of artistic models, and regional variances regarding cultural preferences in elite representation.    Permission of the instructor required.    Literature and the Question of Genre in the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014    In the last decades the category of \u2018literature\u2019 in the Ancient Near East has come repeatedly under scrutiny. It included among other topics fierce discussions about how to define the literary corpus, orality and aurality, the notion of genre, the validity of historical references in literary works and the fluid boundaries between \u2018literature\u2019 and \u2018historiography,\u2019 where to locate literary production - school, temple, or palace, and how far the production process determined functional and pragmatic aspects of literary works.    To isolate literature from its historical context as l\u2019art pour l\u2019art aesthetics favoring formalistic features over pragmatic and historical concerns certainly does not do justice to ancient literary works. While formalistic features such as the use of literary dialects might operate as a way of categorization, recently, due to the nature of the texts, narratology as well as fictionality have been considered equally important. Literature rather should be defined as a particular medium alongside other media as part of the social and cultural discourse. Moreover, what makes an oeuvre historically significant, is not necessarily established by the qualities of the work or by the author but by its history of reception and its intertextuality and intermediality. The seminar investigates what constituted literary works, how literary works became part of the stream of tradition, were affected by and affected historical conditions, and entered intertextual and intermedial relations.    Knowledge of Akkadian and permission of the instructor required.    Dilmun, Magan, and Meluhha Daniel T. Potts **This is a condensed seminar. The class will meet twice a week from January 27 \u2013 March 18; Mondays 1-4pm and Tuesdays 9am-12pm** dtp2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3018    Third millennium cuneiform sources refer to three lands associated with the 'Lower Sea' (Persian Gulf): Dilmun, in the northern and central Gulf, centered on Bahrain, the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and Failak (Kuwait); Magan, in the Oman peninsula; and Meluhha, conventionally identified with the Harappan civilization in the Indus Valley. In this seminar we will examine the archaeological and cuneiform sources from and about this region, paying particular attention to the period c. 6000 BC to the 1st century AD. The seminar will emphasize local developments in the region, including both funerary and settlement data, and evidence of inter-regional contact (ceramics, stone vessels, metals, semi-precious stones).    Permission of the instructor required.    Greco-Roman Astrology and Astronomy and the Antecedents Alexander Jones Mondays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm alexander.jones@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3002    This seminar will be an introduction to the goals, methods, and practices of Greek mathematical astronomy during the period from the second century BCE through the second century CE (essentially from Hipparchus to Ptolemy) and to the Greco-Roman astrology that depended on this astronomy. Sources will include texts transmitted via medieval manuscripts (e.g. Ptolemy's works in Greek and Arabic), papyri, and presumed adaptations of Greek astronomy and astrology in other traditions such as those of India. Particular attention will be paid to the Greek reception and modification of elements of astronomy and astrology from Mesopotamia and Egypt.    Knowledge of Greek or other languages significant for these traditions and permission of the instructor required.    Landscapes and Territoriality in Western and Eastern Asia BCE Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Roderick Campbell Wednesdays 9:30am \u2013 12:30pm lda5@nyu.edu , rbc2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3012    How is place and landscape conceived in times and places before nation states, maps and national borders? What, if any, notions of territoriality were in operation in ancient polities like the Shang kingdom at Anyang or the Neo-Hittite polities of Anatolia? How are they linked to such concepts as community, town/city, and land? And on the other hand, how do modern scholars reconstruct landscapes and territoriality of ancient polities?    The course will approach these and similar questions dividing between classes on theory where some basic methodological contributions are discussed, and classes devoted to case studies, where specific aspects are dealt with in well-defined historical context.    At lease one foreign language and permission of the instructor required. \u00a0    Early Chinese Epigraphy: Bones, Bronze, and Bamboo Roderick Campbell and Adam Schwartz Thursdays 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm rbc2@nyu.edu , acs21@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010    In this course students will acquire a foundation in epigraphic methodology and work through a selection of epigraphic texts from Shang through Warring States times. Fundamental epigraphic training will include an understanding of the basic principles of Chinese graph formation as well as the fundamentals of phonological, morphological and syntactic reconstruction. Consideration of writing media, context and register will also be addressed. Familiarity with corpus access (through compendium, on-line databases, etc.) and resources (dictionaries, concordances, etc.) will form part of the training on each corpus discussed. The main corpuses of excavated texts will be Shang oracle-bone inscriptions, Shang and Western Zhou bronze inscriptions, and Eastern Zhou bamboo slips. We will attempt to cover a wide range of genres with an eye to giving students as broad a paleographic base as possible.    Coursework will consist of weekly assignments \u2013 usually in the form of translations and preparation to read specific texts in common. The final course assignment will be the annotated translation of a text of reasonable size and complexity.    Ability to read classical Chinese and permission of instructors required. \u00a0    Maps, Models, and Databases: Digital Tools for the Ancient World Sebastian Heath Wednesdays 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm sebastian.heath@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013    Our goal in this course is to gain hands-on skills with the digital tools that are changing the nature of research and the publication of scholarship related to the Ancient World. The focus is material culture and throughout the term students will work with free tools that enable sharing of results. Students will not only learn how to make 3D models of objects in museum collections, but also how to choose open formats that let one publish those models on the Internet. Google Maps and Earth will play a prominent role, and students will also use the more capable web-based GIS CartoDB ( http://cartodb.com ). A goal will always be to explore how these tools can work together to make innovative presentations of scholarly research. Other topics include the role of open licenses in modern scholarship, database structures appropriate for capturing the heterogeneity of ancient material culture, network analysis, the geographic component of ancient primary sources, and the deployment of Linked Open Data. Throughout the term students will evaluate both cloud-based tools and downloadable software, while also reviewing websites and digital publications that provide access to important resources. Students will gain an ability to use current tools as well as the confidence to assess new tools as they become available in the future. This course will be of particular interest to students needing to incorporate digital manifestations of material culture into their dissertations or other scholarly work. \u00a0    Fall 2013 Seminars \u00a0    Public Health in the Ancient World Roger Bagnall and Roderick Campbell Mondays 2:00-5:00 p.m. roger.bagnall@nyu.edu ; rbc2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3022    Revolutionary developments in the biological sciences, accompanied as well by discoveries in the physical sciences, have opened up possibilities for study of the human past unimaginable a generation ago. To long-established methods dependent on description and quantification have been added technologies that allow us to find out, for example, whether people buried at Rome were also born and raised there, or what kind of carbohydrates dwellers of an Egyptian oasis were eating. The routes of transmission of plant species can be seen as never before; modern demographic techniques like model life tables have given new life to ancient demography, once a laughingstock; scientific excavation of arid sites coupled with new technologies has produced information on morbidity and mortality unobtainable until now. We have now the opportunity to begin to put together a comprehensive sense of the factors of health over the vast span of human history we call antiquity, while at the same time study changing, collective human responses to disease, nutrition, risk and ultimately, mortality.    This course will have a symposium format with different specialists each week presenting on a range of topics from paleopathology to ancient demography. In addition to weekly response papers students will write a final paper relating one or more of the symposium\u2019s topics to the overarching theme of public health in the ancient world.    Permission of the instructor required.    Iranian Archaeology in the 21 st Century Daniel T. Potts Tuesdays 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm daniel.potts@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3018    The publication of recent excavations (post-2000) in journals like Iran , Iranica Antiqua and Arch\u00e4ologische Mitteilungen aus Iran und Turan , as well as in monographs and conference volumes (published inside and outside of Iran) has resulted in a significant addition to our knowledge of Iranian archaeology in all periods of the pre-Islamic past. Accessing that new data and integrating it with what was already known is not always easy, however. This seminar will involve close reading of the past 13 years of scholarship in Iranian archaeology with an emphasis on primary publications of excavations and museum collections (rather than secondary literature). The aim will be to evaluate this new material and assess how it fits in with what was already known about the relevant site, region and/or period; consider where it challenges previous beliefs; and discuss what new questions it raises.    Permission of the instructor required.    Hittite History, Language &amp; Archaeology Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso Mondays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm lda5@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013    The Hittite empire had a profound impact on the history of Pre-classical Western Asia. After a period defined by the presence of local principalities, and a formative phase in the 17 th century, a complex political machine developed in Central Anatolia. The creation of a system of large structures for containment of water and seeds allowed local societies to overcome for the first time the regional challenges resulting from the weather and landscape. These important structures are part of a comprehensive approach to complex social life, whose effects became concretely observable in the so-called Early Empire. In this period, for example, normative texts were produced, some defining the administrative function of the capital and peripheral districts, some \u2013what we call rituals and feasts-, defining the cultic activity between the core to the periphery, and the syncretic pantheon. The tension between the \u201c possible empire \u201d emerging from these texts and the local developments produced by various actors can be understood through the lens of the historical context in which the empire operated for almost 500 years. The course aims at providing participants with basic information and updated research on the Hittites. Each class will be divided into two parts: one touching different themes of the history and archaeology of the Hittites; the other providing an introduction into the Hittite language and script.    Participation 30%; one presentation during course 40%; final written exam 30% (no final paper)    Requirements: one foreign language: either French, Italian or German    Permission of the instructor required.    Introduction to GIS &amp; Spatial Analysis in Anthropology &amp; Archaeology Emily Hammer Wednesdays 9:30am \u2013 12:30pm ehammer@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3012 \u2013 Class takes place at 24 Waverly Place, Rm. 668    This course aims to provide a basic understanding of how remote sensing data (satellite imagery and aerial\u00a0photographs) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to visualize, analyze, and integrate\u00a0archaeological, anthropological, historical, environmental, and hydrological data. \u00a0It also aims to introduce students to the process\u00a0of designing and carrying out a spatial research project. \u00a0Students will learn basic techniques for acquiring,\u00a0manipulating, and creating geospatial data in several forms, including pixel-based satellite imagery and digital\u00a0terrain models as well as point, line, and polygon representations of data. \u00a0Each week, these techniques will be\u00a0applied to sample archaeological data and also to data from a region/topic chosen by the student. \u00a0In addition to lab-based work, students will learn basic field techniques of field survey, including how to navigate and record using a\u00a0Global Positioning System (GPS) handheld receiver, how to integrate GPS data into a GIS database, and how to\u00a0produce maps for fieldwork and publication. \u00a0The course will use ESRI's ArcGIS software.    Permission of the instructor required.    Time in Greco-Roman Antiquity: Texts and Material Culture Alexander Jones Thursdays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm alexander.jones@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3002    In the ancient Greek and Roman world time was initially flexible, inexact, and tied to the natural environment. The risings and settings of the Sun, the phases of the Moon, and the cycle of the seasons supplied the basic framework of days, months, and years by which people organized daily life, commerce, religion, and government. However, astronomers, mathematicians, mechanicians, and scholars developed increasingly precise ways of measuring, organizing, and keeping track of time. This seminar will investigate the varied technologies and practices of time management known from textual sources and artifacts, and the interaction between the development of these technologies and practices and the awareness and representation of measured time in Greco-Roman society.    Permission of the instructor required.    Advanced Reading of Akkadian - Literary Texts in Ancient Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014    This course is intended to provide an insight into the corpus of literary texts of Mesopotamia. It includes a mix of poems, epics, and myths, the Agushaya Hymn, Tukulti-Ninurta Epic, the Erra Epic, Anzu Myth and Etana Myth, just to name a few. Most of these texts come in various versions from different periods thus allowing for investigating their transmission through time. They are written in the Hymnic-Epical Dialect or the Standard Babylonian dialect. Consequently, beyond acquiring knowledge of great Mesopotamian literary works, the students will train in reading these literary dialects. At least one year of Akkadian is required.    Permission of the instructor required.    Spring 2013 Seminars \u00a0    Transmission of Ancient Science into Arabic Robert Hoyland Thursdays 2:00 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3002 rgh2@nyu.edu    The aim of this course is to explore the different paths along which knowledge of Antiquity passed into Muslim intellectual culture and how it was received and interpreted. \u00a0The focus will not just be on the so-called translation movement, but also the broader question of how pre-Islamic histories and cultures fared in the Middle East after the Arab conquests. \u00a0A core part of the course will be reading original Arabic texts and assessment will be via a final paper that must involve study of extracts from Arabic texts.    Permission of the instructor required.    Greek Texts on Mechanics Alexander Jones Mondays 1:00 p.m. \u2013 4:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3007 alexander.jones@nyu.edu    A selection of Greek mechanical texts, including Pappus of Alexandria's \"Introduction to Mechanics\" (Book 8 of his Synagoge ) and Heronian works from the \"Mynas Codex\" ( Par. suppl. gr. 607) will be studied on the basis of medieval manuscripts, with particular attention to the manuscript diagrams.    Knowledge of ancient Greek is required. Permission of the instructor required.    \u201cSoghdians in their Homeland\u201d \u2013 the Archaeology of Soghdia from ca. 600 BCE to ca. 750 CE S\u00f6ren Stark Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 2:00 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m; March 26 \u2013 May 9 ISAW-GA 3009 soeren.stark@nyu.edu    Spectacular finds and a general interest in Old World connectivity has in recent years sparkled much interest in Soghdians abroad, in particular in their colonies along the so-called Silk Roads and in the Chinese plains. Much less attention has been paid, outside a small scholarly circle, to their homeland at the banks of the rivers Zerafshan and Kashka-Darya (in present-day Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) \u2013 with the result that the discussion of \u201cSoghdians along the Silk Roads and in China\u201d is often based on too imprecise (sometimes even wrong) assumptions about their \u2018original\u2019 cultural traditions.    Particularly regrettable is a certain tendency to use the term \u201cSoghdian\u201d almost in a generic way, subsuming everything \u201cIranian\u201d east of the Iranian plateau under one fashionable label. This seminar aims for some clarification on this issue by systematically and comprehensively assessing our current knowledge on the archaeology of Soghdia, from the dawn of constitutive cultural features in the region during the pre-Achaemenid Iron Age to the incorporation of Soghdia into the Dar al-Islam in the course of the 8th century. The approach will be micro-regional, that is we will follow the main trends of development regarding settlement patterns, site typology, architecture, ceramic, metal and textile production, as well as burial costumes and visual arts for each micro-region separately \u2013 as far as possible. This is an ambitious aim that has not been undertaken in a systematic way. As a result, it is hoped, we will be able to not only distinguish more precisely \u201cSoghdian\u201d cultural features from those associated with Khorezmia, Ferghana, Bactria or Sasanian Iran, but also to perceive intra-regional variations and trends.    This seminar is held intensively from March 26 th \u2013 May 9 th . Russian and permission of the instructor is required.    The Art of Antiquity in the Metropolitan Museum: A Global Perspective Lillian Tseng/Paul Zanker Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 3:00pm-6:00pm January 29 - March 14 ISAW-GA 3012 lillian.tseng@nyu.edu    This seminar explores the collections of Ancient art in the Metropolitan Museum with a global perspective. It seeks to clarify the distinct features of art objects produced in the Greco-Roman World and in Early China through contrast and comparison. Mediums to be studied range from sculpture, pictorial arts to decorative arts. Topics to be discussed include heroes, deities, mythology, auspiciousness, monumentality, and femininity.    The seminar encourages students to establish direct connections with objects. All classes meet in the galleries or storerooms of the Museum. The seminar is led by Lillian Tseng and Paul Zanker. Dr. Zanker is the author of Roman Art (J. Paul Getty Museum, 2010) and Pompeii: Public and Private Life (Harvard University Press, 1998).    This seminar is held intensively from January 29 th to March 14 th . The first class meets in the lecture hall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. No languages are required.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Beyond Apogee and Collapse: Empires and other Polities in the Ancient World (BCE) Roderick Campbell/Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso Fridays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3013 rbc2@nyu.edu , lda5@nyu.edu    \u201cThe fall of the Assyrian empire\u201d; \u201cthe collapse of the Mayan civilization\u201d \u2013 the idea of collapse fascinates the contemporary imagination, conjuring images of melancholy ruins and vanished civilizations. The apogee of empires is what is generally contrasted with the post-collapse situation, but what of everything in between? When researchers detach their gaze from successful military deeds, or abrupt changes in the archaeological record, a sort of skepticism on the consistence and the sense of ancient polities occurs, and lower scale social organization \u2013urban, kin, or primary production based, appears as the main \u2018real\u2019 elements defining the scenario.    The course will discuss how empires and other polities of the ancient world (4 th to 1 st millennium BCE) operate over the long-term. \u00a0On the basis of more recent studies, it will reconsider the concepts of \u201capogee\u201d and \u201ccollapse\u201d as embedded in a more dynamic understanding of historical processes. These and similar questions about the nature and functioning of ancient political forms over time will be the focus of the seminar, divided in a group of classes on theoretic approaches, followed by a series of case studies.    SYLLABUS    Permission of the instructor is required.    Arabia in Antiquity c. 3500 BCE \u2013 750 CE George Hatke Tuesdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3018 geh2@nyu.edu    While ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Syria-Palestine have been the subject of scholarly investigation for the better part of two centuries, the Arabian Peninsula remains an understudied region by historians and archaeologists alike. This results not only from the difficulties of traveling to, and conducting research in, Arabia, but also from a long-standing view that ancient Arabia was little more than a peripheral region of the Near East whose nomadic tribes periodically migrated into more northerly regions but which had little history of its own.    This seminar seeks to demonstrate that, far from being peripheral to the ancient Near East, the Arabian Peninsula was in fact an axis of the Near Eastern, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean worlds and must therefore be considered an integral part of antiquity. From this broader perspective, such developments in ancient Arabian history as the diffusion of Semitic languages, the rise of state societies, the growth of long-distance trade, and ultimately the spread of monotheistic tradition(s) will be studied against the backdrop of the political, social, economic, and cultural history of the ancient world at large. In this way students of antiquity will learn how to interpret and evaluate evidence for contact between cultures, using the Arabian Peninsula as a case study. Particular emphasis will be placed on three key regions of Arabia: 1) South Arabia and the Red Sea, 2) East Arabia and the Persian/Arabian Gulf, and 3) the desert frontier of the Fertile Crescent that constitutes North Arabia. The timeframe of the seminar extends from the Early Bronze Age (beginning in the mid-fourth millennium BCE) to the Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE).    Among the questions that will be dealt with in this seminar are: 1) What role did agriculture and trade play in ancient Arabian society, and what evidence survives of these two facets of the Arabian economy? 2) To what extent were ancient Arabian politics shaped by external political and economic factors? How and why did some foreign polities (e.g. the Ethiopian kingdom of Aksum and the S\u0101s\u0101nid Empire of Iran) establish spheres of influence while no Arabian polity expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula until the seventh century CE? 3) Who were the Arabs and what made them different from other Arabian peoples? Is it possible to speak of the Arabs as a single, coherent group in pre-Islamic times? 4) How did monotheistic traditions reshape Arabian society during Late Antiquity (c. 200-700 CE)? Why did Islam emerge when it did, and why in Arabia, as opposed to another desert region like the Sahara?    Permission of the instructor required.    Relations between Mesopotamia &amp; Iran Daniel T. Potts Wednesdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3019 kel306@nyu.edu    This seminar will consider a variety of issues in the archaeology of Mesopotamia and Iran from late prehistory through the end of the Bronze Age. Some of those issues will be examined in a synchronic fashion while others will be investigated diachronically. Accounting for changes in material culture and cultural practices, as well as continuities, is a constant theme in much archaeological research, sometimes centering around specific domains of material culture or cultural activity, sometimes taking a more global approach. This year\u2019s seminar will examine a range of different issues diachronically. The intention is to initiate a discussion around the role of technology and demography as variables which impact upon the continuities and changes that are attested in a number of different domains.    This course poses a series of key questions of a series of cultural domains and practices attested in Mesopotamia and Iran (6 th -2 rd millennia BC), with a view to charting structural continuities and discontinuities through time. The appropriateness of technological and social explanations of these phenomena will be discussed and evaluated.    Knowledge of French and/or German required. Permission of the instructor required.    The History of Assyria in Ancient and Modern Historiography Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3020 bpl2@nyu.edu    This seminar is not geared towards an event-oriented history of Assyria. Its also not concerned with the social science oriented history including quantitative sociological and economic history modeled after the natural sciences and its claim for objective truth. Rather than a history from below, the emphasis is on the study of the textual production as it related to or occurred at the Assyrian courts throughout their history and on how ancient historiography proceeded from facts or empirical events to create a coherent story about the deeds of the king that met the expectations linked with the office of rulership, which were informed by a longstanding tradition and the world view of the time. We will educate ourselves as to how to interpret the various text genres that Assyriologists have classified as chronicles and annals by critically re-evaluating our modern taxonomy applied to the ancient texts and explore how these \u2018genres\u2019 interface with what we tend to subsume under fiction and literature. In addition to such critical attitude toward the text, informed by postmodern literary theory and linguistics, linguistic features of the ancient texts and the shape of the tablet as well as the context of the text will illuminate our interpretation of the ancients\u2019 intentionality. We will explore to what degree the writings were indeed concerned with the past, what the inserting of \u2018historical factual data\u2019 was aiming at and further critically evaluate the assumption that history needs always to be written in a narrative.    The goal of the seminar is threefold: 1) to familiarize ourselves with the various text categories, 2) to acquire knowledge in the various dialects of the Assyrian language as well as in the \u2018hymnic epical dialect\u2019 by reading primary sources related to the general discussion and 3) to acquire an insight into the cultural and intellectual setting in which historiography was written by the ancient scholars for the political elites.    The reading of Akkadian texts related to the seminar will be complemented by a further tutorial on Thursday 11AM - 1PM.    As in former years the seminar will be concluded with a workshop. This year\u2019s participants:\u00a0 Jean-Jacques Glassner; Peter Machinist; Piotr Michalowski, and Nele Ziegler. Akkadian is required for those who attend the reading sessions.    Permission of the instructor required.    Pottery and Empire in the Roman Mediterranean Sebastian Heath Wednesdays 2:00 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3021 sebastian.heath@nyu.edu    This course surveys the types of pottery available in the Roman-period Mediterranean and encourages students to consider how that material contributes to the study of large-scale economic and political history, as well as its contribution to focused questions of individual consumer experience and the interpretation of specific archaeological contexts. Students will gain familiarity with the basic vocabulary and techniques of ceramic study while always asking why this material is important to understanding the Roman Empire. The majority of the readings concern the Eastern Mediterranean, but we will consider the Mediterranean as a unit.\u00a0 Some titles in the required readings are drawn from fields entirely outside the ancient Mediterranean. Students will be able to explore specific regions or issues within the study of Roman pottery in their research paper.    Permission of the instructor required.    Fall 2012 Seminars     Introduction to Papyrology    Roger Bagnall Tuesdays 2:00-5:00 p.m. roger.bagnall@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3007    This seminar will introduce students to both technical and substantive sides of papyrology. It will read a representative selection of published papyri from the Hellenistic, Roman, and Late Antique periods, with an emphasis on the interpretive challenges posed by documentary evidence; and students will learn to decipher Greek handwritings and prepare a critical edition of a papyrus.    A knowledge of Greek is required; Latin and Coptic would be useful, and there will be readings in French and German. Permission of the professor is required.    Conceptions of Ethnicity in the Ancient World Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Soeren Stark Wednesdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. lda5@nyu.edu , soeren.stark@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3009    The problem of ethnicity is a recurring and widely discussed topic in studies related to a wide range of pre-modern societies and cultures. Historical conceptions, rooted in national movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have taken for granted that terms like \u201cpeople\u201d, \u201ctribe\u201d, etc. refer to racially and culturally homogeneous groups, sharing a common descendance and destiny, speaking the same language and living within one state. In this way, \u201cpeoples\u201d (and not individuals or social groups) were seen as something immutable, almost as a natural rather than a historical phenomenon.    Although the ideological origins of these conceptions are now common knowledge, \u201cethnicity\u201d in pre-modern societies remains a much-debated issue. One of the most pertinent questions is whether an \u201cethnic\u201d identity existed and, if so, how it differs from other group identities. Other core questions to be discussed in the seminar are \u201cethnic identity\u201d and the concept of \u201ccultural memory\u201d, \u201cethnic identity and the archaeological record\u201d, \u201cethnicity and name-giving\u201d and \u201cethnicity and migrations\u201d. The seminar approaches these problems from a cross-cultural perspective, drawing on cases from the Ancient Near East to the Early Medieval Steppes in Inner Eurasia.    Reading will be in English and German. Permission of the professor is required.    Redrawing the Map: Art &amp; Archaeology of Northeast Asia in the First Millennium CE Sarah Laursen Thursdays 2:00-5:00 p.m. sarah.laursen@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010    This seminar will investigate the interrelationships between the arts of China, Korea, and Japan in the first millennium CE. We will first identify the historical political borders between these regions, and then compare them to the evidence provided by the material record. Key themes of ethnicity, religious affiliation, and the transfer of technology will be explored through case studies, such as the wall paintings in China\u2019s Han dynasty tombs, the shimmering gold jewelry of Korea\u2019s Three Kingdoms period, and the surviving traditional architecture of Japan\u2019s Asuka and Nara periods.    Chinese, Korean, or Japanese reading knowledge preferred. Permission of the professor is required.    Genealogies of the State: Polities in the Ancient World Roderick Campbell Wednesdays 2:00-5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3012 rbc2@nyu.edu    What is an \"ancient state\"? What assumptions about history are packed into the often heard but seldom explained phrase, \"state level society\"? In the first half this course we will explore the intellectual history of \"the state\" from early modern to 21st century theorists and the rise of the concept of \"the ancient state\" in 20th century archaeology. Armed with a genealogy of the state concept we will then turn to case studies of ancient polities and empires from antiquity. The case studies will be presented by a series of leading experts brought in as guest speakers.    This course will be reading intensive and interdisciplinary. There will likely be a contingent of faculty and post-docs as well as graduate students. Graduate students of disparate disciplines with an interest in deep-time political development are welcome. Prerequisites are interest, industry and imagination.    Permission of the professor is required.    Art &amp; Archaeology of Early Medieval China Lillian Tseng Mondays 2:00\u20135:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3013 lillian.tseng@nyu.edu    This seminar surveys diverse visual and material cultures from the 3rd to the 6 th centuries in China, a historical period marked by political division and ethnic integration. We will examine both transmitted and excavated objects, with special attention to their historical and archaeological contexts. Issues to discuss include ideology, identity, gender, and cultural interaction. Mediums to explore range from calligraphy, painting, architecture, sculpture, to ceramics, silverware, and glassware.    Reading knowledge of modern Chinese is required. Permission of the professor is required.    The Arab Conquests and the Worlds of Late Antiquity: Arabization, Arabicization, and Islamization Robert Hoyland Thursdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3014 kel306@nyu.edu    This course will examine the interaction between the Arab conquerors and the late antique worlds that they encountered.\u00a0 It will do so principally through the lens of contemporaries and near contemporaries rather than through that of ninth- and tenth-century Muslims, as is the usual practice.\u00a0 This is crucial for gaining a better understanding of the Middle East as it was when the Arabs first arrived in it as conquerors instead of as it came to be after a couple of centuries of their rule.\u00a0 A considerable amount of attention will be paid to the various polities that existed shortly prior to the conquests - the kingdoms of the Romanised Berbers, Nubians, Caucasian Albanians, Soghdians, Gurjarans etc - and the different ways in which they dealt with the invaders.    Spring 2012 Seminars \u00a0    Archaeologies of Production / Traditions of Making: Ancient China and Beyond Roderick Campbell Fridays 2:00 - 5:00 p.m. rbc2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010.001    This seminar will focus on an interdisciplinary study of production and the making of things in Early China using case studies from China as well as other parts of the world for comparison. The aim is to not only understand the history of Chinese production but also work toward a better understanding of making, innovation, creation and provisioning in human history.    Permission of the professor is required. Chinese language reading required unless instructor\u2019s permission is obtained first.    Dark Ages in the Eastern Mediterranean: The Aegean, Anatolia and the Levant 1200-800 BCE Lorenzo d'Alfonso Thursdays 9:00 a.m. -12:00 p.m. lda5@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013.001    The turn of the second Millennium BCE caused a dramatic caesura in the History of the Eastern Mediterranean. Before that passage Western Asia was divided into large territorial states characterized by the so called \u201cpalatial economy\u201d. After that passage, we face a great variety of new political entities in the Levant, which current research is bringing more and more to light. In the East the regional powers of Assyria and Babylon evolve into Empires. Although these are embedded in a much older tradition of representation of kingship and state organisation, the dimensions of their territories and of the military and administrative apparatus and propaganda also identify a clear distance from the previous era.    The course will reconsider the different hypotheses about the short process of profound change which took place at the end of the 13 th century and during the first half of the 12 th century BCE, and the following evolution until the end of the Dark Ages. The focus will be set on specific case studies in the Aegean, Anatolia and the Levant during that time, with a critical approach to the way these processes have been reconstructed.    Permission of the professor is required.    Writing, Law, Divination and Religion in the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00 - 5:00 p.m. bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014.001    Generally scholarship puts the cult of the gods at the center stage of religious systems in antiquity. This seminar takes a different approach investigating the origins of writing, law, and divination, to demonstrate their intricate relationship with each other, and only then with cultic practice as well as the theological meta-structures of religion.    We will explore the early clay tokens and their potential relationship with early signs written on the first archaic tablets, as well as their combination with counting systems in order to understand the emergence of writing. Such inventions are linked with the more general and universal cognitive capacities for object recognition, naming, and categorizing. Consequently, a further aspect of research will be concerned with the archaic and Early Dynastic lists and their organization.    In Mesopotamia, the earliest samples of writing (ca. 3100 BCE) represent contracts reflecting oral transactions, which evince the existence of a legal system regulating social and economic interaction. The conceptualization of legal norms, however, is attested only in the early royal edicts (ca. 2600 BCE) evincing the royal appropriation of the legal system into their ideological self-representation which again was framed by the larger religious system.\u00a0 By that time the three main areas of constitutional law, administrative law, and economic activities were covered by the royal decrees using an elaborate legal terminology, which is then appropriated by the specialists for divination. A major aspect of our inquiry will be investigating the notion of kittu , which is generally translated as \u2018truth,\u2019 and \u2018 d\u012bnu \u2018case, trial\u2019 and how they link law to divination and beyond, to the larger world view.    The compelling feature about Mesopotamian divination is not only its direct link with legislation as expressed in the use of judicial language but also with the cuneiform writing system. The cognitive process of transforming pathological forms observed on the liver into signs with cultural meaning which then are interpreted within a complex semiotic system show a similar cognitive process as the creation of writing. Both cultural systems, writing and divination, are dominated by the impact of the notion of drawing and writing to outline recognizable patterns, which can be traced back to representational prototypes. The question of representational prototypes then will lead us to understand cultural key metaphors of Mesopotamian religion.    Specialists for early writing (Gonzalo Rubio), law (Norman Yoffee), and cognitive sciences (Rita Watson) will lead some of the sessions and provide their expertise and insight to these questions.    Requirements: The research seminar is open to graduate students, visiting scholars, and faculty. Permission of the professor is required. Any primary sources will be provided with translations. Students are required to do short response papers to the readings and a presentation in combination with a written final paper. \u00a0    Cultural Interactions in Eurasian Art &amp; Archaeology Soeren Stark/Lillian Tseng Wednesdays 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. lillian.tseng@nyu.edu , soeren.stark@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3015.001    Cross-cultural inquiries over the Eurasian continent are still, to a considerable degree, hampered both by the fragmenting character of traditional academic divisions (such as Near Eastern, Central Asian, East Asian, South Asian studies) and considerable language barriers. Whereas the current academic divisions encourage the in-depth investigation of issues derived from the \u2018core areas\u2019, it does not facilitate the cross-border inquiry that addresses the interconnectedness between assumed \u2018core areas\u2019.    This seminar is intended to bridge academic gaps by exploring a wealth of cultural interactions between Central Asia and East Asia through a series of representative cases dated from the fifth century BCE to the ninth century CE. In the class we will revisit the so-called \u201cScythian animal style\u201d that embodied the art of the steppe stretching from Ukraine to Northern China. We will compare how the Han Chinese perceived the Northern \u2018barbarians\u2019 and how the Xiongnu elites expressed their cultural identity themselves by commissioning and consuming prestigious art objects. We will have a closer look at how Soghdian funerary practices and the related visual arts persisted or were subsequently altered in their trading colonies in Northern China. The class will tackle material culture of Tang China, its shaping and its impact on the T\u00fcrk Qaghanats in the northwest and on Japan in the east. Finally, we will also consider the religious factor in cultural interaction by examining Buddhist grottos in B\u0101miy\u0101n and Dunhuang.    Permission of the professor is required. Reading knowledge of German or French is recommended, but alternate English readings are available if necessary. \u00a0    Fall 2011 Seminars \u00a0    Archaeology and Historiography: Perspectives on Time, Space, Text and Material Roderick B. Campbell Mondays: 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. roderickbcampbell@gmail.com    Though treated as separate disciplines and usually housed in different departments, at the highest level history and archaeology share the common goal of understanding the human past. Nevertheless, in both theory and method, not only are archaeology and history internally diverse, but also frequently miles apart.    This seminar will embark on an interdisciplinary exploration of the historical sciences: their histories, philosophies and methodologies. Special focus will be on theories of time (change, tradition, process, event, etc.), space (physical space, place, landscape, etc.), text (context, genre, discourse, memory, etc.) and material (material culture, materiality, things, actor-networks, etc.)    The reading load in this course will be heavy. Permission of the instructor is required.    Scientific practices and practitioners in Greco-Roman society Alexander Jones Wednesdays: 1:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. alexander.jones@nyu.edu    This seminar will explore the contexts and conditions in which scientific research, practice, writing, and teaching were conducted in the Greco-Roman world from c. 500 BCE to c. 600 CE. While a broad and comprehensive conception of science cannot be applied to Classical antiquity, intellectual traditions involving a systematic approach to the description, explanation, and prediction of phenomena and the prescription of actions were interrelated in various ways, for example by sharing methods and theoretical frameworks, by having some of the same people as practitioners, or by serving analogous social functions. The principal focuses of the seminar will be the richly documented conditions of activity of physicians and medical theorists from the Hippocratic to the Imperial periods, and the more fragmentary and challenging evidence pertaining to mathematicians, astronomers, and astrologers. Students must have proficiency in ancient Greek, and reading knowledge of at least one of French, German, and Latin. Permission of the instructor required.    The Archaeology of the Egyptian Oases Roger Bagnall Thursdays: 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. roger.bagnall@nyu.edu    This seminar will center on the ISAW-sponsored excavations in the Dakhla Oasis in the western desert of Upper Egypt, including the ongoing excavations of Amheida and the excavations carried out in 2006-2008 at the smaller site of Ain el-Gedida. Most of the material excavated at these sites to date has belonged to the third and fourth centuries CE, but at Amheida occupation goes back to the Old Kingdom or earlier, and there are substantial remains of the pharaonic periods of the first millennium BCE. There will be a specific focus on the relationship of archaeological contexts and the objects found in them, particularly but not only objects bearing writing. Special attention will be paid to the problems of insecure contexts and the interpretation of finds coming from such contexts.    There will be reading in French, German, and Italian. Students must have proficiency in at least one language, preferably two. Permission of the instructor required.     Divinatory Texts in Ancient Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays: 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. bpl2@nyu.edu    This course is intended to provide an insight into omen literature of Mesopotamia. It includes a mix of scientific and literary texts that in their formal structure derive from omen literature. We will read through an array of primary sources including Old Babylonian liver models, Old Babylonian extispicy omina and Neo-Assyrian omina containing historical allusionas, a Neo-Assyrian tam\u012btu -text as well as excerpts from the celestial omen series Enuma Anu Enlil . The reading of literary predictive texts from the Neo-Assyrian and Hellenistic periods - Prophecy A and the Uruk Prophecy - will illuminate the dependency of historiographic prophecies on astrological omina.    Students must have had at least one year of Akkadian. Permission of the instructor required.    Spring 2011 Seminars \u00a0    Chronology, Calendars, and Astronomy Alexander Jones Fridays: 9:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. alexander.jones@nyu.edu    A selection of recent and current research on astronomy and practices of short-term and long-term time reckoning in ancient Old World civilizations, with particular focus on ancient Near Eastern, Greco-Roman, and related traditions.    Permission of the professor is required.       Shaping the Divine in the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.    In this seminar we will explore the nature of the divine in the ancient Near East. Concepts of the divine are based on the concept of the person, which, in Antiquity, differs from the modern notion of individual personhood. The individual was conceived as embedded in the community of the family and the tribe or city at large. Rather than as an individual, the person was seen as a type assuming a variety of roles and functions. Ancient notions of the body and the person play very much into the conceptualization of the divine. What is more, ancient Near Eastern religions conceive of the divine as a relative category, which beyond anthropomorphic deities can be extended to living rulers, dead rulers, ancestors, demons, cultic objects, statutes, and celestial bodies. This fluid notion of the divine allows for a continuous re-conceptualization and reconfiguration of the polytheistic systems and monotheism. What is more it provides an insight into the various ways of social bonding of human kind with the divine. Methodological approaches to ethology, anthropology and cognitive sciences will help us to understand the ancient notion of divinity.    Permission of the professor is required.          Archaeology of Consumption in the Ancient Near East Caroline Sauvage Wednesdays 10:00 a.m - 1:00 p.m    Belongings define our world, and somehow define the individuals possessing them. From the early Neolithic to the modern day, humans have produced objects. Production first sustained basic needs but then also catered to aesthetics by creating pleasing objects such as jewelry or wall paintings. Consumer goods were charged with cultural meaning: they contributed to individual self-definition and collective identity. They were used to express gender, project cultural ideals, respond to social changes, and express status and rank in local and international environments. Therefore, symbol and intrinsic value of goods, ideas and images shaped consumption: for instance, the notion of prestige was closely associated to rare, restricted or exotic goods. Desire for foreign material increased exchange of raw materials and finished products. Imitations of exotic objects contributed to a wider diffusion and trickle-down of restricted products. Different societies did not interpret objects and images the same way: sometimes imported products were used \u201cincorrectly\u201d, their materiality being more important than their effective function. This reveals an intricate interaction between product and audience.    This course will explore the relationships between cultures, identities and consumption of goods, ideas and images in Ancient Near Eastern contexts. Class discussions will build upon (1) theoretical readings, and (2) student presentations concerning specific examples of consumption in the Ancient Near East. In-class discussions will evaluate the relevance of theories as compared to actual data, the reasons for their discrepancies or accordance.    Permission of the professor is required.          Territorial Fortifications in the Old World Soeren Stark Thursdays 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.    The seminar aims at a broad cross-cultural survey of the phenomenon of territorial fortifications in the Old world from Britain up to Northern China, from the late 3rd Millennium BC up to the pre-Mongol Middle Ages in the beginning of the 13th century AD. However, the focus will be laid on the various territorial fortifications in Eastern Iran and Western Central Asia and on questions regarding possible functions of these fortifications. In particular, the course will deal with the concept of pre-modern \"frontiers\" and its various social, economic and political aspects.    Course assignments are a presentation of one specific topic (30%) together with a research paper of 20-25 pages (50%) and participation in discussions (20%). A reading knowledge of English is required. The session in week 5 will also deal substantially with literature in German, the session in week 9 and 10 with literature in Russian.    Permission of the professor is required.    Fall 2010 Seminars    Ancient Texts and Documents: Editing a didactic manuscript from Roman Egypt Roger Bagnall and Alexander Jones Tuesdays 2:00-5:00pm    The focus of this seminar will be an unpublished Greek papyrus codex (comprising 13 leaves) from the fourth century of our era containing geometrical and arithmetical problems and model contracts. The manuscript will be studied through high resolution digital images. Our principal object, occupying part of each seminar meeting, will be to constitute a critical text and commentary; thus participants will have in depth exposure to important aspects of paleography, papyrology, codicology, and current research in pedagogy, science, and adminstration in late antiquity. The study of the codex as artifact and text will also serve as a foundation for research presentations that may extend into a broader social and intellectual context.    The editorial portion of each seminar meeting will take up one leaf of the codex, following their presumed order, with time reserved for revising the preceding session's work. Each editorial session will include establishment of the text, translation, and construction of a provisional commentary. Assignment of research presentations and papers will be settled at the beginning of the course according to the interests and competences of the individual participants. Presenters will provide readings and specialized bibliography in advance of their sessions.    Knowledge of ancient Greek is required for this seminar. Permission of the professor(s) required.    Central Asia and the Mediterranean from the 6th c.BC to the 8th c. AD Soeren Stark Thursdays 2:00-5:00pm    The course will inquire into the relations between the Mediterranean and the various steppe and oasis cultures in Central Asia from the Achaemenid period up to the early Middle Ages. These relations are characterized by a broad spectrum of different forms of contact and exchange. Direct contacts were established, for example, by military campaigns, diplomatic exchanges, migrations or colonization. Less direct ways of cultureal intermediation resulted from complex transcontinental trade flows. The course will focus on the consquencess which different forms of communication with the Mediterranean had on Central Asian art and material culture. In doing so topics like urbanism, sacral architecture and religious iconographies, but also aspects of material culture (ceramics, arms, costume) will have to be discussed.    A reading knowledge of two of the languages (French, German, Russian) is required. Permission of the professor is required.    History, Memory, and Media in China Lillian Tseng Wednesdays 3:00-6:00 pm    The seminar explores how art objects shape memory and intervene in history in China. It first focuses on bronze vessels and stone steles, investigating how media, intention, and reception influence the operation of commemorative art. It then tackles calligraphy and painting, discussing how the fusion of personal memory and collective memory transforms the tangle of the past and the present.    Prominent cases to be studied include the Simuwu bronze vessel cast in the Shang (c. 1600\u2013c.1050 BCE), the bronze basin inscribed by Qiang in the Western Zhou (c. 1050\u2013771 BCE), the stone steles erected by the First Emperor of the Qin (r. 221\u2013210 BCE), and the Preface to Collected Poems from the Orchid Pavilion written by Wang Xizhi (303\u2013361 CE). Discussions extend to the reception of antiquity in the Song (960\u20131279) and the Qing (1644\u20131911) periods. Comparable western theories and examples will also be examined.    Knowledge of Chinese is not required. Permission of the professor is required.    Spring 2010 Seminars \u00a0    Archaeology and Texts: Complementary, Redundant, and Contradictory Roger Bagnall and Holly Pittman Thursdays 10:00am-12:00pm    This seminar will address the issues involved in using multiple kinds of evidence for the investigation of problems in the study of the ancient world. It is organized around case studies that each participant will contribute to the discussion. The first half of the seminar will discuss such topics as the value of myth in third millennium Mesopotamia in interpreting the contemporary archaeological record and the reconstruction of imperial structure through the analysis of textual and visual lists. Participants will be expected to present topics of problems of archaeology and text within their own fields of interest.    The Exact Sciences in Antiquity Alexander Jones Wednesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    Topic: Mathematics and Astronomy in Mesopotamia We will examine the reading, interpretation, and contextualization of mathematical cuneiform texts, especially of the Late Babylonian and Seleucid periods, and astronomical texts of the first millennium B.C., with particular emphasis on recently published texts and research.    Globalization of Knowledge in the Multilingual and Multi-ethnic Milieu of the Ancient Near East II Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    See description for first half of course, above.       Fall 2009 Seminars \u00a0    Globalization of Knowledge in the Multilingual and Multi-ethnic Milieu of the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    Cuneiform culture, originally invented in Sumer, dominated the entire region of the ancient Near East despite local, political, and cultural differences and despite the fact that in many cultures Sumerian or Akkadian did not represent the spoken language. Throughout three thousand years of history, the body of educational and scholarly texts remained more or less uniform. The professionalism reflected in the textual corpora speaks in favor of a virtual community of intellectuals. Scribes and scholars viewed themselves as an established community of users of a shared traditional knowledge which was acquired by means of a common curriculum. Owing to their control of information and knowledge these scholars played an essential role among the elites of society. The same is true for craftsmen who, in antiquity, showed great mobility, and who, because of their skills, were among the first to be deported during times of war.\u00a0 The seminar will explore the nature of knowledge as transmitted in the cuneiform tradition, the relationship between science and religion, the carriers of knowledge, i.e. the communities of scholars and scribes; libraries and the findspots of the scholarly material and what these tell us about scribal practices, training, and competences in regions that were distant from Mesopotamia. These investigations will serve to detect the human agency behind the texts and material culture and the relationship between texts, objects and persons. The goal is to obtain a better grasp of the cultural mechanisms and strategies of the spread of knowledge in antiquity.    The Exact Sciences in Antiquity Alexander Jones Wednesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    Topic: Greco-Roman astrology The seminar will be devoted to several aspects of the history of Greco-Roman astrology, including: (1) the evidence for its date and place of origin, (2) the practice of astrology from the Hellenistic period to late antiquity as reflected in papyri, artifacts, and medievally transmitted texts, and (3) Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos (or Apotelesmatika) and the ancient tradition of commentaries on that work.    Society, Economy, and Culture in Late Antiquity Roger Bagnall Thursdays, 10:00am-12:00pm    Presentation of current research in the society, economy, and culture of the Late Antique world, including the entire Roman world and the Near and Middle East.

                                             The Ancient World multidisciplinary concentration focuses on the shared and overlapping periods in the development of cultures and civilizations around the Mediterranean basin, in the Near East, and across central Asia to the Pacific Ocean.   Abu Dhabi's location at the center of this geographical expanse makes it an ideal site for exploring the intellectual and material riches of the ancient world. This concentration encompasses a number of disciplines, including archaeology, art history, history, literature, and philosophy. In addition to regular coursework, students may also have the opportunity to participate in an archaeological excavation.                             Requirements   Four courses, distributed across at least two disciplines and/or civilizations.     Students who elect this Multidisciplinary Concentration select four courses approved by their mentor. Students are also encouraged to take a course in archaeology or material culture. NYU operates several archaeological excavations, including in the Dakhla Oasis of Egypt and in Aphrodisias, in Turkey. This fieldwork requires special training, and admission is by application. Other archaeological fieldwork opportunities are available in the UAE and the region. Students can learn more about fieldwork opportunities by consulting with the Ancient World faculty.

We study the earliest human inventions such as spears and simple tools; ponder the methods that might have been used in the construction of monolithic structures such as Stone Henge, Egyptian obelisks, and pyramids; and explore examples of technological innovations that affected the course of human history. Throughout the course, the emphasis is on developing personal approaches to creativity and innovation by studying specific examples of these attributes from the ancient world.

Through their work, we will grapple with a range of pressing philosophical questions, including: Is happiness more than a subjective state of consciousness? Is death harmful? Do we have free will? Do we have obligations to others that override the pursuit of our own self-interest? What is the relation between the mind (or the soul) and the body? Since most of the philosophers we will be studying thought that philosophy must be systematic in its approach, we will also try to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this kind of approach to philosophical questions.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

BCE-4th cent. CE). S \u00f6ren Stark soeren.stark@nyu.edu Thursdays, 10:00am \u2013 1:00pm    The boom of Xiongnu archaeology in present-day Mongolia and Buriatia (Russia) during the past two decades has decisively shaped and improved our understanding of Late Iron age nomadic cultures in Eastern Central Asia. Ever since, new data (not least resulting from a more comprehensive application of scientific analyses) and new methodological approaches have considerably stimulated the discussion of aspects such as elite representation between Han China and the \u2018Hellenistic west\u2019, transfer of technologies (in and outside the steppes), or non-elite life-ways among pastoral societies in the area. At the same time, however, we dispose of a considerable mass of older data on nomadic \u2018cultures\u2019 from the territories of the former Soviet-Union, contemporary with the Xiongnu in Mongolia and Buriatia: the so-called \u2018Hunno-Sarmatian horizon\u2019. In many ways, this older data now awaits reconsideration in light of the recent advances in Mongolia and Buriatia. In addition, we see the rapid accumulation of new data from present-day Xinjiang, Gansu and Inner Mongolia (China), pertaining to the same cultural horizon.\u00a0 The aim of our seminar is to re-evaluate older data and to integrate it together with new data into a systematic, regionally structured overview of Late Iron Age pastoral cultures from the trans-Caspian steppes to Inner Mongolia (China), and from Southern Siberia to present-day northern Afghanistan. This will allow us to better understand regional specifics and supra-regional dynamics within and beyond the nomadic world of the \u2018Hunno-Sarmatian horizon\u2019 in an integrated way. And, it is hoped, it will help us to line out potential avenues for future research on pastoral \u2018cultures\u2019 in Central Eurasia during antiquity. Advanced reading knowledge of Russian or Chinese and permission of the instructor is required. \u00a0    ISAW-GA 3010 Art, Archaeology, and Museology Lillian Tseng, Jason Sun lillian.tseng@nyu.edu Thursdays, 2:00-5:00 pm    This seminar explores how museology facilitates the study of art and archaeology through an upcoming special exhibition on the Qin and Han Empires (221 BCE- 220 CE) in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. We will study the objects to be displayed and investigate the characteristics of early imperial Chinese art and archaeology. We will also learn how a museum functions as a cultural institution through the curatorial efforts in acquisitions, exhibitions, and publications, especially how research and diplomacy play significant roles in developing international exhibitions.    Prof. Lillian Tseng at ISAW and Dr. Jason Sun at the Metropolitan Museum of Art will teach the seminar together. The class will take place not only in a seminar room at ISAW but also in the storage rooms of the Museum.    Permission of the instructors required.    ISAW-GA 3013 Astrological Texts in Papyri and Medieval Manuscripts Alexander Jones alexander.jones@nyu.edu Wednesdays 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar will constitute an introduction to the fundamentals of Greco-Roman astrology and its transmission, through the study of selected texts and documents preserved in Greco-Egyptian papyri and medieval manuscripts.    Knowledge of ancient Greek and permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3014 Ritual Text and Ritual Performance in the ANE Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Among other media, culture is constituted and articulated also in cultural performances including ceremonies, festivals, theater, and games. Inspired by theater studies, in the eighties and nineties interdisciplinary research of ethnology, anthropology, religious studies, and historical studies concerned with cultural performance of any kind promoted the\u00a0 performative turn \u00a0by emphasizing the body and bodily action over the thought and mind. This move towards\u00a0 action , i.e. the\u00a0 doing \u00a0of things, entailed a move away from the text. More recently, anthropology and sociology sidestepped these mind/body, thought/action dichotomies by introducing the concept of social drama and emphasizing social interaction. Within the last decade ritual studies have turned towards a more precise definition of ritual versus theater and performance and have reintroduced the complex relationship between text and performance (see the research project\u00a0 Ritualdynamik: Soziokulturelle Prozesse in historischer und kulturvergleichender Perspektive \u00a0at the University of Heidelberg). The seminar\u00a0 Ritual Text and Ritual Performance\u00a0 pursues a similar direction by exploring the various forms of ritual texts transmitted in ancient Near Eastern literature; the relationship between ritual text and ritual performance, i.e. of whether and how far we are allowed to consider cuneiform ritual texts as scripts for the execution of ritual action; the role of narrative for ritual performance; the combination of incantation, prayer, and action within the ritual complex; the\u00a0 memoria -aspect of ritual constituting identity, order, and continuity.    We will combine the reading of primary sources with the theoretical approaches.    Requirements: Knowledge of Akkadian and permission of the instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3018 Archaeology of Anatolia from the Neolithic to the Hellenistic Period Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso lda5@nyu.edu Mondays, 2:00pm-5:00pm    Within Ancient Western Asia the archaeology of Anatolia has a specific position. Separated from Mesopotamia and the Levant by the imposing Tauros Mountains, Anatolia maintained communication, kept up with the developments taking place in the Fertile Crescent, and developed its own peculiar organization of complex group societies. Starting with the Neolithic, the course will explore the archaeological data reflecting the first evidence of social hierarchies and regional power, the development of metallurgy in the EBA, the creation of an empire in the mountains with a territorial organization, and the many and diverse developments and ultimate fall of this empire. We will then go on to look at the remains of then-new kingdoms of Phrygia and Lydia, already in direct contact with archaic Greece, as well as the impact of the Achaemenid conquest, up to the Hellenistic period. The course will offer an overview of the most important historical and archaeological themes connected with the ancient history of Anatolia; for each period, one key Anatolian site will presented with the scope to make students familiar with the relation between theory, historical reconstruction, and the rough archaeological data on which they are based.    Permission of the instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3020 The Discovery of Iranian Antiquity Daniel T. Potts daniel.potts@nyu.edu \u00a0 Tuesdays, 9am \u2013 12:00pm    The invention of printing in the late 15 th \u00a0century, coupled with increased traffic between European capitals and the Safavid court in the 16 th \u00a0and 17 th \u00a0centuries, resulted in a growth of interest in Iran\u2019s pre-Islamic past. Europeans visited major sites like Persepolis, Pasargadae and Naqsh-e Rustam; compared their situations with accounts in Classical sources; copied inscriptions; and brought portable antiquities back to their homelands. Enlightenment scholars (philologists, antiquarians, numismatists) of the 18 th \u00a0century worked assiduously on this material and established a substantial baseline of knowledge that served as a springboard for the better-known investigations, both archaeological and historical, of the 19 th \u00a0century. This course will look at what early modern Europeans contributed to the growth of Iranology.    Prerequisites: very good reading knowledge of French and German (ability to read Gothic script is an advantage). Permission of the instructor required.    ISAW-GA 3023 Mapping and Data Visualization for the Ancient World Sebastian Heath sh1933@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 10:00am -1:00pm    This course considers tools and methods for the effective communication of scholarly research through data-driven maps and the visualization of small and large datasets. By frequent hands-on use and demonstration of their work, students will gain confidence in using web-based tools as well as software that runs directly on their own computers. A constant focus will be the ability of such tools and software to import and export data in standard formats and to enable sharing of the maps and visualizations that students create. Accordingly, students will gain expertise in data interchange formats such as the Javascript Object Notation (JSON). Topics stressed over the course of the term will include the temporal component of spatial data as well as connectivity within data sets. We will also survey current approaches to the application of digital methods to historical and archaeological research and teaching. A particular outcome for students will be the ability to assess the relevance of both current and future tools for their own work. The majority of our examples will come from the ancient world as ISAW defines it, though students with other interests can enroll. It is expected that students will bring their own computers to class. While there are no prerequisites, participants should be willing to commit considerable time to rapidly gaining the technical skills that will be presented in class.

ISAW-GA 3003-001 Directed Study: Hittite Texts Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso lda5@nyu.edu Thursdays, 5:00-7:00pm (6 th \u00a0Floor Large Conference Room)    Hittite, the earliest Indo-European language, is attested on cuneiform tablets, and was created as a means of recording numerous and various types of information collected by the royal court of Hattusa, and by some other administrative centers on the periphery of the Great Kingdom of Hatti. In some cases different types of information were recorded in different textual genres, and because of cuneiform schooling it is not rare that different genres used a wider or more restricted number of cuneiform signs, values, as well as a different vocabulary, formulary or phrasary. The course aims at introducing the participants to the different types of texts written in Hittite. Each lesson will be devoted to transcription and translation of ca. 30 lines of one \u2018genre\u2019. Thus, a sample from the Hittite Laws, letters, treaties, edicts, annals, prayers, rituals, feasts, oracular inquiries, inventories, poems and mythic narratives will be transcribed and translated along the semester, and for each text genre a piece of secondary literature about form and/or content of the genre will be discussed by the class.    Prerequisites: an introductory course of Hittite Language (Hittite I) and permission of the instructor.    Fall Seminars 2014    The Exact Sciences in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages Alexander Jones Mondays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm alexander.jones@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3002    In this seminar we will examine episodes in the circulation of scientific knowledge and practices in the Mediterranean world (broadly conceived) from the third century CE to the end of the first millennium. The approach will be primarily through study of original texts, some of which will be chosen according to the specific interests and expertise of participants.    Knowledge of one or more of the relevant ancient languages (Greek in particular, Latin, Arabic, ...) is required. Permission of the instructor required.    Late Antique Documents Roger Bagnall Mondays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm roger.bagnall@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3007    The seminar will examine a series of papyrus archives from late antique Egypt and Palestine, mostly in Greek but with some documents partly or entirely in Latin, Coptic, and Arabic. The archives will range from villages to cities, private to public, and secular to monastic. Readings will be mostly of primary documents but also some modern discussions of the archives. The central focuses will be on the formation of what we call archives, their potential for historical study, and their limitations.    A reading knowledge of Greek and either French or German is required. Permission of the instructor required.    Art, Archaeology and Material Culture Lillian Tseng Wednesdays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm lillian.tseng@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010    This seminar explores various approaches that help us understand and elaborate the unearthed objects of extraordinary craftsmanship, a large corpus of fascinating material that has not yet been fully studied by archaeologists or art historians. The seminar seeks to strike a balance between methodological reflections and case studies. Theories and examples to be investigated are not limited to any specific cultural area.  Permission of the instructor required.    Early Chinese Literary Manuscripts Adam Schwartz Fridays, 1:00 \u2013 4:00pm acs21@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3012    This text-reading course will introduce the major corpora of newly discovered Early Chinese literary manuscripts and the philological methods fundamental to work with them.\u00a0 Readings will be from the Zhou through the Han, with focus on Warring States genre and popular readership, provincial scripts and stationery.    Permission of the instructor required.    Greek and Roman Portraiture Hallie Franks Mondays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm hmf2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013    This course will engage with critical issues that surround the study of ancient portraiture traditions in the Greek and Roman worlds. Some of the questions we will address over the course of the semester include: How do modern assumptions about the function and genre of portraiture, and its relationship to the subject, impact approaches to ancient material?\u00a0How do we develop a vocabulary for the different potential relationships between subject and visual product?\u00a0How do we think about intent, and what kinds of material provide context for interpretation?\u00a0How do portraits serve in public or private roles in different ways?\u00a0How can we use traditions of portraiture to think about ancient concepts of and expressions of various identities? This course deals primarily with classical material, but it also involves critical engagement with and analysis of the visual and the processes of contextualization.    Permission of the instructor required.    Advanced Reading of Akkadian: The Political and Cultural Relations between Assur and Babylon Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014-001    In addition to consolidating the knowledge of Akkadian grammar the Advanced Reading of Akkadian Class is designed to introduce into various dialects of Akkadian from a diversity of regions and periods and to familiarize the student with a diversity of paleographies as well as text categories. The text corpus to be studied will include royal inscriptions, letters, letters from gods to the king, and chronicles.    At least one year of Akkadian is required. Permission of the instructor required.    Advanced Reading of Akkadian: Incantations, Prayers, and Rituals Beate Pongratz-Leisten Thursdays 11:00am \u2013 1:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014-002    In addition to consolidating the knowledge of Akkadian grammar the Advanced Reading of Akkadian Class is designed to introduce into various dialects of Akkadian from a diversity of regions and periods and to familiarize the student with a diversity of paleographies as well as text categories. The text corpus to be studied will include incantations, prayers, and rituals from Ebla, Kanesh, Emar in Northern Syria as well as Assyrian and Babylonian cities.    At least one year of Akkadian. Permission of the instructor required.    Peoples and Lands of the Zagros: From Gutium to Ellipi Daniel T. Potts Tuesdays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm dtp2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3018    This seminar will examine the native peoples and regions of the Zagros mountain regions (Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Luristan) from their first appearance in cuneiform sources of the third millennium BC to the end of the Assyrian/Neo-Elamite period. Principle groups and regions that will be considered include Gutium, Simurrum, Lullubum, the Turukkaeans, Mannaea and Ellipi. The role of Ur III, Kassite, Assyrian and Urartian territorial ambitions in the region will be investigated as well as the nature of the landscape and the groups that inhabited it through time.    No formal requirements, but good reading knowledge of German and French would be helpful. Permission of the instructor required.    The Transition from Late Antiquity to Early Islam Robert Hoyland Tuesdays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm rgh2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3020-001    This course focuses on the question of what changed and what did not change in Near Eastern society in the course of the fifth to ninth centuries AD. \u00a0Consideration will be given to both the micro level (individual objects, themes, groups etc) and the macro level (was Pirenne right about the disruptive nature of the Arab conquests, is Becker's characterization of Islam as the culmination of late antique culture apt, etc). and to literary and archaeological themes and sources.    Permission of the instructor required.    The Body in the Ancient World Claire Bubb Wednesdays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm claire.coiro@gmail.com ISAW-GA 3020-002    This seminar will consider ancient understanding of and attitudes towards the human body. Our primary goal will be to trace the shifting conceptions of human physiology from Egyptian medical papyri to the Arabic tradition, with a heavy focus on the Greeks and Romans. How did cultures with strong taboos around the body form theories about the organs hidden within it? How did the ancients grapple with the brain, the nervous system, and the interrelationship of the soul and the body? How did the concept of the humors develop and what were the rival theories? How close did the Greeks come to understanding blood and the circulatory system and why did they miss its circular nature? Why did Galen\u2019s physiology come to dominate Western thought for centuries after his death, and how did the Arabic authors responsible for much of its transmission receive and respond to his theories? In order to understand the cultural context behind the development and evolution of these theories, we will also briefly consider religious, literary, and artistic treatment of the body, including burial customs, the centrality of the body to early Christianity, and the fascination with the body revealed across literary genres, particularly rhetoric and the novels.    Permission of the instructor required.    Spring 2014 Seminars \u00a0    Perspectives on the Ancient World in Medieval Islamic Histories Robert Hoyland Thursdays 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm rgh2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3020    In this course we will read from the works of a number of Muslim historians in order to ascertain their attitude, and that of Islamic civilization at large, towards the ancient world. \u00a0The aim will be to explore how the Islamic world situated itself with respect to past civilizations, why it favoured some past peoples over others, and how the forces of Time, Fate and God's will played a part in the evanescence of the past.    Arabic and permission of the instructor required.    Wall Paintings in Central Asia S\u00f6ren Stark &amp; Fiona Kidd Mondays 5:00 \u2013 8:00pm soeren.stark@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3009    Wall paintings constitute, since the 1 st millennium BCE, at least one of the major means employed to decorate architectural spaces of various sorts \u2013 religious (temples, monasteries), communal-palatial, private dwellings, tombs, etc. \u2013 throughout Central Asia. As such, murals constitute, in particular for the pre-Islamic period, one of the main categories of visual arts at our disposal. Yet wall paintings are not only significant for the study of art history in pre-Islamic Central Asia: in fact \u2013 and considering the near complete loss of other visual materials such as textile wall hangings and illuminated books, and the general scarcity of written sources \u2013 murals constitute a critical source for our understanding of the religious, social, economic and sometimes even political history of the area before the advent of Islam.    This class aims at a comprehensive overview of the most important sites and architectural ensembles with substantial wall painting remains in the area. Chronologically they range from the final centuries BCE to the 9 th /10 th century CE. Geographically we will focus on the regions of Choresmia, Sogdiana, Bactria-Tokh\u0101rist\u0101n and the Tarim basin. This will allow us to review difficult and still much-debated questions concerning the production of wall paintings in Central Asia. Those include questions regarding the significance of regional styles as evidence for regional schools and itinerant workshops, the social and economic background of artists and patrons, ways of transfer of artistic models, and regional variances regarding cultural preferences in elite representation.    Permission of the instructor required.    Literature and the Question of Genre in the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014    In the last decades the category of \u2018literature\u2019 in the Ancient Near East has come repeatedly under scrutiny. It included among other topics fierce discussions about how to define the literary corpus, orality and aurality, the notion of genre, the validity of historical references in literary works and the fluid boundaries between \u2018literature\u2019 and \u2018historiography,\u2019 where to locate literary production - school, temple, or palace, and how far the production process determined functional and pragmatic aspects of literary works.    To isolate literature from its historical context as l\u2019art pour l\u2019art aesthetics favoring formalistic features over pragmatic and historical concerns certainly does not do justice to ancient literary works. While formalistic features such as the use of literary dialects might operate as a way of categorization, recently, due to the nature of the texts, narratology as well as fictionality have been considered equally important. Literature rather should be defined as a particular medium alongside other media as part of the social and cultural discourse. Moreover, what makes an oeuvre historically significant, is not necessarily established by the qualities of the work or by the author but by its history of reception and its intertextuality and intermediality. The seminar investigates what constituted literary works, how literary works became part of the stream of tradition, were affected by and affected historical conditions, and entered intertextual and intermedial relations.    Knowledge of Akkadian and permission of the instructor required.    Dilmun, Magan, and Meluhha Daniel T. Potts **This is a condensed seminar. The class will meet twice a week from January 27 \u2013 March 18; Mondays 1-4pm and Tuesdays 9am-12pm** dtp2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3018    Third millennium cuneiform sources refer to three lands associated with the 'Lower Sea' (Persian Gulf): Dilmun, in the northern and central Gulf, centered on Bahrain, the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and Failak (Kuwait); Magan, in the Oman peninsula; and Meluhha, conventionally identified with the Harappan civilization in the Indus Valley. In this seminar we will examine the archaeological and cuneiform sources from and about this region, paying particular attention to the period c. 6000 BC to the 1st century AD. The seminar will emphasize local developments in the region, including both funerary and settlement data, and evidence of inter-regional contact (ceramics, stone vessels, metals, semi-precious stones).    Permission of the instructor required.    Greco-Roman Astrology and Astronomy and the Antecedents Alexander Jones Mondays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm alexander.jones@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3002    This seminar will be an introduction to the goals, methods, and practices of Greek mathematical astronomy during the period from the second century BCE through the second century CE (essentially from Hipparchus to Ptolemy) and to the Greco-Roman astrology that depended on this astronomy. Sources will include texts transmitted via medieval manuscripts (e.g. Ptolemy's works in Greek and Arabic), papyri, and presumed adaptations of Greek astronomy and astrology in other traditions such as those of India. Particular attention will be paid to the Greek reception and modification of elements of astronomy and astrology from Mesopotamia and Egypt.    Knowledge of Greek or other languages significant for these traditions and permission of the instructor required.    Landscapes and Territoriality in Western and Eastern Asia BCE Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Roderick Campbell Wednesdays 9:30am \u2013 12:30pm lda5@nyu.edu , rbc2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3012    How is place and landscape conceived in times and places before nation states, maps and national borders? What, if any, notions of territoriality were in operation in ancient polities like the Shang kingdom at Anyang or the Neo-Hittite polities of Anatolia? How are they linked to such concepts as community, town/city, and land? And on the other hand, how do modern scholars reconstruct landscapes and territoriality of ancient polities?    The course will approach these and similar questions dividing between classes on theory where some basic methodological contributions are discussed, and classes devoted to case studies, where specific aspects are dealt with in well-defined historical context.    At lease one foreign language and permission of the instructor required. \u00a0    Early Chinese Epigraphy: Bones, Bronze, and Bamboo Roderick Campbell and Adam Schwartz Thursdays 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm rbc2@nyu.edu , acs21@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010    In this course students will acquire a foundation in epigraphic methodology and work through a selection of epigraphic texts from Shang through Warring States times. Fundamental epigraphic training will include an understanding of the basic principles of Chinese graph formation as well as the fundamentals of phonological, morphological and syntactic reconstruction. Consideration of writing media, context and register will also be addressed. Familiarity with corpus access (through compendium, on-line databases, etc.) and resources (dictionaries, concordances, etc.) will form part of the training on each corpus discussed. The main corpuses of excavated texts will be Shang oracle-bone inscriptions, Shang and Western Zhou bronze inscriptions, and Eastern Zhou bamboo slips. We will attempt to cover a wide range of genres with an eye to giving students as broad a paleographic base as possible.    Coursework will consist of weekly assignments \u2013 usually in the form of translations and preparation to read specific texts in common. The final course assignment will be the annotated translation of a text of reasonable size and complexity.    Ability to read classical Chinese and permission of instructors required. \u00a0    Maps, Models, and Databases: Digital Tools for the Ancient World Sebastian Heath Wednesdays 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm sebastian.heath@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013    Our goal in this course is to gain hands-on skills with the digital tools that are changing the nature of research and the publication of scholarship related to the Ancient World. The focus is material culture and throughout the term students will work with free tools that enable sharing of results. Students will not only learn how to make 3D models of objects in museum collections, but also how to choose open formats that let one publish those models on the Internet. Google Maps and Earth will play a prominent role, and students will also use the more capable web-based GIS CartoDB ( http://cartodb.com ). A goal will always be to explore how these tools can work together to make innovative presentations of scholarly research. Other topics include the role of open licenses in modern scholarship, database structures appropriate for capturing the heterogeneity of ancient material culture, network analysis, the geographic component of ancient primary sources, and the deployment of Linked Open Data. Throughout the term students will evaluate both cloud-based tools and downloadable software, while also reviewing websites and digital publications that provide access to important resources. Students will gain an ability to use current tools as well as the confidence to assess new tools as they become available in the future. This course will be of particular interest to students needing to incorporate digital manifestations of material culture into their dissertations or other scholarly work. \u00a0    Fall 2013 Seminars \u00a0    Public Health in the Ancient World Roger Bagnall and Roderick Campbell Mondays 2:00-5:00 p.m. roger.bagnall@nyu.edu ; rbc2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3022    Revolutionary developments in the biological sciences, accompanied as well by discoveries in the physical sciences, have opened up possibilities for study of the human past unimaginable a generation ago. To long-established methods dependent on description and quantification have been added technologies that allow us to find out, for example, whether people buried at Rome were also born and raised there, or what kind of carbohydrates dwellers of an Egyptian oasis were eating. The routes of transmission of plant species can be seen as never before; modern demographic techniques like model life tables have given new life to ancient demography, once a laughingstock; scientific excavation of arid sites coupled with new technologies has produced information on morbidity and mortality unobtainable until now. We have now the opportunity to begin to put together a comprehensive sense of the factors of health over the vast span of human history we call antiquity, while at the same time study changing, collective human responses to disease, nutrition, risk and ultimately, mortality.    This course will have a symposium format with different specialists each week presenting on a range of topics from paleopathology to ancient demography. In addition to weekly response papers students will write a final paper relating one or more of the symposium\u2019s topics to the overarching theme of public health in the ancient world.    Permission of the instructor required.    Iranian Archaeology in the 21 st Century Daniel T. Potts Tuesdays 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm daniel.potts@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3018    The publication of recent excavations (post-2000) in journals like Iran , Iranica Antiqua and Arch\u00e4ologische Mitteilungen aus Iran und Turan , as well as in monographs and conference volumes (published inside and outside of Iran) has resulted in a significant addition to our knowledge of Iranian archaeology in all periods of the pre-Islamic past. Accessing that new data and integrating it with what was already known is not always easy, however. This seminar will involve close reading of the past 13 years of scholarship in Iranian archaeology with an emphasis on primary publications of excavations and museum collections (rather than secondary literature). The aim will be to evaluate this new material and assess how it fits in with what was already known about the relevant site, region and/or period; consider where it challenges previous beliefs; and discuss what new questions it raises.    Permission of the instructor required.    Hittite History, Language &amp; Archaeology Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso Mondays, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm lda5@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013    The Hittite empire had a profound impact on the history of Pre-classical Western Asia. After a period defined by the presence of local principalities, and a formative phase in the 17 th century, a complex political machine developed in Central Anatolia. The creation of a system of large structures for containment of water and seeds allowed local societies to overcome for the first time the regional challenges resulting from the weather and landscape. These important structures are part of a comprehensive approach to complex social life, whose effects became concretely observable in the so-called Early Empire. In this period, for example, normative texts were produced, some defining the administrative function of the capital and peripheral districts, some \u2013what we call rituals and feasts-, defining the cultic activity between the core to the periphery, and the syncretic pantheon. The tension between the \u201c possible empire \u201d emerging from these texts and the local developments produced by various actors can be understood through the lens of the historical context in which the empire operated for almost 500 years. The course aims at providing participants with basic information and updated research on the Hittites. Each class will be divided into two parts: one touching different themes of the history and archaeology of the Hittites; the other providing an introduction into the Hittite language and script.    Participation 30%; one presentation during course 40%; final written exam 30% (no final paper)    Requirements: one foreign language: either French, Italian or German    Permission of the instructor required.    Introduction to GIS &amp; Spatial Analysis in Anthropology &amp; Archaeology Emily Hammer Wednesdays 9:30am \u2013 12:30pm ehammer@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3012 \u2013 Class takes place at 24 Waverly Place, Rm. 668    This course aims to provide a basic understanding of how remote sensing data (satellite imagery and aerial\u00a0photographs) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to visualize, analyze, and integrate\u00a0archaeological, anthropological, historical, environmental, and hydrological data. \u00a0It also aims to introduce students to the process\u00a0of designing and carrying out a spatial research project. \u00a0Students will learn basic techniques for acquiring,\u00a0manipulating, and creating geospatial data in several forms, including pixel-based satellite imagery and digital\u00a0terrain models as well as point, line, and polygon representations of data. \u00a0Each week, these techniques will be\u00a0applied to sample archaeological data and also to data from a region/topic chosen by the student. \u00a0In addition to lab-based work, students will learn basic field techniques of field survey, including how to navigate and record using a\u00a0Global Positioning System (GPS) handheld receiver, how to integrate GPS data into a GIS database, and how to\u00a0produce maps for fieldwork and publication. \u00a0The course will use ESRI's ArcGIS software.    Permission of the instructor required.    Time in Greco-Roman Antiquity: Texts and Material Culture Alexander Jones Thursdays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm alexander.jones@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3002    In the ancient Greek and Roman world time was initially flexible, inexact, and tied to the natural environment. The risings and settings of the Sun, the phases of the Moon, and the cycle of the seasons supplied the basic framework of days, months, and years by which people organized daily life, commerce, religion, and government. However, astronomers, mathematicians, mechanicians, and scholars developed increasingly precise ways of measuring, organizing, and keeping track of time. This seminar will investigate the varied technologies and practices of time management known from textual sources and artifacts, and the interaction between the development of these technologies and practices and the awareness and representation of measured time in Greco-Roman society.    Permission of the instructor required.    Advanced Reading of Akkadian - Literary Texts in Ancient Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00 \u2013 5:00pm bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014    This course is intended to provide an insight into the corpus of literary texts of Mesopotamia. It includes a mix of poems, epics, and myths, the Agushaya Hymn, Tukulti-Ninurta Epic, the Erra Epic, Anzu Myth and Etana Myth, just to name a few. Most of these texts come in various versions from different periods thus allowing for investigating their transmission through time. They are written in the Hymnic-Epical Dialect or the Standard Babylonian dialect. Consequently, beyond acquiring knowledge of great Mesopotamian literary works, the students will train in reading these literary dialects. At least one year of Akkadian is required.    Permission of the instructor required.    Spring 2013 Seminars \u00a0    Transmission of Ancient Science into Arabic Robert Hoyland Thursdays 2:00 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3002 rgh2@nyu.edu    The aim of this course is to explore the different paths along which knowledge of Antiquity passed into Muslim intellectual culture and how it was received and interpreted. \u00a0The focus will not just be on the so-called translation movement, but also the broader question of how pre-Islamic histories and cultures fared in the Middle East after the Arab conquests. \u00a0A core part of the course will be reading original Arabic texts and assessment will be via a final paper that must involve study of extracts from Arabic texts.    Permission of the instructor required.    Greek Texts on Mechanics Alexander Jones Mondays 1:00 p.m. \u2013 4:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3007 alexander.jones@nyu.edu    A selection of Greek mechanical texts, including Pappus of Alexandria's \"Introduction to Mechanics\" (Book 8 of his Synagoge ) and Heronian works from the \"Mynas Codex\" ( Par. suppl. gr. 607) will be studied on the basis of medieval manuscripts, with particular attention to the manuscript diagrams.    Knowledge of ancient Greek is required. Permission of the instructor required.    \u201cSoghdians in their Homeland\u201d \u2013 the Archaeology of Soghdia from ca. 600 BCE to ca. 750 CE S\u00f6ren Stark Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 2:00 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m; March 26 \u2013 May 9 ISAW-GA 3009 soeren.stark@nyu.edu    Spectacular finds and a general interest in Old World connectivity has in recent years sparkled much interest in Soghdians abroad, in particular in their colonies along the so-called Silk Roads and in the Chinese plains. Much less attention has been paid, outside a small scholarly circle, to their homeland at the banks of the rivers Zerafshan and Kashka-Darya (in present-day Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) \u2013 with the result that the discussion of \u201cSoghdians along the Silk Roads and in China\u201d is often based on too imprecise (sometimes even wrong) assumptions about their \u2018original\u2019 cultural traditions.    Particularly regrettable is a certain tendency to use the term \u201cSoghdian\u201d almost in a generic way, subsuming everything \u201cIranian\u201d east of the Iranian plateau under one fashionable label. This seminar aims for some clarification on this issue by systematically and comprehensively assessing our current knowledge on the archaeology of Soghdia, from the dawn of constitutive cultural features in the region during the pre-Achaemenid Iron Age to the incorporation of Soghdia into the Dar al-Islam in the course of the 8th century. The approach will be micro-regional, that is we will follow the main trends of development regarding settlement patterns, site typology, architecture, ceramic, metal and textile production, as well as burial costumes and visual arts for each micro-region separately \u2013 as far as possible. This is an ambitious aim that has not been undertaken in a systematic way. As a result, it is hoped, we will be able to not only distinguish more precisely \u201cSoghdian\u201d cultural features from those associated with Khorezmia, Ferghana, Bactria or Sasanian Iran, but also to perceive intra-regional variations and trends.    This seminar is held intensively from March 26 th \u2013 May 9 th . Russian and permission of the instructor is required.    The Art of Antiquity in the Metropolitan Museum: A Global Perspective Lillian Tseng/Paul Zanker Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 3:00pm-6:00pm January 29 - March 14 ISAW-GA 3012 lillian.tseng@nyu.edu    This seminar explores the collections of Ancient art in the Metropolitan Museum with a global perspective. It seeks to clarify the distinct features of art objects produced in the Greco-Roman World and in Early China through contrast and comparison. Mediums to be studied range from sculpture, pictorial arts to decorative arts. Topics to be discussed include heroes, deities, mythology, auspiciousness, monumentality, and femininity.    The seminar encourages students to establish direct connections with objects. All classes meet in the galleries or storerooms of the Museum. The seminar is led by Lillian Tseng and Paul Zanker. Dr. Zanker is the author of Roman Art (J. Paul Getty Museum, 2010) and Pompeii: Public and Private Life (Harvard University Press, 1998).    This seminar is held intensively from January 29 th to March 14 th . The first class meets in the lecture hall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. No languages are required.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Beyond Apogee and Collapse: Empires and other Polities in the Ancient World (BCE) Roderick Campbell/Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso Fridays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3013 rbc2@nyu.edu , lda5@nyu.edu    \u201cThe fall of the Assyrian empire\u201d; \u201cthe collapse of the Mayan civilization\u201d \u2013 the idea of collapse fascinates the contemporary imagination, conjuring images of melancholy ruins and vanished civilizations. The apogee of empires is what is generally contrasted with the post-collapse situation, but what of everything in between? When researchers detach their gaze from successful military deeds, or abrupt changes in the archaeological record, a sort of skepticism on the consistence and the sense of ancient polities occurs, and lower scale social organization \u2013urban, kin, or primary production based, appears as the main \u2018real\u2019 elements defining the scenario.    The course will discuss how empires and other polities of the ancient world (4 th to 1 st millennium BCE) operate over the long-term. \u00a0On the basis of more recent studies, it will reconsider the concepts of \u201capogee\u201d and \u201ccollapse\u201d as embedded in a more dynamic understanding of historical processes. These and similar questions about the nature and functioning of ancient political forms over time will be the focus of the seminar, divided in a group of classes on theoretic approaches, followed by a series of case studies.    SYLLABUS    Permission of the instructor is required.    Arabia in Antiquity c. 3500 BCE \u2013 750 CE George Hatke Tuesdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3018 geh2@nyu.edu    While ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Syria-Palestine have been the subject of scholarly investigation for the better part of two centuries, the Arabian Peninsula remains an understudied region by historians and archaeologists alike. This results not only from the difficulties of traveling to, and conducting research in, Arabia, but also from a long-standing view that ancient Arabia was little more than a peripheral region of the Near East whose nomadic tribes periodically migrated into more northerly regions but which had little history of its own.    This seminar seeks to demonstrate that, far from being peripheral to the ancient Near East, the Arabian Peninsula was in fact an axis of the Near Eastern, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean worlds and must therefore be considered an integral part of antiquity. From this broader perspective, such developments in ancient Arabian history as the diffusion of Semitic languages, the rise of state societies, the growth of long-distance trade, and ultimately the spread of monotheistic tradition(s) will be studied against the backdrop of the political, social, economic, and cultural history of the ancient world at large. In this way students of antiquity will learn how to interpret and evaluate evidence for contact between cultures, using the Arabian Peninsula as a case study. Particular emphasis will be placed on three key regions of Arabia: 1) South Arabia and the Red Sea, 2) East Arabia and the Persian/Arabian Gulf, and 3) the desert frontier of the Fertile Crescent that constitutes North Arabia. The timeframe of the seminar extends from the Early Bronze Age (beginning in the mid-fourth millennium BCE) to the Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE).    Among the questions that will be dealt with in this seminar are: 1) What role did agriculture and trade play in ancient Arabian society, and what evidence survives of these two facets of the Arabian economy? 2) To what extent were ancient Arabian politics shaped by external political and economic factors? How and why did some foreign polities (e.g. the Ethiopian kingdom of Aksum and the S\u0101s\u0101nid Empire of Iran) establish spheres of influence while no Arabian polity expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula until the seventh century CE? 3) Who were the Arabs and what made them different from other Arabian peoples? Is it possible to speak of the Arabs as a single, coherent group in pre-Islamic times? 4) How did monotheistic traditions reshape Arabian society during Late Antiquity (c. 200-700 CE)? Why did Islam emerge when it did, and why in Arabia, as opposed to another desert region like the Sahara?    Permission of the instructor required.    Relations between Mesopotamia &amp; Iran Daniel T. Potts Wednesdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3019 kel306@nyu.edu    This seminar will consider a variety of issues in the archaeology of Mesopotamia and Iran from late prehistory through the end of the Bronze Age. Some of those issues will be examined in a synchronic fashion while others will be investigated diachronically. Accounting for changes in material culture and cultural practices, as well as continuities, is a constant theme in much archaeological research, sometimes centering around specific domains of material culture or cultural activity, sometimes taking a more global approach. This year\u2019s seminar will examine a range of different issues diachronically. The intention is to initiate a discussion around the role of technology and demography as variables which impact upon the continuities and changes that are attested in a number of different domains.    This course poses a series of key questions of a series of cultural domains and practices attested in Mesopotamia and Iran (6 th -2 rd millennia BC), with a view to charting structural continuities and discontinuities through time. The appropriateness of technological and social explanations of these phenomena will be discussed and evaluated.    Knowledge of French and/or German required. Permission of the instructor required.    The History of Assyria in Ancient and Modern Historiography Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3020 bpl2@nyu.edu    This seminar is not geared towards an event-oriented history of Assyria. Its also not concerned with the social science oriented history including quantitative sociological and economic history modeled after the natural sciences and its claim for objective truth. Rather than a history from below, the emphasis is on the study of the textual production as it related to or occurred at the Assyrian courts throughout their history and on how ancient historiography proceeded from facts or empirical events to create a coherent story about the deeds of the king that met the expectations linked with the office of rulership, which were informed by a longstanding tradition and the world view of the time. We will educate ourselves as to how to interpret the various text genres that Assyriologists have classified as chronicles and annals by critically re-evaluating our modern taxonomy applied to the ancient texts and explore how these \u2018genres\u2019 interface with what we tend to subsume under fiction and literature. In addition to such critical attitude toward the text, informed by postmodern literary theory and linguistics, linguistic features of the ancient texts and the shape of the tablet as well as the context of the text will illuminate our interpretation of the ancients\u2019 intentionality. We will explore to what degree the writings were indeed concerned with the past, what the inserting of \u2018historical factual data\u2019 was aiming at and further critically evaluate the assumption that history needs always to be written in a narrative.    The goal of the seminar is threefold: 1) to familiarize ourselves with the various text categories, 2) to acquire knowledge in the various dialects of the Assyrian language as well as in the \u2018hymnic epical dialect\u2019 by reading primary sources related to the general discussion and 3) to acquire an insight into the cultural and intellectual setting in which historiography was written by the ancient scholars for the political elites.    The reading of Akkadian texts related to the seminar will be complemented by a further tutorial on Thursday 11AM - 1PM.    As in former years the seminar will be concluded with a workshop. This year\u2019s participants:\u00a0 Jean-Jacques Glassner; Peter Machinist; Piotr Michalowski, and Nele Ziegler. Akkadian is required for those who attend the reading sessions.    Permission of the instructor required.    Pottery and Empire in the Roman Mediterranean Sebastian Heath Wednesdays 2:00 p.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3021 sebastian.heath@nyu.edu    This course surveys the types of pottery available in the Roman-period Mediterranean and encourages students to consider how that material contributes to the study of large-scale economic and political history, as well as its contribution to focused questions of individual consumer experience and the interpretation of specific archaeological contexts. Students will gain familiarity with the basic vocabulary and techniques of ceramic study while always asking why this material is important to understanding the Roman Empire. The majority of the readings concern the Eastern Mediterranean, but we will consider the Mediterranean as a unit.\u00a0 Some titles in the required readings are drawn from fields entirely outside the ancient Mediterranean. Students will be able to explore specific regions or issues within the study of Roman pottery in their research paper.    Permission of the instructor required.    Fall 2012 Seminars     Introduction to Papyrology    Roger Bagnall Tuesdays 2:00-5:00 p.m. roger.bagnall@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3007    This seminar will introduce students to both technical and substantive sides of papyrology. It will read a representative selection of published papyri from the Hellenistic, Roman, and Late Antique periods, with an emphasis on the interpretive challenges posed by documentary evidence; and students will learn to decipher Greek handwritings and prepare a critical edition of a papyrus.    A knowledge of Greek is required; Latin and Coptic would be useful, and there will be readings in French and German. Permission of the professor is required.    Conceptions of Ethnicity in the Ancient World Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Soeren Stark Wednesdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. lda5@nyu.edu , soeren.stark@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3009    The problem of ethnicity is a recurring and widely discussed topic in studies related to a wide range of pre-modern societies and cultures. Historical conceptions, rooted in national movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have taken for granted that terms like \u201cpeople\u201d, \u201ctribe\u201d, etc. refer to racially and culturally homogeneous groups, sharing a common descendance and destiny, speaking the same language and living within one state. In this way, \u201cpeoples\u201d (and not individuals or social groups) were seen as something immutable, almost as a natural rather than a historical phenomenon.    Although the ideological origins of these conceptions are now common knowledge, \u201cethnicity\u201d in pre-modern societies remains a much-debated issue. One of the most pertinent questions is whether an \u201cethnic\u201d identity existed and, if so, how it differs from other group identities. Other core questions to be discussed in the seminar are \u201cethnic identity\u201d and the concept of \u201ccultural memory\u201d, \u201cethnic identity and the archaeological record\u201d, \u201cethnicity and name-giving\u201d and \u201cethnicity and migrations\u201d. The seminar approaches these problems from a cross-cultural perspective, drawing on cases from the Ancient Near East to the Early Medieval Steppes in Inner Eurasia.    Reading will be in English and German. Permission of the professor is required.    Redrawing the Map: Art &amp; Archaeology of Northeast Asia in the First Millennium CE Sarah Laursen Thursdays 2:00-5:00 p.m. sarah.laursen@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010    This seminar will investigate the interrelationships between the arts of China, Korea, and Japan in the first millennium CE. We will first identify the historical political borders between these regions, and then compare them to the evidence provided by the material record. Key themes of ethnicity, religious affiliation, and the transfer of technology will be explored through case studies, such as the wall paintings in China\u2019s Han dynasty tombs, the shimmering gold jewelry of Korea\u2019s Three Kingdoms period, and the surviving traditional architecture of Japan\u2019s Asuka and Nara periods.    Chinese, Korean, or Japanese reading knowledge preferred. Permission of the professor is required.    Genealogies of the State: Polities in the Ancient World Roderick Campbell Wednesdays 2:00-5:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3012 rbc2@nyu.edu    What is an \"ancient state\"? What assumptions about history are packed into the often heard but seldom explained phrase, \"state level society\"? In the first half this course we will explore the intellectual history of \"the state\" from early modern to 21st century theorists and the rise of the concept of \"the ancient state\" in 20th century archaeology. Armed with a genealogy of the state concept we will then turn to case studies of ancient polities and empires from antiquity. The case studies will be presented by a series of leading experts brought in as guest speakers.    This course will be reading intensive and interdisciplinary. There will likely be a contingent of faculty and post-docs as well as graduate students. Graduate students of disparate disciplines with an interest in deep-time political development are welcome. Prerequisites are interest, industry and imagination.    Permission of the professor is required.    Art &amp; Archaeology of Early Medieval China Lillian Tseng Mondays 2:00\u20135:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3013 lillian.tseng@nyu.edu    This seminar surveys diverse visual and material cultures from the 3rd to the 6 th centuries in China, a historical period marked by political division and ethnic integration. We will examine both transmitted and excavated objects, with special attention to their historical and archaeological contexts. Issues to discuss include ideology, identity, gender, and cultural interaction. Mediums to explore range from calligraphy, painting, architecture, sculpture, to ceramics, silverware, and glassware.    Reading knowledge of modern Chinese is required. Permission of the professor is required.    The Arab Conquests and the Worlds of Late Antiquity: Arabization, Arabicization, and Islamization Robert Hoyland Thursdays 9:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. ISAW-GA 3014 kel306@nyu.edu    This course will examine the interaction between the Arab conquerors and the late antique worlds that they encountered.\u00a0 It will do so principally through the lens of contemporaries and near contemporaries rather than through that of ninth- and tenth-century Muslims, as is the usual practice.\u00a0 This is crucial for gaining a better understanding of the Middle East as it was when the Arabs first arrived in it as conquerors instead of as it came to be after a couple of centuries of their rule.\u00a0 A considerable amount of attention will be paid to the various polities that existed shortly prior to the conquests - the kingdoms of the Romanised Berbers, Nubians, Caucasian Albanians, Soghdians, Gurjarans etc - and the different ways in which they dealt with the invaders.    Spring 2012 Seminars \u00a0    Archaeologies of Production / Traditions of Making: Ancient China and Beyond Roderick Campbell Fridays 2:00 - 5:00 p.m. rbc2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3010.001    This seminar will focus on an interdisciplinary study of production and the making of things in Early China using case studies from China as well as other parts of the world for comparison. The aim is to not only understand the history of Chinese production but also work toward a better understanding of making, innovation, creation and provisioning in human history.    Permission of the professor is required. Chinese language reading required unless instructor\u2019s permission is obtained first.    Dark Ages in the Eastern Mediterranean: The Aegean, Anatolia and the Levant 1200-800 BCE Lorenzo d'Alfonso Thursdays 9:00 a.m. -12:00 p.m. lda5@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3013.001    The turn of the second Millennium BCE caused a dramatic caesura in the History of the Eastern Mediterranean. Before that passage Western Asia was divided into large territorial states characterized by the so called \u201cpalatial economy\u201d. After that passage, we face a great variety of new political entities in the Levant, which current research is bringing more and more to light. In the East the regional powers of Assyria and Babylon evolve into Empires. Although these are embedded in a much older tradition of representation of kingship and state organisation, the dimensions of their territories and of the military and administrative apparatus and propaganda also identify a clear distance from the previous era.    The course will reconsider the different hypotheses about the short process of profound change which took place at the end of the 13 th century and during the first half of the 12 th century BCE, and the following evolution until the end of the Dark Ages. The focus will be set on specific case studies in the Aegean, Anatolia and the Levant during that time, with a critical approach to the way these processes have been reconstructed.    Permission of the professor is required.    Writing, Law, Divination and Religion in the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00 - 5:00 p.m. bpl2@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3014.001    Generally scholarship puts the cult of the gods at the center stage of religious systems in antiquity. This seminar takes a different approach investigating the origins of writing, law, and divination, to demonstrate their intricate relationship with each other, and only then with cultic practice as well as the theological meta-structures of religion.    We will explore the early clay tokens and their potential relationship with early signs written on the first archaic tablets, as well as their combination with counting systems in order to understand the emergence of writing. Such inventions are linked with the more general and universal cognitive capacities for object recognition, naming, and categorizing. Consequently, a further aspect of research will be concerned with the archaic and Early Dynastic lists and their organization.    In Mesopotamia, the earliest samples of writing (ca. 3100 BCE) represent contracts reflecting oral transactions, which evince the existence of a legal system regulating social and economic interaction. The conceptualization of legal norms, however, is attested only in the early royal edicts (ca. 2600 BCE) evincing the royal appropriation of the legal system into their ideological self-representation which again was framed by the larger religious system.\u00a0 By that time the three main areas of constitutional law, administrative law, and economic activities were covered by the royal decrees using an elaborate legal terminology, which is then appropriated by the specialists for divination. A major aspect of our inquiry will be investigating the notion of kittu , which is generally translated as \u2018truth,\u2019 and \u2018 d\u012bnu \u2018case, trial\u2019 and how they link law to divination and beyond, to the larger world view.    The compelling feature about Mesopotamian divination is not only its direct link with legislation as expressed in the use of judicial language but also with the cuneiform writing system. The cognitive process of transforming pathological forms observed on the liver into signs with cultural meaning which then are interpreted within a complex semiotic system show a similar cognitive process as the creation of writing. Both cultural systems, writing and divination, are dominated by the impact of the notion of drawing and writing to outline recognizable patterns, which can be traced back to representational prototypes. The question of representational prototypes then will lead us to understand cultural key metaphors of Mesopotamian religion.    Specialists for early writing (Gonzalo Rubio), law (Norman Yoffee), and cognitive sciences (Rita Watson) will lead some of the sessions and provide their expertise and insight to these questions.    Requirements: The research seminar is open to graduate students, visiting scholars, and faculty. Permission of the professor is required. Any primary sources will be provided with translations. Students are required to do short response papers to the readings and a presentation in combination with a written final paper. \u00a0    Cultural Interactions in Eurasian Art &amp; Archaeology Soeren Stark/Lillian Tseng Wednesdays 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. lillian.tseng@nyu.edu , soeren.stark@nyu.edu ISAW-GA 3015.001    Cross-cultural inquiries over the Eurasian continent are still, to a considerable degree, hampered both by the fragmenting character of traditional academic divisions (such as Near Eastern, Central Asian, East Asian, South Asian studies) and considerable language barriers. Whereas the current academic divisions encourage the in-depth investigation of issues derived from the \u2018core areas\u2019, it does not facilitate the cross-border inquiry that addresses the interconnectedness between assumed \u2018core areas\u2019.    This seminar is intended to bridge academic gaps by exploring a wealth of cultural interactions between Central Asia and East Asia through a series of representative cases dated from the fifth century BCE to the ninth century CE. In the class we will revisit the so-called \u201cScythian animal style\u201d that embodied the art of the steppe stretching from Ukraine to Northern China. We will compare how the Han Chinese perceived the Northern \u2018barbarians\u2019 and how the Xiongnu elites expressed their cultural identity themselves by commissioning and consuming prestigious art objects. We will have a closer look at how Soghdian funerary practices and the related visual arts persisted or were subsequently altered in their trading colonies in Northern China. The class will tackle material culture of Tang China, its shaping and its impact on the T\u00fcrk Qaghanats in the northwest and on Japan in the east. Finally, we will also consider the religious factor in cultural interaction by examining Buddhist grottos in B\u0101miy\u0101n and Dunhuang.    Permission of the professor is required. Reading knowledge of German or French is recommended, but alternate English readings are available if necessary. \u00a0    Fall 2011 Seminars \u00a0    Archaeology and Historiography: Perspectives on Time, Space, Text and Material Roderick B. Campbell Mondays: 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. roderickbcampbell@gmail.com    Though treated as separate disciplines and usually housed in different departments, at the highest level history and archaeology share the common goal of understanding the human past. Nevertheless, in both theory and method, not only are archaeology and history internally diverse, but also frequently miles apart.    This seminar will embark on an interdisciplinary exploration of the historical sciences: their histories, philosophies and methodologies. Special focus will be on theories of time (change, tradition, process, event, etc.), space (physical space, place, landscape, etc.), text (context, genre, discourse, memory, etc.) and material (material culture, materiality, things, actor-networks, etc.)    The reading load in this course will be heavy. Permission of the instructor is required.    Scientific practices and practitioners in Greco-Roman society Alexander Jones Wednesdays: 1:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. alexander.jones@nyu.edu    This seminar will explore the contexts and conditions in which scientific research, practice, writing, and teaching were conducted in the Greco-Roman world from c. 500 BCE to c. 600 CE. While a broad and comprehensive conception of science cannot be applied to Classical antiquity, intellectual traditions involving a systematic approach to the description, explanation, and prediction of phenomena and the prescription of actions were interrelated in various ways, for example by sharing methods and theoretical frameworks, by having some of the same people as practitioners, or by serving analogous social functions. The principal focuses of the seminar will be the richly documented conditions of activity of physicians and medical theorists from the Hippocratic to the Imperial periods, and the more fragmentary and challenging evidence pertaining to mathematicians, astronomers, and astrologers. Students must have proficiency in ancient Greek, and reading knowledge of at least one of French, German, and Latin. Permission of the instructor required.    The Archaeology of the Egyptian Oases Roger Bagnall Thursdays: 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. roger.bagnall@nyu.edu    This seminar will center on the ISAW-sponsored excavations in the Dakhla Oasis in the western desert of Upper Egypt, including the ongoing excavations of Amheida and the excavations carried out in 2006-2008 at the smaller site of Ain el-Gedida. Most of the material excavated at these sites to date has belonged to the third and fourth centuries CE, but at Amheida occupation goes back to the Old Kingdom or earlier, and there are substantial remains of the pharaonic periods of the first millennium BCE. There will be a specific focus on the relationship of archaeological contexts and the objects found in them, particularly but not only objects bearing writing. Special attention will be paid to the problems of insecure contexts and the interpretation of finds coming from such contexts.    There will be reading in French, German, and Italian. Students must have proficiency in at least one language, preferably two. Permission of the instructor required.     Divinatory Texts in Ancient Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays: 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. bpl2@nyu.edu    This course is intended to provide an insight into omen literature of Mesopotamia. It includes a mix of scientific and literary texts that in their formal structure derive from omen literature. We will read through an array of primary sources including Old Babylonian liver models, Old Babylonian extispicy omina and Neo-Assyrian omina containing historical allusionas, a Neo-Assyrian tam\u012btu -text as well as excerpts from the celestial omen series Enuma Anu Enlil . The reading of literary predictive texts from the Neo-Assyrian and Hellenistic periods - Prophecy A and the Uruk Prophecy - will illuminate the dependency of historiographic prophecies on astrological omina.    Students must have had at least one year of Akkadian. Permission of the instructor required.    Spring 2011 Seminars \u00a0    Chronology, Calendars, and Astronomy Alexander Jones Fridays: 9:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. alexander.jones@nyu.edu    A selection of recent and current research on astronomy and practices of short-term and long-term time reckoning in ancient Old World civilizations, with particular focus on ancient Near Eastern, Greco-Roman, and related traditions.    Permission of the professor is required.       Shaping the Divine in the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.    In this seminar we will explore the nature of the divine in the ancient Near East. Concepts of the divine are based on the concept of the person, which, in Antiquity, differs from the modern notion of individual personhood. The individual was conceived as embedded in the community of the family and the tribe or city at large. Rather than as an individual, the person was seen as a type assuming a variety of roles and functions. Ancient notions of the body and the person play very much into the conceptualization of the divine. What is more, ancient Near Eastern religions conceive of the divine as a relative category, which beyond anthropomorphic deities can be extended to living rulers, dead rulers, ancestors, demons, cultic objects, statutes, and celestial bodies. This fluid notion of the divine allows for a continuous re-conceptualization and reconfiguration of the polytheistic systems and monotheism. What is more it provides an insight into the various ways of social bonding of human kind with the divine. Methodological approaches to ethology, anthropology and cognitive sciences will help us to understand the ancient notion of divinity.    Permission of the professor is required.          Archaeology of Consumption in the Ancient Near East Caroline Sauvage Wednesdays 10:00 a.m - 1:00 p.m    Belongings define our world, and somehow define the individuals possessing them. From the early Neolithic to the modern day, humans have produced objects. Production first sustained basic needs but then also catered to aesthetics by creating pleasing objects such as jewelry or wall paintings. Consumer goods were charged with cultural meaning: they contributed to individual self-definition and collective identity. They were used to express gender, project cultural ideals, respond to social changes, and express status and rank in local and international environments. Therefore, symbol and intrinsic value of goods, ideas and images shaped consumption: for instance, the notion of prestige was closely associated to rare, restricted or exotic goods. Desire for foreign material increased exchange of raw materials and finished products. Imitations of exotic objects contributed to a wider diffusion and trickle-down of restricted products. Different societies did not interpret objects and images the same way: sometimes imported products were used \u201cincorrectly\u201d, their materiality being more important than their effective function. This reveals an intricate interaction between product and audience.    This course will explore the relationships between cultures, identities and consumption of goods, ideas and images in Ancient Near Eastern contexts. Class discussions will build upon (1) theoretical readings, and (2) student presentations concerning specific examples of consumption in the Ancient Near East. In-class discussions will evaluate the relevance of theories as compared to actual data, the reasons for their discrepancies or accordance.    Permission of the professor is required.          Territorial Fortifications in the Old World Soeren Stark Thursdays 2:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.    The seminar aims at a broad cross-cultural survey of the phenomenon of territorial fortifications in the Old world from Britain up to Northern China, from the late 3rd Millennium BC up to the pre-Mongol Middle Ages in the beginning of the 13th century AD. However, the focus will be laid on the various territorial fortifications in Eastern Iran and Western Central Asia and on questions regarding possible functions of these fortifications. In particular, the course will deal with the concept of pre-modern \"frontiers\" and its various social, economic and political aspects.    Course assignments are a presentation of one specific topic (30%) together with a research paper of 20-25 pages (50%) and participation in discussions (20%). A reading knowledge of English is required. The session in week 5 will also deal substantially with literature in German, the session in week 9 and 10 with literature in Russian.    Permission of the professor is required.    Fall 2010 Seminars    Ancient Texts and Documents: Editing a didactic manuscript from Roman Egypt Roger Bagnall and Alexander Jones Tuesdays 2:00-5:00pm    The focus of this seminar will be an unpublished Greek papyrus codex (comprising 13 leaves) from the fourth century of our era containing geometrical and arithmetical problems and model contracts. The manuscript will be studied through high resolution digital images. Our principal object, occupying part of each seminar meeting, will be to constitute a critical text and commentary; thus participants will have in depth exposure to important aspects of paleography, papyrology, codicology, and current research in pedagogy, science, and adminstration in late antiquity. The study of the codex as artifact and text will also serve as a foundation for research presentations that may extend into a broader social and intellectual context.    The editorial portion of each seminar meeting will take up one leaf of the codex, following their presumed order, with time reserved for revising the preceding session's work. Each editorial session will include establishment of the text, translation, and construction of a provisional commentary. Assignment of research presentations and papers will be settled at the beginning of the course according to the interests and competences of the individual participants. Presenters will provide readings and specialized bibliography in advance of their sessions.    Knowledge of ancient Greek is required for this seminar. Permission of the professor(s) required.    Central Asia and the Mediterranean from the 6th c.BC to the 8th c. AD Soeren Stark Thursdays 2:00-5:00pm    The course will inquire into the relations between the Mediterranean and the various steppe and oasis cultures in Central Asia from the Achaemenid period up to the early Middle Ages. These relations are characterized by a broad spectrum of different forms of contact and exchange. Direct contacts were established, for example, by military campaigns, diplomatic exchanges, migrations or colonization. Less direct ways of cultureal intermediation resulted from complex transcontinental trade flows. The course will focus on the consquencess which different forms of communication with the Mediterranean had on Central Asian art and material culture. In doing so topics like urbanism, sacral architecture and religious iconographies, but also aspects of material culture (ceramics, arms, costume) will have to be discussed.    A reading knowledge of two of the languages (French, German, Russian) is required. Permission of the professor is required.    History, Memory, and Media in China Lillian Tseng Wednesdays 3:00-6:00 pm    The seminar explores how art objects shape memory and intervene in history in China. It first focuses on bronze vessels and stone steles, investigating how media, intention, and reception influence the operation of commemorative art. It then tackles calligraphy and painting, discussing how the fusion of personal memory and collective memory transforms the tangle of the past and the present.    Prominent cases to be studied include the Simuwu bronze vessel cast in the Shang (c. 1600\u2013c.1050 BCE), the bronze basin inscribed by Qiang in the Western Zhou (c. 1050\u2013771 BCE), the stone steles erected by the First Emperor of the Qin (r. 221\u2013210 BCE), and the Preface to Collected Poems from the Orchid Pavilion written by Wang Xizhi (303\u2013361 CE). Discussions extend to the reception of antiquity in the Song (960\u20131279) and the Qing (1644\u20131911) periods. Comparable western theories and examples will also be examined.    Knowledge of Chinese is not required. Permission of the professor is required.    Spring 2010 Seminars \u00a0    Archaeology and Texts: Complementary, Redundant, and Contradictory Roger Bagnall and Holly Pittman Thursdays 10:00am-12:00pm    This seminar will address the issues involved in using multiple kinds of evidence for the investigation of problems in the study of the ancient world. It is organized around case studies that each participant will contribute to the discussion. The first half of the seminar will discuss such topics as the value of myth in third millennium Mesopotamia in interpreting the contemporary archaeological record and the reconstruction of imperial structure through the analysis of textual and visual lists. Participants will be expected to present topics of problems of archaeology and text within their own fields of interest.    The Exact Sciences in Antiquity Alexander Jones Wednesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    Topic: Mathematics and Astronomy in Mesopotamia We will examine the reading, interpretation, and contextualization of mathematical cuneiform texts, especially of the Late Babylonian and Seleucid periods, and astronomical texts of the first millennium B.C., with particular emphasis on recently published texts and research.    Globalization of Knowledge in the Multilingual and Multi-ethnic Milieu of the Ancient Near East II Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    See description for first half of course, above.       Fall 2009 Seminars \u00a0    Globalization of Knowledge in the Multilingual and Multi-ethnic Milieu of the Ancient Near East Beate Pongratz-Leisten Tuesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    Cuneiform culture, originally invented in Sumer, dominated the entire region of the ancient Near East despite local, political, and cultural differences and despite the fact that in many cultures Sumerian or Akkadian did not represent the spoken language. Throughout three thousand years of history, the body of educational and scholarly texts remained more or less uniform. The professionalism reflected in the textual corpora speaks in favor of a virtual community of intellectuals. Scribes and scholars viewed themselves as an established community of users of a shared traditional knowledge which was acquired by means of a common curriculum. Owing to their control of information and knowledge these scholars played an essential role among the elites of society. The same is true for craftsmen who, in antiquity, showed great mobility, and who, because of their skills, were among the first to be deported during times of war.\u00a0 The seminar will explore the nature of knowledge as transmitted in the cuneiform tradition, the relationship between science and religion, the carriers of knowledge, i.e. the communities of scholars and scribes; libraries and the findspots of the scholarly material and what these tell us about scribal practices, training, and competences in regions that were distant from Mesopotamia. These investigations will serve to detect the human agency behind the texts and material culture and the relationship between texts, objects and persons. The goal is to obtain a better grasp of the cultural mechanisms and strategies of the spread of knowledge in antiquity.    The Exact Sciences in Antiquity Alexander Jones Wednesdays, 2:00-4:00pm    Topic: Greco-Roman astrology The seminar will be devoted to several aspects of the history of Greco-Roman astrology, including: (1) the evidence for its date and place of origin, (2) the practice of astrology from the Hellenistic period to late antiquity as reflected in papyri, artifacts, and medievally transmitted texts, and (3) Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos (or Apotelesmatika) and the ancient tradition of commentaries on that work.

                                             The Ancient World multidisciplinary concentration focuses on the shared and overlapping periods in the development of cultures and civilizations around the Mediterranean basin, in the Near East, and across central Asia to the Pacific Ocean.   Abu Dhabi's location at the center of this geographical expanse makes it an ideal site for exploring the intellectual and material riches of the ancient world. This concentration encompasses a number of disciplines, including archaeology, art history, history, literature, and philosophy. In addition to regular coursework, students may also have the opportunity to participate in an archaeological excavation.                             Requirements   Four courses, distributed across at least two disciplines and/or civilizations.     Students who elect this Multidisciplinary Concentration select four courses approved by their mentor. Students are also encouraged to take a course in archaeology or material culture. NYU operates several archaeological excavations, including in the Dakhla Oasis of Egypt and in Aphrodisias, in Turkey. This fieldwork requires special training, and admission is by application. Other archaeological fieldwork opportunities are available in the UAE and the region. Students can learn more about fieldwork opportunities by consulting with the Ancient World faculty.

We study the earliest human inventions such as spears and simple tools; ponder the methods that might have been used in the construction of monolithic structures such as Stone Henge, Egyptian obelisks, and pyramids; and explore examples of technological innovations that affected the course of human history. Throughout the course, the emphasis is on developing personal approaches to creativity and innovation by studying specific examples of these attributes from the ancient world.

Through their work, we will grapple with a range of pressing philosophical questions, including: Is happiness more than a subjective state of consciousness? Is death harmful? Do we have free will? Do we have obligations to others that override the pursuit of our own self-interest? What is the relation between the mind (or the soul) and the body? Since most of the philosophers we will be studying thought that philosophy must be systematic in its approach, we will also try to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this kind of approach to philosophical questions.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day.

periods in the development of cultures and civilizations around the Mediterranean basin, in the Near East, and across central Asia to the Pacific Ocean.   Abu Dhabi's location at the center of this geographical expanse makes it an ideal site for exploring the intellectual and material riches of the ancient world. This concentration encompasses a number of disciplines, including archaeology, art history, history, literature, and philosophy. In addition to regular coursework, students may also have the opportunity to participate in an archaeological excavation.                             Requirements   Four courses, distributed across at least two disciplines and/or civilizations.     Students who elect this Multidisciplinary Concentration select four courses approved by their mentor. Students are also encouraged to take a course in archaeology or material culture. NYU operates several archaeological excavations, including in the Dakhla Oasis of Egypt and in Aphrodisias, in Turkey. This fieldwork requires special training, and admission is by application. Other archaeological fieldwork opportunities are available in the UAE and the region.

We study the earliest human inventions such as spears and simple tools; ponder the methods that might have been used in the construction of monolithic structures such as Stone Henge, Egyptian obelisks, and pyramids; and explore examples of technological innovations that affected the course of human history. Throughout the course, the emphasis is on developing personal approaches to creativity and innovation by studying specific examples of these attributes from the ancient world.

Through their work, we will grapple with a range of pressing philosophical questions, including: Is happiness more than a subjective state of consciousness? Is death harmful? Do we have free will? Do we have obligations to others that override the pursuit of our own self-interest? What is the relation between the mind (or the soul) and the body? Since most of the philosophers we will be studying thought that philosophy must be systematic in its approach, we will also try to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this kind of approach to philosophical questions.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).
