The increase in international art transactions has incubated a booming market for stolen and fraudulent art, and major U.S. arts institutions still grapple with repatriation of stolen or looted objects in their collections. Co-organized by Jane C.H. Jacob , art historian and provenance research expert, Jacob Fine Art, Inc., Chris Marinello, director and founder, Art Recovery Group, and Alice Farren-Bradley, Museum Security Network, the symposium brings together experts from major museums and auction houses, the NYU School of Law, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the President\u2019s Cultural Property Advisory Committee, as well as independent scholars and authors, art crime victims, art crime attorneys, forensic scientists, and other major players working to address art crime worldwide.   Join us and learn about the legal, forensic, governmental, and political strategies being employed to address the enormity of this global phenomenon. Topics include the history of fakes and forgeries, insurance fraud, art theft and art scams, scientific and forensic approaches, provenance research, cultural repatriation, issues facing auction houses and purchasers, and current case studies.         CLE units and financial aid are available for those who qualify. Attorneys attending the symposium can earn 8 CLEs in Professional Practice: 3.5 CLEs (June 4), 2.5 CLEs (June 5), and 2.0 CLEs (June 6). CLEs are transitional.
