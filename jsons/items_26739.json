It emphasizes integrated, problem-oriented study and a broad range of courses across disciplines and schools.    Biology  The Biology department offers students the opportunity to explore the various areas of current biology in an integrated yet diverse program that builds from a solid foundation of the basic elements of molecular and cellular biology, genetics, evolution, organ systems, and population studies. The department also offers a series of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and environmental biology.    Animal Studies Initiative  The Animal Studies Initiative promotes and supports research and teaching in the emerging area of Animal Studies. It does so by administering an undergraduate minor in Animal Studies, supporting research and teaching, and sponsoring public events and workshops.    Graduate   Bioethics   The program promotes a broad conception of bioethics encompassing both medical and environmental ethics through conferences, workshops, public lectures, and graduate courses.    Center on Environmental and Land Use Law (NYU School of Law)  This center emphasizes legal research and problem-solving in three principal subject areas: Environmental Regulation, International Environmental Law and Sustainable Development, and Land Use Law and Regulation.    Environmental Conservation Education (NYU Steinhardt)   An intensive interdisciplinary MA program that involves students in a consideration of social, philosophical, political, and educational perspectives on the environment. The ECE program is the oldest graduate program in environmental studies in the U.S. with a foundation in environmental philosophy rather than science.   Master of Urban Planning (NYU Wagner)   This program not only provides students with an understanding of the economic, technological and social forces that shape metropolitan areas at home and abroad, it also equips them with the tools needed to confront the key challenges facing urban communities across the globe.    Certificate in Sustainable Design, Construction, and Development (SCPS Schack Institute of Real Estate)  This certificate program was created to clear a career path for those interested in equipping themselves to serve a vital public purpose and master an invaluable field of knowledge for future real estate practice.    CUSP (Center for Urban Science and Progress)  The Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) is a unique public-private research center that uses New York City as its laboratory and classroom to help cities around the world become more productive, livable, equitable, and resilient. CUSP observes, analyzes, and models cities to optimize outcomes, prototype new solutions, formalize new tools and processes, and develop new expertise/experts. These activities will make CUSP the world's leading authority in the emerging field of \"Urban Informatics.\"     Other programs with elective courses that focus on environmental issues:    Individualized Concentrations (NYU Gallatin)   Though Gallatin does not offer a degree with an explicit environmental focus, its interdisciplinary, individualized undergraduate and graduate degree programs have often lent themselves to environmental study. Students have access to courses across several different NYU schools, and many choose to develop sustainability-related concentrations by combining resources throughout the university. Gallatin itself also offers several environment-focused courses.    Interactive Telecommunications Program (NYU Tisch)   ITP challenges students to apply their creativity and imagination to the latest digital tools and techniques and push the boundaries of interactivity in the real and digital worlds.

Selected instructors will lead about 10 students in a collaborative semester-long project culminating in a public presentation and written report. Description Capstone seminars are problem-based, project-oriented courses for senior Environmental Studies students. They require self-initiated, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and integrative student work. The capstone entails students working for a client (actual or hypothetical) and using an applied approach to problem solving. Students work collaboratively on a current environmental problem, including characterizing the problem, analyzing possible solutions, implementing solutions, and publicly presenting the results.The aim is to improve a student\u2019s ability to synthesize and integrate material from a range of disciplines while deploying diverse methodologies and vocabularies in a problem-solving context. The capstone relates theoretical knowledge and skills to practical problems, while students work collaboratively in real world situations to research and communicate results to a variety of audiences.Each capstone works as a single team under the leadership of an instructor. Capstones meet weekly. Much of the work will be done outside of class in interviewing stakeholders, analyzing data and visiting sites. Experts may be brought in to brief the seminar on particular aspects of the problem under discussion. At the end of the term, projects are presented to the client, students, NYU faculty, and interested members of the community. Visit http://www.environment.as.nyu.edu/page/capstone for descriptions and videos of past capstones. Application Materials To apply, please submit the following to environmental.studies@nyu.edu by 3/26/2015 at noon. Interviews will be scheduled shortly thereafter. Project title Project description Intended client (actual or hypothetical) Outcomes Class activities Statement of interest Resume or CV Preference on whether you would like to teach in Fall 2015 or Spring 2016 Please contact the program at environmental.studies@nyu.edu if you have any questions before submitting a proposal. Instructors will be compensated as adjunct instructors and have access to a course support budget and NYU resources.

Selected instructors will lead about 10 students in a collaborative semester-long project culminating in a public presentation and written report. Description Capstone seminars are problem-based, project-oriented courses for senior Environmental Studies students. They require self-initiated, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and integrative student work. The capstone entails students working for a client (actual or hypothetical) and using an applied approach to problem solving. Students work collaboratively on a current environmental problem, including characterizing the problem, analyzing possible solutions, implementing solutions, and publicly presenting the results.The aim is to improve a student\u2019s ability to synthesize and integrate material from a range of disciplines while deploying diverse methodologies and vocabularies in a problem-solving context. The capstone relates theoretical knowledge and skills to practical problems, while students work collaboratively in real world situations to research and communicate results to a variety of audiences.Each capstone works as a single team under the leadership of an instructor. Capstones meet weekly. Much of the work will be done outside of class in interviewing stakeholders, analyzing data and visiting sites. Experts may be brought in to brief the seminar on particular aspects of the problem under discussion. At the end of the term, projects are presented to the client, students, NYU faculty, and interested members of the community. Visit http://www.environment.as.nyu.edu/page/capstone for descriptions and videos of past capstones. Application Materials To apply, please submit the following to environmental.studies@nyu.edu by 3/26/2015 at noon. Interviews will be scheduled shortly thereafter.
