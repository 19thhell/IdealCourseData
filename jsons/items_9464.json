Virtually all your college courses require you to write papers or reports, but courses offered by the Expository Writing Program are opportunities to concentrate intensely on the process of writing. The Expository Writing Program assumes that writing is not merely a useful skill but also a way of learning and knowing. Its courses focus on the examination of evidence, the development of ideas, and the clear expression of those ideas in a variety of different kinds of essays. In these writing courses, students routinely move from exploration to argument as they read and make use of various texts\u2014written, visual, experiential\u2014to create a spectrum of persuasive essays. Examined texts become more complex, and the writing tasks more difficult, as students grapple with intriguing questions that lead to richer ideas and more interesting forms of expression. The essays students write become more formal and argumentative as the semester\u2019s work progresses. Additional information, requirements and course descriptions appear on the Expository Writing Program website.     Foreign Language The study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as government, business, and research. NYU is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its rapidly expanding opportunities for study abroad. To fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum, students must show or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence (see list of courses below). Some languages are also taught in intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages are encouraged to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Students of all languages, ancient or modern, are encouraged to continue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. Exemptions: Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum by presenting outstanding scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test in a foreign language, or by passing a departmental proficiency examination. For further information on language placement and exemption, and for Advanced Placement Test equivalencies, consult your advisor or the College of Arts and Science Bulletin (available online from the CAS website). Students whose secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than a language offered in the College, or who complete the International Writing Workshop sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, International Writing Workshop I; and EXPOS-UA 9, International Writing Workshop II), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the B.S./B.E. program. In addition to the foreign languages courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportunities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, non-credit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, contact the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909.\u2028    Foreign Language Courses Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study.

For more information on specific language classes, placement, or exemption, please contact the language coordinator, director of language programs, or director of undergraduate studies named in the individual departmental listings. Thanks to an exchange arrangement with Columbia University, students may also enroll in the following languages, offered through the intermediate level and given at Columbia: Armenian, Bengali, Catalan, Czech (Elementary I and II are offered in the College; intermediate-level courses are offered at Columbia), Dutch, Finnish, Georgian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Kannada, Polish, Punjabi, Romanian, Sanskrit, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Modern Tibetan, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof, and Zulu. For information about these courses, visit the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908 or click here for more information.    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture is the arts, humanities, and social sciences component of the College Core Curriculum. Within each of its components, students are free to pursue their interests through their choice of classes. The structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information below, to learn more about FCC courses, we strongly recommend that you browse past and present syllabuses. Texts and Ideas Texts and Ideas is the name for a diverse group of humanities courses that study challenging, influential texts about big ideas: freedom, the nature of the soul, the place of humans in the natural and animal world, beauty, citizenship, morality, the imagination, the use of the past, and many more. Some courses explore a single theme or a set of closely related ideas; others investigate the relationship between two periods of intellectual history, for example, selected writings in the philosophy and literature of ancient Greece and Rome and their reception in a later era. Texts and Ideas courses also seek to refine students\u2019 ability to write and speak about complex concepts and arguments with clarity, originality, and eloquence. You will be challenged not only to master the content of some of the world\u2019s most influential philosophical texts and works of literature, but to discuss how the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropriated, or rejected over time. Cultures and Contexts Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways humans see themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional groups. Individual courses focus on political, social, or cultural collectives that are distinct from the dominant traditions of contemporary North America, such as central Asia, Russia, Korea, or ancient Egypt; some courses study diaspora formations and emergent traditions. Primary texts are central to every course, with some faculty concentrating on historical documents, others on art, film, or literary texts. Cultures and Contexts courses share a common aim to examine the ways cultures emerge and interact through trade, colonization, immigration, religious proselytization, and representation in various media; how groups define themselves through beliefs, values, and customs; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects comprehension of the ways in which premodern or non-Western peoples experience and imagine their lives.  Societies and the Social Sciences We live in a world molded by massive social, political, and economic transformations, and to be thoughtful, responsible citizens we need to understand them. From the nineteenth century to today, drawing on earlier movements, thinkers have developed new methods for understanding the complexity of these phenomena by studying societal structures and human behavior. Societies and the Social Sciences is our name for a set of courses offered by social science departments across the Faculty of Arts and Science\u2014Anthropology, Social and Cultural Analysis, Economics, Politics, History, Linguistics, Psychology, Religious Studies, and Sociology. Students fulfill the requirement by taking one of a list of designated courses or by majoring or minoring in the social sciences. Expressive Culture Art arouses pleasure, wonder, confusion, curiosity, and many other things. How is art made, and for what purpose? How do artworks convey meaning or feelings? How does social context shape the making of art? In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression by focusing on one of five media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social and political life. Our teaching is fueled by our passion for fostering life-long appreciation of the arts, and New York City is the ideal place to experience them in all their variety. Whenever possible, faculty draw on the rich cultural resources of the city around us.    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is the mathematics and natural science component of the College Core Curriculum. Rather than providing a routine coverage of facts, FSI courses stress the process and applications of quantitative and scientific thinking. The design of these courses is based on the conviction that science is interesting, accessible, and important for all undergraduates. FSI courses encourage students to approach science as a way of knowing, a quest to understand who we are and our place in the universe. They also provide you with a foundation to make informed decisions\u2014both personal and societal\u2014as citizens of a world that is increasingly influenced by science and technology. No matter what career path you choose, the study of science will enrich your critical thinking skills and expand your appreciation of the natural world. Quantitative Reasoning Mathematics is both a curiosity-driven endeavor and a powerful analytical tool. Mathematics strives to deduce universal rules that govern numbers, geometry, and logic. When applied to the analysis of data, mathematics allows us to derive conclusions, for example, about the likelihood of random events or the effectiveness of medical therapies. In today\u2019s data-driven world we are constantly bombarded with numbers, from projections of the national debt to the likelihood of catching the flu, so citizens of the 21st century need an ability to critically evaluate numerical information. The Core\u2019s Quantitative Reasoning courses provide you with the mathematical foundations and analytical skills to investigate, evaluate, and draw conclusions from numerical evidence. Natural Science I Natural Science I describes a range of courses that examine the foundations of the physical sciences\u2014physics and chemistry. At its core, the physical sciences seek to understand the role of matter and energy in explaining a broad range of phenomena, such as the large scale structure of the universe and the factors that affect the earth\u2019s climate. These investigations require the application of mathematical tools to quantify and predict our complex world. Natural Science I courses examine questions at the cutting edge of scientific investigation: What fundamental insights do scientists hope to gain from the Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most complex scientific experiment ever performed? Why have astronomers propose the unseen existence of dark matter and dark energy? What do investigations into the Earth\u2019s historical climate reveal about the scope of global climate change in the 20th and 21st centuries? Do renewable energy sources provide a feasible global alternative to fossil fuels? Natural Science II Natural Science II encapsulates a variety of courses that examine the broad diversity of life sciences\u2014biology, neuroscience, and physical anthropology. We are currently witnessing an explosion of information in the life sciences, stimulated by the development of new tools such as DNA technologies, computer databases, and brain scanners. These new insights have thrust science into the forefront of social, ethical, and legal debates on such topics as stem cell research, the evidence for evolution, the preservation of biodiversity, and the neurological basis of decision making. Each Natural Science II course uses a thematic approach to introduce students to the foundations and frontiers of scientific investigation in the life sciences.

You may then forward the permission email to marc.leblanc@nyu.edu to get the registration access code.    All classes are held in the 2nd floor seminar room unless indicated otherwise.  Fall 2015 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3002-001 Observation and Experiment in Ancient Physical Science Alexander Jones alexander.jones@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar explores the empirical elements in ancient scientific traditions that aimed at systematic description, explanation, or prediction of physical phenomena. Scientific practices of the Ancient Near East and the Greco-Roman world will figure prominently, but those of other civilizations may be investigated according to the interests and competences of participants. The evidence is largely textual; knowledge of at least one ancient language in which relevant scientific texts exist is required. Participants will choose topics, select study materials, and guide discussion for at least one session.    An initial selection of topics will include the following: the rise of systematic observation of spontaneously occurring phenomena in the context of interpretation of the phenomena as ominous signs; practices of recording and transmitting observations of astral, meteorological, and mundane events; precision, accuracy, and instruments of measurement, especially in astronomical observation records; experiment and experimental apparatus in Greek harmonic theory; empirical claims within deductive scientific texts, e.g. in optics, mechanics, and astronomy; empirical argument in Ptolemy's Optics; adjustment and fabrication of reported observations and measurements.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Greco-Arabic Translation Movement Robert Hoyland rgh2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    This course will explore the different paths along which knowledge of Antiquity passed into Muslim intellectual culture and how it was received and interpreted.\u00a0 The focus will not just be on the so-called \u2018translation movement\u2019, but also the broader question of how pre-Islamic histories and cultures fared in the Middle East after the Arab conquests.\u00a0 We will principally look at\u00a0Greek texts translated into Arabic, which receive the most scholarly attention, because they are regarded as crucial to understanding how classical learning was conveyed to Europe and because classicists are always hoping to find lost Greek works preserved in Arabic. However, we will also give consideration to\u00a0translation from Middle Persian and Sanskrit, which may well have been substantial, though the question has been too little studied to be sure.    \u00a0 Assessment will be via a final paper which should draw upon study of original Arabic texts (or a text) and should have a research dimension to it (i.e. not be just a survey of what is known).    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Arabic are required, and some familiarity with Greek would be an advantage.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 The Manuscripts of Early Chinese Natural Philosophy Ethan Harkness harkness@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course will introduce students to a variety of recently excavated Chinese technical manuscripts dating from the late Warring States, Qin, and Western Han periods (4th \u2013 1st centuries BCE).\u00a0 We will pay particular attention to the various calendrically-based divination texts promulgated in the manuscripts known as rishu (\u201cdaybooks\u201d), but the fields of astronomy, geography, medicine, and mathematics will all receive due consideration.\u00a0 When appropriate, reference will be made to connections with transmitted texts and to the later repercussions of ideas developed and refined in the years immediately surrounding the formation of the Chinese empire.\u00a0 Topics to consider will include the social function of the early technical texts; the nature of their transmission and evolution; regional idiosyncrasies; the interconnected roles of scribes and readers; and the possible function of both political ideology and private interests in shaping the texts.    Prerequisites are good reading knowledge of modern and classical Chinese and permission of the instructor.    ISAW-GA 3010-002 Advanced Study in Chinese Art &amp; Archaeology Lillian Tseng lillian.tseng@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course is intended to provide intensive analyses of primary sources and related scholarship in Chinese art &amp; archaeology for graduate students who have sufficient knowledge of the field. Topics to study depend on the research need of the students.    Ability to read Classical Chinese and permission of the instructor are required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Archaeology and Historiography: Perspectives on Time, Space, Text and Material Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Though treated as separate disciplines and usually housed in different departments, at the highest level history and archaeology share the common goal of understanding the human past. Nevertheless, in both theory and method, not only are archaeology and history internally diverse, but also frequently miles apart. This seminar will embark on an interdisciplinary exploration of the historical sciences: their histories, philosophies and methodologies. Special focus will be on theories of time (change, tradition, process, event, etc.), space (physical space, place, landscape, etc.), text (context, genre, discourse, memory, etc.) and material (material culture, materiality, things, actor-networks, etc.)    The reading load in this course will be heavy. Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3013-001 Production, Accumulation, Trade, and Value: Political Economy in the Ancient Mediterranean Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Elizabeth Murphy lda5@nyu.edu ; elizabeth.murphy@nyu.edu Mondays, 2:00-5:00pm    During the last decades, renewed attention has been devoted to the importance of market and private enterprise in the economies of the ancient Mediterranean, as exemplified by such works as A history of market performance: from ancient Babylonia to the modern world (van der Spek et al., eds., 2015), Commerce and colonization in the ancient Near East (Aubet, 2013), and The Roman market economy (Temin, 2013). On the one hand, interest in market and private enterprise enables us to traverse artificial distinctions between pre-classical and classical ancient Mediterranean civilizations and to pose cross-culturally comparative questions about ancient state economies. On the other hand, this new trend in some respects pays less attention to institutional and political impacts on ancient economies. This impact has perhaps received too much attention in the historiography of ancient western Asia, but the meaning of political intervention in the economic process acquires a different meaning when embedded in a context of private enterprises. For the Roman world, the interests of imperial institutions (e.g., military supply chains, annona redistributions, imperial monopolies) as influencing the scale and organization of economic activities has been long recognized, but recent approaches have turned to the more subtle and indirect ways that institutions affected regional economic development. In response to these academic trends, this course aims to examine the role of political economy in the ancient Mediterranean from multiple vantages.\u00a0 The first classes will focus on recent theoretical works on political economy such as Piketty\u2019s Capital , and North\u2019s Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance , as well as some of the \u2018classic\u2019 works on ancient economies, such as those by Polanyi, Finley, and Rostovtzeff. In the following classes, ideas developed through the theory classes will then be confronted with specific case studies from the protohistory of ancient western Asia and the Greco-Roman world. These thematic classes will consider issues of primary production, storage and hoarding (accumulation of surpluses and wealth), trade, and the definition of value.\u00a0    Permission of the instructors is required.    Fall 2015 Tutorials    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Texts from the Libraries of the Kingdom of Eshnunna Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm Large Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    Various cities of the kingdom of Eshnunna have yielded literary texts, among them the city of Eshnunna, which seems to have housed a center for scribal training already during the Old Akkadian period, where a forerunner to The Great Revolt Against Naram-Sin has come to light; the city of Tell Harmal, ancient Shaduppum, where the only copy of Sargon in Foreign Lands has been found; and the city of Tell Haddad, ancient Meturan, which yielded a remarkable collection of tablets from a private house owned by an exorcist. In addition to Akkadian archival texts found in separate rooms, there has come to light from two areas a library containing a fragment of the Laws of Eshnunna as well as numerous lexical, liturgical, literary and magic texts (incantations), two prayers to the sun god, and the earliest attested bilingual forerunner to the hemerological series Inbu bel arhi . Among the literary texts, perhaps the most unexpected discovery is a copy of the Sumerian version of the story of Adapa and two larger fragments of the Death of  Gilgamesh . Other Gilgamesh stories represented at Meturan are Gilgamesh and the Bull of An , Gilgamesh and Huwawa , and Gilgamesh, EnkIdu and the Netherworld .    The goal of this seminar is to examine Eshnunna\u2019s role in the transmission of scholarly knowledge through an in-depth analysis of the written compositions extant from the major cities of the kingdom.    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Akkadian and Sumerian are required.    ISAW-GA 3014-002 Advanced Akkadian: Old Babylonian Historical Texts Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 11:00am-1:00pm Small Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    This advanced course in Akkadian will emphasize the reading of Old Babylonian texts from the sites of Mari and Eshnunna in order to investigate the rise to power and political relations of these two kingdoms during the Old Babylonian period. Primary texts read will include the treaty concluded between between Zimri-lim of Mari and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna and a lengthy letter from Ibal-pi-el II to Zimri-lim offering a political alliance.\u00a0 These two texts offer insight into the form and structure as well as the terminology of international treaties during the first half of the second millennium BCE. Additional readings will include not only other historical inscriptions of the kings of Mari and of Eshnunna but also, for the purposes of comparison and contrast, inscriptions of the kings of Larsa.    Students will acquire an in-depth understanding of the variety and scope of historical and particularly royal inscriptions in the time of the competing territorial states of the Old Babylonian period.    Permission of the instructor and Intermediate Akkadian are required.    Fall 2015 Other Courses    ISAW-GA 1000-001 Intro to Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course, in the first part of a full year course over two semesters, introduces students to the Middle Egyptian (Classical) dialect of the Ancient Egyptian language in its hieroglyphic form. The classes are structured primarily according to the lessons in J.P. Allen, Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of the Hieroglyphs . The course will usually proceed at the rate of one chapter per week, but occasionally a chapter may be skipped or two chapters will be combined. The goal of the first semester is to reach the treatment of the Egyptian verb and the infinitive in Allen\u2019s 13th and 14th chapters. The lessons will be supplemented with readings from A.H. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar , 3rd. edition, M. Collier and B. Manley, How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs , revised edition, and occasional excerpts from Egyptian funerary stelae.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 1002-001 Advanced Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course is based on readings from actual Egyptian hieroglyphic texts in their original form. In the early stages of the course, the readings will be presented in both a \u201cnormalized\u201d form with the individual sentences and clauses demarked as well as in the original, continuous text format. The readings will be drawn from a wide range of genres and will increase in difficulty as the course progresses. Where appropriate, photographs and line drawings will be used so that students will learn to handle hieroglyphic text as it actually appears on Egyptian objects. The readings are drawn from a text book in progress.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Spring 2016 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Roman Law and the Papyri Roger Bagnall roger.bagnall@nyu.edu Thursdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Ever since the first legal documents on papyrus dating to the Roman imperial period were published in the nineteenth century, it has been evident to jurists that the papyri offered a unique opportunity to look in depth at how the majestic and complex structure of Roman law that we know from the classical jurists (largely excerpted in Justinian\u2019s Digest) worked on the ground in the provinces. A sizable literature on the subject developed in the early twentieth centuy and has continued to evolve. This seminar will take a series of key issues and institutions, including marriage, the legal status of women, slavery, testation, and major contract types. For each we will examine both selections from the jurists and some representative papyrus documents.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 Shang Civilization: Text and Material Culture Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar will focus on the Shang dynasty of ancient China from the perspective of archaeology, epigraphy and transmitted texts. The archaeology will cover north China in the 2nd millennium BCE, but focus on the site of Anyang where inscribed oracle-bones and bronzes, monumental tombs and palatial buildings were discovered in the early 20th century demonstrating the historicity of the Shang dynasty. The oracle-bones and bronze inscriptions of the Anyang period will present an opportunity to glimpse a partial image of Shang royal and high elite concerns, especially concerning ritual. A study of Shang history from the perspective of transmitted texts will give both an opportunity to understand the place of the Shang dynasty in later Chinese history as well as its formation as historical subject. This course will be taught at several levels and students of non-sinological background are welcome. While the ability to read classical and modern Chinese would be an asset, neither language is a requirement for this seminar.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Beyond China and Byzantium Robert Hoyland and S\u00f6ren Stark rgh2@nyu.edu ; \u00a0 soeren.stark@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Permission of the instructors is required.    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Cultural Memory and the Libraries in Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3023-001 Special Topics in Digital Humanities for the Ancient World: Computational Photography and 3D Modeling Sebastian Heath sh1933@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    The premise of this course is that virtual representations of the ancient world will become increasingly important to both research and teaching as the ability to create, work with, and share such digital resources becomes less expensive and more widely available. Accordingly, the course will combine hands-on experience with creating and using virtual representations of ancient material culture, including objects and architectural spaces, with a review of current practices being employed by projects around the world. Students will use such tools as the open-source 3d-suite Blender, the game engine Unity, and applications for making models with smartphone cameras. We will explore techniques for making richly-textured 3d models of real objects as well as create immersive virtual environments. Readings will include reports of ongoing work as well as discussions of why 3D matters and how it is being used in the classroom. Guest speakers from academia and industry will provide a broad perspective on current trends. Students will use their own computers and should be willing to apply themselves to learning the digital skills the class introduces.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Spring 2016 Tutorials    ISAW-GA 3014-002 Advanced Akkadian: Neo-Babylonian Historical Inscriptions Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 11:00am-1:00pm Small Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    The Advanced Reading of Akkadian Class of Neo-Babylonian Inscriptions is designed to introduce into the Neo-Babylonian dialect and to familiarize the student with its particular paleography and grammar. Simultaneously, a diachronic choice of Neo-Babylonian inscriptions reaching from Nabupolassar, its founder, to Nabonidus will provide an insight into the history of the Neo-Babylonian empire.    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Akkadian are required.    Spring 2016 Other Courses    ISAW-GA 1001-001 Intro to Ancient Egyptian II Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD  This course is a continuation of the first semester. The course will proceed at the rate of a chapter per week through J.P. Allen, Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of the Hieroglyphs . From time to time, passages from actual Egyptian texts will supplement the examples in Allen\u2019s grammar. Depending on the progress of the class, the last weeks of the course will cover the hieroglyphic transcription of The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor , an actual Egyptian literary tale.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 1003-001 Advanced Ancient Egyptian II Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This is a continuation of the fall semester course, using additional sources of increasing difficulty.
