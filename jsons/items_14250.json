These are \"sample course outlines\" and should not be used as the basis for buying textbooks or other course materials. The NYU bookstores will have the official list of materials that will be used next semester. As soon as the next semester outlines are available, they will be posted on the department web site under the Academic Programs tab, and cross-listed on the school-wide course list .
