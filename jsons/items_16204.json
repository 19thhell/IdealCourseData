It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

LEAD-AD 115J Critical Issues in Social Entrepreneurship: Innovations in the Middle East                                                                                         Social Entrepreneurship is a dynamic and growing field which may be defined in various ways, yet at its core is about using evolved business thinking and practices to change the world. This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

SRPP-AD 134J 21st-Century International Human Rights                                                                              This course is designed to give an introduction to the law, policy, philosophy, institutions, and practice of modern international human rights. Human rights have a history that is national, regional, and international. Part I of the course presents an overview of the theory, history, and legal frameworks of the international human rights movement. Part II will explore these themes through the lens of the Argentinian experience. Students will study human rights violations during the Dirty War and national and international responses that sought to expose abuses, marshal human rights institutions to take action against them. We also will examine efforts within Argentina over the last 30 years to balance reconciliation and accountability for past abuses. In Part III, we will examine current human rights challenges facing governments, civil society groups, international organizations, and businesses today. The course will include field trips around Buenos Aires and guest speakers with direct experience in the human rights movement in Argentina.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

Human rights have a history that is national, regional, and international. Part I of the course presents an overview of the theory, history, and legal frameworks of the international human rights movement. Part II will explore these themes through the lens of the Argentinian experience. Students will study human rights violations during the Dirty War and national and international responses that sought to expose abuses, marshal human rights institutions to take action against them. We also will examine efforts within Argentina over the last 30 years to balance reconciliation and accountability for past abuses. In Part III, we will examine current human rights challenges facing governments, civil society groups, international organizations, and businesses today. The course will include field trips around Buenos Aires and guest speakers with direct experience in the human rights movement in Argentina.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

arts     culturally because we live in an increasingly connected world     socially because of the need to develop socially responsible products and services       Classical education invites experts to work with a community to build infrastructure capacity over a short window of time. We believe in co-innovating with the communities over an extended period of time.   Several courses offered by IDEA Lab provide gleaning insights that would be otherwise impossible to access from literature review or survey of scholarly works. The field labs foster the development of knowledge of contemporary issues, allow students to thrive as part of a multi-disciplinary team, and broaden the horizons to understand the impact of modern solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.     The Superlab   Design &amp; Innovation course has yielded several patent applications and some startup companies are beginning to come out of the ideas generated at boot camp. The creation of companies with good income streams, providing goods and services to the local population is our definition of success.                                                          Entrepreneurship at Abu dhabi   The emergence of megacities can offer a wealth of opportunities for startup firms. The rural poor migrating to these megacities - a total of 1 billion people - will become the new middle class earning a salary of between $5 and $30 a day. No one is currently catering for these people who will need products and services for education, health, water, food and entertainment.   The economic engine previously dominated by big companies taking care of people's needs can also be met by a lot of smaller entrepreneurs living around the world. Middle East region is well placed to service the seven emerging growth economies - including China, India, Turkey, Russia and Indonesia \u2013 that by 2020 will contribute to 45 percent of global GDP. This is why teaching innovation in a place like Abu Dhabi is of particular importance.   We are reaching out to others in the country and in the region for their support. This includes the owners of successful family-run businesses - or their children who tend to be western educated and want to be involved in socially responsible projects. We are in touch with Two Four 54, the Abu Dhabi Media Zone Authority and other UAE government agencies.   There are entrepreneurially inclined people across the Middle East seeking a more politically stable place to live. They are risk oriented and can move to any place to make a living.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

LEAD-AD 115J Critical Issues in Social Entrepreneurship: Innovations in the Middle East                                                                                         Social Entrepreneurship is a dynamic and growing field which may be defined in various ways, yet at its core is about using evolved business thinking and practices to change the world. This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

SRPP-AD 134J 21st-Century International Human Rights                                                                              This course is designed to give an introduction to the law, policy, philosophy, institutions, and practice of modern international human rights. Human rights have a history that is national, regional, and international. Part I of the course presents an overview of the theory, history, and legal frameworks of the international human rights movement. Part II will explore these themes through the lens of the Argentinian experience. Students will study human rights violations during the Dirty War and national and international responses that sought to expose abuses, marshal human rights institutions to take action against them. We also will examine efforts within Argentina over the last 30 years to balance reconciliation and accountability for past abuses. In Part III, we will examine current human rights challenges facing governments, civil society groups, international organizations, and businesses today. The course will include field trips around Buenos Aires and guest speakers with direct experience in the human rights movement in Argentina.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

arts     culturally because we live in an increasingly connected world     socially because of the need to develop socially responsible products and services       Classical education invites experts to work with a community to build infrastructure capacity over a short window of time. We believe in co-innovating with the communities over an extended period of time.   Several courses offered by IDEA Lab provide gleaning insights that would be otherwise impossible to access from literature review or survey of scholarly works. The field labs foster the development of knowledge of contemporary issues, allow students to thrive as part of a multi-disciplinary team, and broaden the horizons to understand the impact of modern solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.     The Superlab   Design &amp; Innovation course has yielded several patent applications and some startup companies are beginning to come out of the ideas generated at boot camp. The creation of companies with good income streams, providing goods and services to the local population is our definition of success.                                                          Entrepreneurship at Abu dhabi   The emergence of megacities can offer a wealth of opportunities for startup firms. The rural poor migrating to these megacities - a total of 1 billion people - will become the new middle class earning a salary of between $5 and $30 a day. No one is currently catering for these people who will need products and services for education, health, water, food and entertainment.   The economic engine previously dominated by big companies taking care of people's needs can also be met by a lot of smaller entrepreneurs living around the world. Middle East region is well placed to service the seven emerging growth economies - including China, India, Turkey, Russia and Indonesia \u2013 that by 2020 will contribute to 45 percent of global GDP. This is why teaching innovation in a place like Abu Dhabi is of particular importance.   We are reaching out to others in the country and in the region for their support. This includes the owners of successful family-run businesses - or their children who tend to be western educated and want to be involved in socially responsible projects. We are in touch with Two Four 54, the Abu Dhabi Media Zone Authority and other UAE government agencies.   There are entrepreneurially inclined people across the Middle East seeking a more politically stable place to live. They are risk oriented and can move to any place to make a living. We believe that UAE can be perfect home for them.   The processes developed in Silicon Valley can be applied in the Arab region to create a locally grown entrepreneurial and turn this whole Arab region into thriving entrepreneurial leader in the world.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

Human rights have a history that is national, regional, and international. Part I of the course presents an overview of the theory, history, and legal frameworks of the international human rights movement. Part II will explore these themes through the lens of the Argentinian experience. Students will study human rights violations during the Dirty War and national and international responses that sought to expose abuses, marshal human rights institutions to take action against them. We also will examine efforts within Argentina over the last 30 years to balance reconciliation and accountability for past abuses. In Part III, we will examine current human rights challenges facing governments, civil society groups, international organizations, and businesses today. The course will include field trips around Buenos Aires and guest speakers with direct experience in the human rights movement in Argentina.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.
