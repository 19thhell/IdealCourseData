Civil resistance is not the same as opting out of society or having views that go against the grain. It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.

Seeking to expand upon basic historical knowledge of colonization, the unit focuses on the interaction of indigenous peoples and their conquerors. Comparisons will be made between European and indigenous groups artistic styles, concentrating on the didactic art used for conversion and the indigenous art that survived despite Spanish orders to destroy it. Important will be discussions of religious iconography, art as a form of resistance, and the cultural meaning of art. Finally, students will identify the hybrid style that emerged from the acculturation within the region. Two background lessons will serve as a starting point for the final \u2018Idols behind altars\u2019 project. In this project students create their own artwork that highlights both indigenous groups and Spanish artistic style and culture.      The unit will address the following essential questions:   \u25cf What should we do when our belief systems are attacked?   \u25cf How do the movements of people and ideas affect world history and who we are today?   \u25cf In what ways does art reflect changes in society?   \u25cf In what ways can art be a tool for conversion and/ or rebellion?      These materials were created in 2011 by Naomi Barak, a Studio Art/Art History teacher at the Cypress Hills Collegiate Preparatory School, as part of the 2011 Yale-NYU Summer Institute on Colonial Latin America.
