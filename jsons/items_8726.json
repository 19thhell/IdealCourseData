Reisner: 19.1549          This A-Group bowl represents a pinnacle of ceramic art. A-Group vessels were formed by hand and their walls thinned by use of a paddle. When partially dry they were burnished with a smooth stone (a delicate task in the case of such thin walls), and geometric designs imitating basketry were often painted on the exterior. The vessels would then have been fired in an open fire\u2014no kilns of this period have been found.          The rich black color of the vessels\u2019 interior would have been formed by smoke and by reduction firing, in which oxygen was restricted by turning the vessels upside down. The bowls were undoubtedly used in feasting contexts, perhaps for the beer that is an important component of feasts in other African societies. This particular vessel was recovered by George A. Reisner during his 1907\u20138 season of survey near the Aswan dam, in preparation for flooding at a time when British officials were making plans to raise the level of the dam.

Its closest parallels, however, are to Egyptian pots of the Second Intermediate Period (1700\u20131550 BC). Yet the vessel was clearly made in Nubia, using Nile clay and Nubian forming and firing techniques. It suggests greater Nubian knowledge of Egyptian material culture during this period, perhaps derived at least as much from spoils of war as from trade.            An undecipherable inscription incised on the vessel may represent a local potter\u2019s effort to imitate Egyptian hieroglyphic signs, or it may be an attempt to spell a name or word in the language of Kush.

While the excavator called them \u201cteapots,\u201d and it is certain that they were used for pouring liquids, we do not know whether they were used in domestic or ritual contexts, or both.            As a very large animal that could be extremely dangerous when it or its young were threatened, and quite destructive of fields when hungry, the hippopotamus was a potent symbol in the Nile Valley. Successful hunts by boat and harpoon were frequently portrayed in tombs of kings and officials in Egypt. In addition, hippos were associated with the deities Seth (anger, evil, chaos) and Taweret (protector of women and infants). Taweret, with the head of a hippopotamus, the back of a crocodile, and the paws of a lion, was also represented in inlays found at Kerma and this association may be the most relevant in the Nubian context.

It was excavated at Kerma by George A. Reisner, who thought it was originally an inlay. Since faience at Kerma could have been locally manufactured or have come from Egypt, it is not certain whether this head represents an Egyptian or a Nubian perspective.

The man in the foreground is marked as Nubian rather than Egyptian by his facial features, particularly his nose and lips. The relief illustrates one way in which Nubians were represented in Egyptian art. The form of this carving and even the size of the block itself mark it as part of the innovative sculptural program begun in the reign of Akhenaten (1353\u20131336 BC) in his newly built ceremonial capital city at El-Amarna. Akhenaten campaigned in Nubia and built temples and towns from the 2nd cataract to the 4th cataract at Sesebi, Kawa, and Gebel Barkal.

During the Egyptian occupation of Nubia (1550\u20131070 bc) and possibly earlier, worship of the Egyptian god Amun was introduced into Nubia. The Nubian form of Amun was depicted with a ram\u2019s head, and statues of Nubian kings show them wearing ram\u2019s-head amulets on each shoulder.

A complex goddess, Hathor was patroness of love, supporter of kingship, and consort of the god Re. This pendant was found in the tomb of one of Piye\u2019s queens and may have symbolized Hathor\u2019s roles.

Like other royal Kushite statues, it is modeled on Egyptian sculpture, but with distinctive Nubian iconography, including the tight cap-crown with double uraeus-serpent (instead of the single uraeus on Egyptian statues). Three ram\u2019s-head amulets representing Amun are suspended on a cord around the king\u2019s neck and over his shoulders.            The statue was found broken in pieces, presumably destroyed in the raid of the Egyptian King Psammetichus II in 593 BC. The head of this statue was buried in a cache in the Amun Temple along with other royal statues that had also been damaged in the raid; the body was found in a nearby temple.

In Egyptian belief, Osiris, the god of the underworld, could require the dead to perform manual labor, so elite burials would be supplied with shawabti figures, often holding tools, to work on behalf of the tomb owner. Although all the pyramid tombs of Napatan kings had been disturbed and mostly looted, the tomb of Senkamanisken still contained over 1,100 shawabtis, some made of faience and others of stone.
