Our curriculum of advanced tax courses taught by the country\u2019s most respected academics and leading practitioners have been offered to law students for nearly 70 years. The Master of Studies in Law (MSL) in Taxation extends this tradition further, offering the benefits of this curriculum for the first time to non-lawyers in a convenient online format.   In today\u2019s environment, lawyers, accountants and economists interact more closely than in the past. Responding to the growing demand from accountants and non-lawyer financial professionals for targeted legal instruction, the MSL in Taxation is specifically designed to enhance the intellectual and professional toolkit of those who advise on the tax aspects of sophisticated business transactions.   While the MSL will not prepare or qualify students for the practice of law or to sit for any state bar exam, it does provide experienced tax professionals an opportunity to study tax law as it is taught here at NYU Law.   The Online Experience   MSL students, who complete the program on a part-time basis, participate in online tax courses by viewing videos of courses offered on campus, interacting with their professors and classmates using online discussion boards, and taking a final exam at the end of each course. Students can customize classwork around their work schedules by watching recordings of the same lectures offered to students in the LLM in Taxation via streaming video at convenient times.   Final exams, while scheduled on particular dates, can be completed on a computer at home or in the office by using a proctoring device.   Courses   In most semesters, more than twenty different online courses are offered, including Corporate Tax, Partnership Tax, International Tax, Taxation of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, and Tax Policy. Intensive modules of semester-long classes are also offered during the summer months.   Courses Offered during the 2014-2015 Academic Year:           Corporate Tax I   Corporate Tax II   Partnership Tax   International Tax I   International Tax II   International Tax III   Taxation of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions       Taxation of Private Equity Transactions   Estate Planning   Multistate Tax: Sales and Gross Receipts Taxation   Multistate Tax: Income Taxation   Taxation of Executive Compensation   Timing Issues and Income Tax             Watch an excerpt of a Corporate Tax II course taught by NYU Law Professor Joshua Blank.   Degree and Residency Requirements   Students earn their degree by successfully completing a curriculum of entirely online tax courses on a part-time basis over a period of up to five years. Students who already hold a master\u2019s degree can complete the MSL program in 24 credits; for all other students, the degree requires 30 credits of study.   MSL students are evaluated separately from LLM students and receive high pass/pass/fail grades rather than the traditional letter grades.   Because our online programs are not available in all states, prospective MSL applicants should review information regarding State Restrictions and Procedures prior to submitting an application.  &amp;lt;div style=\"display:inline;\"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" style=\"border-style:none;\" alt=\"\" src=\"//googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1020448132/?value=0&amp;amp;amp;label=tSkKCMTm0AcQhJvL5gM&amp;amp;amp;guid=ON&amp;amp;amp;script=0\"/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;                                                         Apply Now           Application Deadlines   Application Instructions   Online Application   Transcript Form   Recommendation Form   Mailing Address:   Office of Graduate Admissions   NYU School of Law   139 MacDougal Street   Suite C-10   New York, NY 10012-1301   Contact Us:  Telephone: +1 212 998 6060   law.grad.moreinfo@nyu.edu                 State-of-the-Art Technology           The Law School continually evaluates new technologies for use in connection with online course delivery and examination to ensure our students benefit from secure and innovative learning platforms.

The graduate tax faculty includes several of the country\u2019s leading academic figures in taxation as well as tax practitioners who combine an extraordinary commitment to teaching with practical knowledge accumulated over years of experience at the most sophisticated levels of tax practice. Alumni of the program are found in prominent positions in tax practice, government, the judiciary and academia.   The program, offered on a full-time and part-time basis, is designed to provide a firm grounding in all of the major areas of federal taxation, offering over 50 graduate-level courses annually. While not an application requirement, students are expected to have taken a basic income taxation course before enrolling because all advanced tax classes take a rigorous approach to their material in order to effectively address the complexities of tax law. Going beyond a narrow, mechanical understanding, faculty emphasize theoretical and policy issues in locating responsible solutions to tax problems.   Focus on Curriculum   All full-time students will be assigned a faculty adviser to help them design a program of study. Students who wish to concentrate on areas of particular interest may follow suggested courses of study in:     General Taxation   Business Taxation   International Taxation (for US-trained attorneys)   Estate Planning   Tax Policy     In addition to these areas of concentration, a variety of courses are offered in other areas, such as state and local taxation, taxation of executive compensation, bankruptcy taxation, and civil and criminal tax procedure. More information regarding the suggested curricula and designing an individualized course from the various tax offerings is available from the Graduate Tax Program .   Programs for Practicing Lawyers   As the top program in the nation, the perpetual challenge is to be innovative, flexible and responsive to students\u2019 needs as well as the needs of the marketplace. For many years, practicing lawyers have enrolled in the LLM in Taxation on a part-time basis, benefitting from some evening classes taught by the nation\u2019s leading tax practitioners, the intensive tax courses offered by the Graduate Tax Program during the summer months, and some online classes. Also offered on a part-time basis are:     the Executive LLM in Taxation , which may be completed entirely online;   the Advanced Professional Certificate in Taxation , a 12-credit program of advanced tax classes in a specific area of concentration.

Our curriculum of advanced tax courses taught by the country\u2019s most respected academics and leading practitioners have been offered to law students for nearly 70 years. The Master of Studies in Law (MSL) in Taxation extends this tradition further, offering the benefits of this curriculum for the first time to non-lawyers in a convenient online format.   In today\u2019s environment, lawyers, accountants and economists interact more closely than in the past. Responding to the growing demand from accountants and non-lawyer financial professionals for targeted legal instruction, the MSL in Taxation is specifically designed to enhance the intellectual and professional toolkit of those who advise on the tax aspects of sophisticated business transactions.   While the MSL will not prepare or qualify students for the practice of law or to sit for any state bar exam, it does provide experienced tax professionals an opportunity to study tax law as it is taught here at NYU Law.   The Online Experience   MSL students, who complete the program on a part-time basis, participate in online tax courses by viewing videos of courses offered on campus, interacting with their professors and classmates using online discussion boards, and taking a final exam at the end of each course. Students can customize classwork around their work schedules by watching recordings of the same lectures offered to students in the LLM in Taxation via streaming video at convenient times.   Final exams, while scheduled on particular dates, can be completed on a computer at home or in the office by using a proctoring device.   Courses   In most semesters, more than twenty different online courses are offered, including Corporate Tax, Partnership Tax, International Tax, Taxation of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, and Tax Policy. Intensive modules of semester-long classes are also offered during the summer months.   Courses Offered during the 2014-2015 Academic Year:           Corporate Tax I   Corporate Tax II   Partnership Tax   International Tax I   International Tax II   International Tax III   Taxation of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions       Taxation of Private Equity Transactions   Estate Planning   Multistate Tax: Sales and Gross Receipts Taxation   Multistate Tax: Income Taxation   Taxation of Executive Compensation   Timing Issues and Income Tax             Watch an excerpt of a Corporate Tax II course taught by NYU Law Professor Joshua Blank.   Degree and Residency Requirements   Students earn their degree by successfully completing a curriculum of entirely online tax courses on a part-time basis over a period of up to five years. Students who already hold a master\u2019s degree can complete the MSL program in 24 credits; for all other students, the degree requires 30 credits of study.   MSL students are evaluated separately from LLM students and receive high pass/pass/fail grades rather than the traditional letter grades.   Because our online programs are not available in all states, prospective MSL applicants should review information regarding State Restrictions and Procedures prior to submitting an application.  &amp;lt;div style=\"display:inline;\"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" style=\"border-style:none;\" alt=\"\" src=\"//googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1020448132/?value=0&amp;amp;amp;label=tSkKCMTm0AcQhJvL5gM&amp;amp;amp;guid=ON&amp;amp;amp;script=0\"/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;                                                         Apply Now           Application Deadlines   Application Instructions   Online Application   Transcript Form   Recommendation Form   Mailing Address:   Office of Graduate Admissions   NYU School of Law   139 MacDougal Street   Suite C-10   New York, NY 10012-1301   Contact Us:  Telephone: +1 212 998 6060   law.grad.moreinfo@nyu.edu                 State-of-the-Art Technology           The Law School continually evaluates new technologies for use in connection with online course delivery and examination to ensure our students benefit from secure and innovative learning platforms.   Online courses are offered in high-resolution video, using the same technology that popular video-on-demand services use to deliver movies. Each course is recorded by multiple live camera operators and a director, not by a fixed camera at the back of the room. Most professors use a \u201csmart tablet\u201d that displays the professor\u2019s handwriting electronically in a separate window in each course video.   Watch a demonstration of the many features of the state-of-the-art system used in our online classes.   Students who take exams remotely are provided with an exam proctoring device which easily connects to all Windows-based computers which meet the minimum system requirements established by the Law School\u2019s Office of Information and Technology Services.

The graduate tax faculty includes several of the country\u2019s leading academic figures in taxation as well as tax practitioners who combine an extraordinary commitment to teaching with practical knowledge accumulated over years of experience at the most sophisticated levels of tax practice. Alumni of the program are found in prominent positions in tax practice, government, the judiciary and academia.   The program, offered on a full-time and part-time basis, is designed to provide a firm grounding in all of the major areas of federal taxation, offering over 50 graduate-level courses annually. While not an application requirement, students are expected to have taken a basic income taxation course before enrolling because all advanced tax classes take a rigorous approach to their material in order to effectively address the complexities of tax law. Going beyond a narrow, mechanical understanding, faculty emphasize theoretical and policy issues in locating responsible solutions to tax problems.   Focus on Curriculum   All full-time students will be assigned a faculty adviser to help them design a program of study. Students who wish to concentrate on areas of particular interest may follow suggested courses of study in:     General Taxation   Business Taxation   International Taxation (for US-trained attorneys)   Estate Planning   Tax Policy     In addition to these areas of concentration, a variety of courses are offered in other areas, such as state and local taxation, taxation of executive compensation, bankruptcy taxation, and civil and criminal tax procedure. More information regarding the suggested curricula and designing an individualized course from the various tax offerings is available from the Graduate Tax Program .   Programs for Practicing Lawyers   As the top program in the nation, the perpetual challenge is to be innovative, flexible and responsive to students\u2019 needs as well as the needs of the marketplace. For many years, practicing lawyers have enrolled in the LLM in Taxation on a part-time basis, benefitting from some evening classes taught by the nation\u2019s leading tax practitioners, the intensive tax courses offered by the Graduate Tax Program during the summer months, and some online classes. Also offered on a part-time basis are:     the Executive LLM in Taxation , which may be completed entirely online;   the Advanced Professional Certificate in Taxation , a 12-credit program of advanced tax classes in a specific area of concentration.
