          NYUAD Women in Computing in the Arab World Conference 2015     The participation of women in Computing in the Arab world is an important and timely topic. At a time when female enrollment in Computer Science in the US has fallen from 37 percent in the early 80\u2019s to a dismal rate nearing 20 percent today. In the Arab world, our preliminary research findings indicate that females comprise the majority of undergraduate students studying Computer Science in several Arab countries.     This conference explores our research findings focusing on representations, the opportunities as well as the diverse challenges facing women in computing in the Arab world. Prominent regional and international women in computer science discuss research and innovation in computing, opportunities for collaboration throughout the region and world, women enrollment in computer science, entrepreneurship, the role of women in tech start-ups, Women VC\u2019s, promotion, gender gap, and positive trends as well as difficulties in the field.

          NYUAD Women in Computing in the Arab World Conference 2015     The participation of women in Computing in the Arab world is an important and timely topic. At a time when female enrollment in Computer Science in the US has fallen from 37 percent in the early 80\u2019s to a dismal rate nearing 20 percent today. In the Arab world, our preliminary research findings indicate that females comprise the majority of undergraduate students studying Computer Science in several Arab countries.     This conference explores our research findings focusing on representations, the opportunities as well as the diverse challenges facing women in computing in the Arab world. Prominent regional and international women in computer science discuss research and innovation in computing, opportunities for collaboration throughout the region and world, women enrollment in computer science, entrepreneurship, the role of women in tech start-ups, Women VC\u2019s, promotion, gender gap, and positive trends as well as difficulties in the field.

          NYUAD Women in Computing in the Arab World Conference 2015     The participation of women in Computing in the Arab world is an important and timely topic. At a time when female enrollment in Computer Science in the US has fallen from 37 percent in the early 80\u2019s to a dismal rate nearing 20 percent today. In the Arab world, our preliminary research findings indicate that females comprise the majority of undergraduate students studying Computer Science in several Arab countries.     This conference explores our research findings focusing on representations, the opportunities as well as the diverse challenges facing women in computing in the Arab world. Prominent regional and international women in computer science discuss research and innovation in computing, opportunities for collaboration throughout the region and world, women enrollment in computer science, entrepreneurship, the role of women in tech start-ups, Women VC\u2019s, promotion, gender gap, and positive trends as well as difficulties in the field.
