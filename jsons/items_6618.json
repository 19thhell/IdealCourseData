Description       Identity: the ways in which we see ourselves; the ways in which others see us; the dynamic relationship between these two seemingly distinct and often irreconcilable poles is the underlying theme of this first-year research seminar. We focus specifically on the ways in which we create, build, rebuild, and live our racial and ethnic identities in constant dialogue with contemporary American societal constructions of race and ethnicity. Questions we explore include: what is race? Is it immutable? How do we know it when we see it? How is it distinct from ethnicity? What is gained and/or lost by considering or not considering race today? In what ways do other facets of identity, for example gender, sexuality, and class inform, challenge, reconstruct, or deconstruct our racial identities? We employ historical, sociological, and cultural lenses. Several short written assignments help students formulate, research, and respond to questions about racial identity in a longer final research paper.

We focus specifically on the ways in we create, build, rebuild, and live our identities in constant dialogue with contemporary American societal constructions of race and ethnicity. Questions we explore include: what is race? Is it immutable? How do we know it when we see it? How is it distinct from ethnicity? What is gained and/or lost by considering or not considering race today? In what ways do other facets of identity, for example gender, sexuality, and class inform, challenge, reconstruct, or deconstruct our racial identities? Several short written assignments help students formulate, research, and respond to questions about identity and race and ethnicity in a longer final research paper. Texts include fiction, nonfiction, plays, and film.

Description       Identity: the ways in which we see our selves; the ways in which others see us; the dynamic relationship between these two seemingly distinct and often irreconcilable poles is the underlying theme of first-year research seminar. We focus specifically on the ways in we create, build, rebuild, and live our identities in constant dialogue with contemporary American societal constructions of race and ethnicity. Questions we explore include: what is race? Is it immutable? How do we know it when we see it? How is it distinct from ethnicity? What is gained and/or lost by considering or not considering race today? In what ways do other facets of identity, for example gender, sexuality, and class inform, challenge, reconstruct, or deconstruct our racial identities? Several short written assignments help students formulate, research, and respond to questions about identity and race and ethnicity in a longer final research paper. Texts include fiction, nonfiction, plays, and film. The reading list is not set, but will likely include Dael Orlandersmith's\u00a0 Yellowman \u00a0, Tony Kushner's\u00a0 Angels in America \u00a0, Edward Said\u2019s\u00a0 Orientalism \u00a0, and David Henry Hwang's\u00a0 M.
