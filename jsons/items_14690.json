In prior years I pioneered study of HIV-1 recombination, Vpr (1) (2), the development of widely utilized and distributed research tools, including reporter viruses and latently infected cell lines that enable direct single cell analysis of HIV replication, latency and pathogenesis. Currently, we combine in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches to study viral dynamics and novel replication mechanisms (1) (2) (3) and regulatory pathways that we have discovered. I have been NIH R01 funded since 2004.         HIV suppression of the transcription factor Foxo1. The low metabolic activity of resting CD4 T cells presents an obstacle that is partially met by the ability of HIV to increase their activation state. This is achieved through the combined effects of Env, Tat and Nef on cell signaling cascades, particularly PI3K/Akt. We recently reported that HIV-1 infection of resting CD4+ T cells results in the suppression of the activity of Foxo1, a transcription factor that regulates many processes in resting T cells, including maintenance of T cell quiescence, migration, survival and differentiation. We found that suppression of Foxo1 activity involves PI3K/Akt activation, which results in Foxo1 phosphorylation and inactivation. HIV-1 suppression of Foxo1 down modulates CD62L (L-selectin), a cell surface receptor that is required for T cell migration in to lymph nodes as well as a series of genes regulating many aspects of T cell immunobiology. These findings have broad ramifications for how HIV replicates and causes disease. Foxo1 is implicated in several cancers and metabolic disorders, is a target for drug development, and we believe that the manipulation of Foxo1 by these approaches may have utility in treating HIV infection. For example, we find that inhibitors of the kinase Akt specifically kill HIV-1 infected resting T cells, while leaving uninfected cells intact. A Foxo1 inhibitor enhances infected cell survival and virus output, providing evidence that Foxo1 is the major downstream effector. We are actively investigating the molecular mechanism of HIV suppression of Foxo1, how this affects virus replication, and how intervention in the HIV/Foxo1 nexus may be therapeutically useful. These studies are being conducted in part through a collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Connick , U. Colorado, Denver.     Novel replication pathways utilizing unintegrated HIV genomes.  As a member of the retrovirus family, HIV integrates its DNA into cells' chromosomal DNA. However, this integration process is prone to failure, resulting in the accumulation of a great excess of unintegrated HIV genomes. This unintegrated DNA (uDNA) has been considered a dead end waste product without relevance to the natural history of HIV. We have established that uDNA is in fact a competent template for de novo virus production through two important mechanisms:     We recently demonstrated that HIV generates a large amount of stable uDNA in resting CD4 T cells that produces infectious virions when T cell activation follows infection. This does not occur when T cell activation precedes infection, as the replication of the cells dilutes the uDNA and its gene products below the level that supports de novo virus production. We demonstrated that uDNA establishes a stable reservoir of latent genomes in resting CD4+ T cells from which virus production can be recruited by T cell activation many weeks after infection. We are investigating the response of uDNA (PKC agonists, histone deacetylase inhibitors, P-TEFb agonists, etc.) that are under investigation as potential curative therapies. We have found that inhibiting HIV-1 integration enhances the production of latently infected cells by shunting viral genomes to the less cytopathic unintegrated pathway of replication. Models of HIV latency which utilize direct infection of resting CD4+ cells must accommodate these findings. Finally, we find that unintegrated HIV is unable to down modulate MHC Class I, a function of the Nef protein that helps HIV evade cellular immunity. We further find HIV-specific cytotoxic T cells efficiently kill cells expressing HIV proteins from unintegrated HIV-1 \u2013 in collaboration with Dr. Paul Goepfert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (manuscript in preparation).     In the second replication pathway , when more than one HIV virion infect the same cell, a uDNA genome is frequently co-resident with an integrated provirus. In this multiple infection mechanism, the integrated provirus provides factors that complement the uDNA genome, enabling it to generate genomic RNA that is packaged into virions produced by the integrated provirus. This enables uDNA to enhance the number of replicating genomes that contribute to viral diversity and genetic recombination.    Vpr. Vpr is a small HIV protein that is incorporated into virions and performs several functions, including cell cycle arrest and transactivation.  We also demonstrated that the HIV-1 Vpr protein must be delivered into infected cells at the time of infection in order for the unintegrated HIV DNA to be competent for viral expression. We are investigating the molecular pathways by which Vpr, a known transactivator and a chromatin-associated protein, enables gene expression from uDNA.    HIV-1 replication dynamics. Our research facilitate quantitative single cell analysis of HIV-1 evolution and replication, and data generated by my laboratory and many others has been fundamentally important to our understanding of HIV dynamics. For example, HIV multiple infection of cells has many consequences, including genetic recombination, virus complementation, virus competition, increased cytopathicity and increased virus production. Using a variety of cellular, molecular and immunological techniques, we are examining these processes. In collaboration with Dr. Dominik Wodarz, University of California, Irvine, we are applying the knowledge gained from our laboratory experiments to the development of quantitative models of HIV replication and pathogenesis.

In prior years I pioneered study of HIV-1 recombination, Vpr (1) (2), the development of widely utilized and distributed research tools, including reporter viruses and latently infected cell lines that enable direct single cell analysis of HIV replication, latency and pathogenesis. Currently, we combine in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches to study viral dynamics and novel replication mechanisms (1) (2) (3) and regulatory pathways that we have discovered. I have been NIH R01 funded since 2004. HIV suppression of the transcription factor Foxo1 in resting CD4+ T cells, the master regulator of T cell quiescence and homing: Although HIV replicates most efficiently in activated CD4+ T cells, during early infection resting CD4+ T cells constitute the majority of infected cells. Resting CD4+ T cells also comprise the most important latent reservoir, making HIV infection an incurable disease with the treatments that are currently available. HIV faces a series of challenges in order to replicate in resting CD4+ T cells. The low metabolic activity of these cells presents an obstacle that is partially met by the ability of HIV to increase their activation status. This is achieved through the combined effects of Env, Tat and Nef on cell signaling cascades, particularly PI3K/Akt. We recently reported that HIV-1 infection of resting CD4+ T cells results in the suppression of the activity of Foxo1, a transcription factor that regulates many processes in resting T cells, including maintenance of T cell quiescence, migration, survival and differentiation. We found that suppression of Foxo1 activity involves PI3K/Akt activation, and that Foxo1 suppression facilitates HIV-1 replication. HIV-1 suppression of Foxo1 down modulates CD62L (L-selectin), a cell surface receptor that is required for T cell migration in to lymph nodes. These findings have broad ramifications for how HIV replicates and causes disease. Foxo1 is implicated in several cancers and metabolic disorders, is a target for drug development, and we believe that the manipulation of Foxo1 by these approaches may have utility in treating HIV infection. We are actively investigating the molecular mechanism of HIV suppression of Foxo1, how this affects virus replication, and how intervention in the HIV/Foxo1 nexus may be therapeutically useful. These studies utilize a combined approach employing in vitro systems, as well as the humanized mouse model of HIV infection (in collaboration with Dr. Moriya Tsuji , Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center), and analysis of acutely infected rhesus macaques (in collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Connick , U. Colorado, Denver). Two novel replication pathways utilizing unintegrated HIV genomes: As a member of the retrovirus family, HIV integrates its DNA into cells' chromosomal DNA. However, this integration process is prone to failure, and it has been known almost since the discovery of the virus that the great majority of HIV DNA remains in an unintegrated state within cells. This viral DNA (uDNA) has been considered a dead end waste product without relevance to the natural history of HIV. We have established that uDNA is competent as a template for de novo virus production through two mechanisms.  We recently demonstrated that when HIV infects a resting CD4+ T cell, uDNA is generated that can function as a template for de novo virus production. We demonstrated that uDNA establishes a stable reservoir of latent genomes in resting CD4+ T cells from which virus production can be recruited by T cell activation many weeks after infection. We are investigating the response of uDNA to agents (PKC agonists, histone deacetylase inhibitors, P-TEFb agonists, etc.) that are under investigation as potential curative therapies. We have found that inhibiting HIV-1 integration enhances the production of latently infected cells by shunting viral genomes to the less cytopathic unintegrated pathway of replication. Models of HIV latency which utilize direct infection of resting CD4+ cells must accommodate these findings, and we are investigating how uDNA contributes to these systems. We also reported that the HIV-1 Vpr protein must be delivered into infected cells at the time of infection in order for the unintegrated HIV DNA to be competent for viral expression. We are investigating the molecular pathways by which Vpr, a known transactivator and a chromatin-associated protein, enables gene expression from uDNA. These studies combine in vitro systems, a humanized mouse model of HIV infection (in collaboration with Dr. Moriya Tsuji , Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center) as well as analysis of acutely infected rhesus macaques (in collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Connick , U. Colorado, Denver).  In the second mechanism , when a uDNA genome is co-resident in a cell with an integrated provirus, the integrated provirus provides factors that complement the uDNA genome, enabling it to generate genomic RNA that is packaged into virions produced by the integrated provirus. This enables uDNA to enhance the number of replicating genomes that contribute to viral diversity and genetic recombination. Our studies of uDNA replication through co-infection is funded by a 5 year R01 grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH. The influence of multiple infection and synaptic transmission on viral replication dynamics: HIV can transmit between cells via cell-free viral particles or through direct contact between cells resulting in the formation of virological synapses. While cell-free transmission generally delivers few or single virions into cells, synaptic transmission entails delivery of multiple virions. This multiple infection of cells has important implications for viral persistence, evolution and pathogenesis. Genetic recombination between divergent viruses contributes to HIV evolution, the emergence of drug resistance and immune escape. Additionally, during co-infection viruses can influence each other directly, increasing virus expression, decreasing latency and increasing cell death. Using a variety of cellular, molecular and immunological techniques, many of which are unique to my laboratory, we are examining each of these processes and their contributions to the replication and pathogenesis of HIV. In collaboration with Dr. Dominik Wodarz, University of California, Irvine, we are applying the knowledge gained from our laboratory experiments to the development of quantitative models of HIV replication and pathogenesis.

For example, we find that inhibitors of the kinase Akt specifically kill HIV-1 infected resting T cells, while leaving uninfected cells intact. A Foxo1 inhibitor enhances infected cell survival and virus output, providing evidence that Foxo1 is the major downstream effector. We are actively investigating the molecular mechanism of HIV suppression of Foxo1, how this affects virus replication, and how intervention in the HIV/Foxo1 nexus may be therapeutically useful. These studies are being conducted in part through a collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Connick , U. Colorado, Denver.     Novel replication pathways utilizing unintegrated HIV genomes.  As a member of the retrovirus family, HIV integrates its DNA into cells' chromosomal DNA. However, this integration process is prone to failure, resulting in the accumulation of a great excess of unintegrated HIV genomes. This unintegrated DNA (uDNA) has been considered a dead end waste product without relevance to the natural history of HIV. We have established that uDNA is in fact a competent template for de novo virus production through two important mechanisms:     We recently demonstrated that HIV generates a large amount of stable uDNA in resting CD4 T cells that produces infectious virions when T cell activation follows infection. This does not occur when T cell activation precedes infection, as the replication of the cells dilutes the uDNA and its gene products below the level that supports de novo virus production. We demonstrated that uDNA establishes a stable reservoir of latent genomes in resting CD4+ T cells from which virus production can be recruited by T cell activation many weeks after infection. We are investigating the response of uDNA (PKC agonists, histone deacetylase inhibitors, P-TEFb agonists, etc.) that are under investigation as potential curative therapies. We have found that inhibiting HIV-1 integration enhances the production of latently infected cells by shunting viral genomes to the less cytopathic unintegrated pathway of replication. Models of HIV latency which utilize direct infection of resting CD4+ cells must accommodate these findings. Finally, we find that unintegrated HIV is unable to down modulate MHC Class I, a function of the Nef protein that helps HIV evade cellular immunity. We further find HIV-specific cytotoxic T cells efficiently kill cells expressing HIV proteins from unintegrated HIV-1 \u2013 in collaboration with Dr. Paul Goepfert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (manuscript in preparation).     In the second replication pathway , when more than one HIV virion infect the same cell, a uDNA genome is frequently co-resident with an integrated provirus. In this multiple infection mechanism, the integrated provirus provides factors that complement the uDNA genome, enabling it to generate genomic RNA that is packaged into virions produced by the integrated provirus. This enables uDNA to enhance the number of replicating genomes that contribute to viral diversity and genetic recombination.    Vpr. Vpr is a small HIV protein that is incorporated into virions and performs several functions, including cell cycle arrest and transactivation.  We also demonstrated that the HIV-1 Vpr protein must be delivered into infected cells at the time of infection in order for the unintegrated HIV DNA to be competent for viral expression. We are investigating the molecular pathways by which Vpr, a known transactivator and a chromatin-associated protein, enables gene expression from uDNA.    HIV-1 replication dynamics. Our research facilitate quantitative single cell analysis of HIV-1 evolution and replication, and data generated by my laboratory and many others has been fundamentally important to our understanding of HIV dynamics. For example, HIV multiple infection of cells has many consequences, including genetic recombination, virus complementation, virus competition, increased cytopathicity and increased virus production. Using a variety of cellular, molecular and immunological techniques, we are examining these processes. In collaboration with Dr. Dominik Wodarz, University of California, Irvine, we are applying the knowledge gained from our laboratory experiments to the development of quantitative models of HIV replication and pathogenesis.

In prior years I pioneered study of HIV-1 recombination, Vpr (1) (2), the development of widely utilized and distributed research tools, including reporter viruses and latently infected cell lines that enable direct single cell analysis of HIV replication, latency and pathogenesis. Currently, we combine in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches to study viral dynamics and novel replication mechanisms (1) (2) (3) and regulatory pathways that we have discovered. I have been NIH R01 funded since 2004. HIV suppression of the transcription factor Foxo1 in resting CD4+ T cells, the master regulator of T cell quiescence and homing: Although HIV replicates most efficiently in activated CD4+ T cells, during early infection resting CD4+ T cells constitute the majority of infected cells. Resting CD4+ T cells also comprise the most important latent reservoir, making HIV infection an incurable disease with the treatments that are currently available. HIV faces a series of challenges in order to replicate in resting CD4+ T cells. The low metabolic activity of these cells presents an obstacle that is partially met by the ability of HIV to increase their activation status. This is achieved through the combined effects of Env, Tat and Nef on cell signaling cascades, particularly PI3K/Akt. We recently reported that HIV-1 infection of resting CD4+ T cells results in the suppression of the activity of Foxo1, a transcription factor that regulates many processes in resting T cells, including maintenance of T cell quiescence, migration, survival and differentiation. We found that suppression of Foxo1 activity involves PI3K/Akt activation, and that Foxo1 suppression facilitates HIV-1 replication. HIV-1 suppression of Foxo1 down modulates CD62L (L-selectin), a cell surface receptor that is required for T cell migration in to lymph nodes. These findings have broad ramifications for how HIV replicates and causes disease. Foxo1 is implicated in several cancers and metabolic disorders, is a target for drug development, and we believe that the manipulation of Foxo1 by these approaches may have utility in treating HIV infection. We are actively investigating the molecular mechanism of HIV suppression of Foxo1, how this affects virus replication, and how intervention in the HIV/Foxo1 nexus may be therapeutically useful. These studies utilize a combined approach employing in vitro systems, as well as the humanized mouse model of HIV infection (in collaboration with Dr. Moriya Tsuji , Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center), and analysis of acutely infected rhesus macaques (in collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Connick , U. Colorado, Denver). Two novel replication pathways utilizing unintegrated HIV genomes: As a member of the retrovirus family, HIV integrates its DNA into cells' chromosomal DNA. However, this integration process is prone to failure, and it has been known almost since the discovery of the virus that the great majority of HIV DNA remains in an unintegrated state within cells. This viral DNA (uDNA) has been considered a dead end waste product without relevance to the natural history of HIV. We have established that uDNA is competent as a template for de novo virus production through two mechanisms.  We recently demonstrated that when HIV infects a resting CD4+ T cell, uDNA is generated that can function as a template for de novo virus production. We demonstrated that uDNA establishes a stable reservoir of latent genomes in resting CD4+ T cells from which virus production can be recruited by T cell activation many weeks after infection. We are investigating the response of uDNA to agents (PKC agonists, histone deacetylase inhibitors, P-TEFb agonists, etc.) that are under investigation as potential curative therapies. We have found that inhibiting HIV-1 integration enhances the production of latently infected cells by shunting viral genomes to the less cytopathic unintegrated pathway of replication. Models of HIV latency which utilize direct infection of resting CD4+ cells must accommodate these findings, and we are investigating how uDNA contributes to these systems. We also reported that the HIV-1 Vpr protein must be delivered into infected cells at the time of infection in order for the unintegrated HIV DNA to be competent for viral expression. We are investigating the molecular pathways by which Vpr, a known transactivator and a chromatin-associated protein, enables gene expression from uDNA. These studies combine in vitro systems, a humanized mouse model of HIV infection (in collaboration with Dr. Moriya Tsuji , Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center) as well as analysis of acutely infected rhesus macaques (in collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Connick , U. Colorado, Denver).  In the second mechanism , when a uDNA genome is co-resident in a cell with an integrated provirus, the integrated provirus provides factors that complement the uDNA genome, enabling it to generate genomic RNA that is packaged into virions produced by the integrated provirus. This enables uDNA to enhance the number of replicating genomes that contribute to viral diversity and genetic recombination. Our studies of uDNA replication through co-infection is funded by a 5 year R01 grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH. The influence of multiple infection and synaptic transmission on viral replication dynamics: HIV can transmit between cells via cell-free viral particles or through direct contact between cells resulting in the formation of virological synapses. While cell-free transmission generally delivers few or single virions into cells, synaptic transmission entails delivery of multiple virions. This multiple infection of cells has important implications for viral persistence, evolution and pathogenesis. Genetic recombination between divergent viruses contributes to HIV evolution, the emergence of drug resistance and immune escape. Additionally, during co-infection viruses can influence each other directly, increasing virus expression, decreasing latency and increasing cell death. Using a variety of cellular, molecular and immunological techniques, many of which are unique to my laboratory, we are examining each of these processes and their contributions to the replication and pathogenesis of HIV. In collaboration with Dr. Dominik Wodarz, University of California, Irvine, we are applying the knowledge gained from our laboratory experiments to the development of quantitative models of HIV replication and pathogenesis.
