The primary goals of the program are to:            Provide a foundation in the clinical, behavioral and biomedical sciences that will enable the graduate to diagnose, manage and/or prevent diseases, abnormalities, and structural conditions affecting the periodontal tissues.   Engender the role of the specialist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team   Encourage residents to participate in dental education and to develop a philosophy of lifelong learning   Prepare residents to successfully qualify for the written and clinical components of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) Board Examination        The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association and fulfills all requirements for board eligibility as stated by the American Academy of Periodontology.   Program Strengths        Diverse clinical faculty, consisting of full and part-time members, many of whom hold joint appointments in the biomedical sciences or the Department of Implant Dentistry   Diverse and large patient population, which provides a wide range of clinical experiences   Opportunities for basic and/or clinical research within the College or through collaboration with the adjacent NYU Medical Center   Intensive didactic and clinical programs that focus on advanced and innovative approaches to therapy   Close collaboration with the Advanced Education Programs in Endodontics, Prosthodontics, and Orthodontics.                                                    Didactic Program                                  The didactic program embodies a formal curriculum in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences that has been developed specifically for the Advanced Education Program in Periodontics. The didactic program in the first year is largely devoted to the biomedical sciences, and residents experience a curriculum that constitutes a rich foundation in the relevant biomedical sciences specifically designed to prepare them for patient care. In addition to the biomedical sciences, first-year residents are also introduced to the fundamentals of clinical periodontics through a didactic curriculum that includes an extensive review of the classical literature, an in-depth review of anatomical pathophysiology, an introduction to advanced clinical periodontics, a series of interdisciplinary case reports, and an in-depth review of oral medicine. In the second and third years of the program, residents participate in an in-depth didactic program in the clinical sciences, with emphasis on more advanced diagnostic, treatment planning, and surgical and non-surgical therapeutic techniques.      Overall, approximately 20 percent of the program consists of didactic content. In the first year, courses in the biomedical sciences focus on topics such as Craniofacial Development, Biology of Bone, Research Techniques, Clinical Pharmacology, Head and Neck Anatomy, Host Response, and Pain and Anxiety Management. In addition, residents must complete a course in pedagogical techniques (Introduction to Pedagogy) and are expected to participate in the teaching program at the undergraduate (DDS) level. Supplementing the biomedical sciences are courses in the clinical sciences, which include (Classic) Literature Review I, Periodontics Clinic, and Periodontal Pathology I. In addition, all residents must successfully qualify in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS).      The curriculum in the second year includes a course specifically designed to provide basic analytical skills in assessing the scientific literature. Additional courses in the second and third years focus on the clinical sciences and include Surgical Implant Dentistry, Oral Implantology I, Periodontal Prosthesis, (Classic) Literature Review II, Current Literature III, Principles of Minor Tooth Movement, Oral Pathology Laboratory, Systemic Links to Periodontal Diseases, Periodontal Pathology II, and Practice Management. Second and third-year residents also rotate through the Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing facility, a 2,000-bed, long-term care health center, one of the largest facilities of its kind in the Northeast.      In additional to formal courses, throughout all three years, lectures, seminars, and case conferences that integrate the biomedical and clinical sciences constitute a vital part of the program. Residents actively participate in these sessions as part of their training and frequently serve as seminar leaders. Emphasis is placed on a biologic orientation and application of these principles to the clinical management of periodontal diseases. Informal academic gatherings are arranged with outstanding clinicians and scientists in periodontology and allied fields to provide a unique source of stimulation and knowledge.                                                              Clinical Program                               The clinical component of the program constitutes approximately 65 percent of the curriculum and is a major strength of the program. Situated in an urban center and adjacent to one of the major medical centers in the Northeast, (NYU Langone Medical Center), the periodontics clinic has available one of the largest patient pools nationally, representing a full range of periodontal diseases and conditions. In addition to conventional surgical and non-surgical modalities of periodontal therapy, residents gain broad experience in the following advanced surgical procedures:        Implant dentistry, including preparation of the implant site, as well as implant placement itself. Residents are trained in a number of site development strategies, including sinus lift, ridge augmentation, and guided bone regeneration. This is in conjunction with training in those phases of the procedure that are specifically involved in the actual surgical placement of the implant, employing a variety of implant-placement systems.   Functional and aesthetic surgical procedures, including hard and soft tissue grafting procedures.   Regenerative surgical procedures involving autogenous, allograft, and alloplastic bone substances, often in conjunction with the application of either two-stage non-resorbable, or single-stage, biodegradable, membrane barriers. In addition, advanced clinical training is provided in periodontal therapies in conjunction with therapies that address various endodontic, orthodontic, and prosthodontic conditions.                                                                Research Program                                  To obtain a general understanding of theory and methods of scientific research, all residents are required to engage in some form of scholarly activity. Residents are expected to be able to identify basic research design elements, specify research questions, evaluate types of study designs, and understand the role of statistics in scientific decision making. Structured, formal research activity is available through a master's degree offered by NYUCD, either in biomaterial science, biology/oral biology, or clinical research. Alternatively, residents may choose to prepare formal case reports and/or literature reviews for publication, present findings at national or regional professional meetings, or participate in basic or clinical research activities of the department or College.                                                              Teaching Program                                  Students obtain experience teaching dental students at the undergraduate level.                                                              Length of the Program                                  This is a 3-year (36 months) postdoctoral certificate program for the specialty practice of Periodontics. The program runs July 1 through June 30.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .

The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The long affiliation between NYU and Bellevue Hospital has enabled the program to fulfill its mission in training postdoctoral students to become leaders in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan.   Didactic training in biomedical sciences takes place at the College of Dentistry and the Medical Center. A wealth of clinical experience is achieved at the affiliate teaching hospitals. These include Tisch Hospital - NYU Medical Center, Lenox Hill Hospital and The Harbor Healthcare System - Veterans Administration Hospital.   Learning Goals for the Program   Read complete Learning Goals and Objectives here &gt;&gt;&gt;   Accreditation Status   The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. Each year two applicants are accepted into the six-year OMS/MD program and one applicant is accepted into the four-year OMS certificate program.   Residency Program Objectives   The objective of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery program is to prepare graduates for a successful and productive career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The curriculum is designed to develop the clinical, academic, and communicative skills that will provide for diversified career options. The educational experience is progressive in nature offering increasing responsibilities as residents proceed through the program. A unique feature of this program is immediate participation in all aspects of patient care.   Graduates of the program will be prepared to pursue contemporary full scope Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery practice, obtain medical New York state licensure (6-year residents), and be prepared for the rigors of specialty board examination.   Program Outline   Six Year Residency/ Integrated MD Curriculum   The six-year integrated MD training program has been developed to prepare the graduated dentist an academic and/ or private practice career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. It is an integrated clinical and didactic program designed to meet the requirements leading to certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Upon completion of the residency program, the candidate will receive a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, a certificate of completion for one year of General Surgery residency, and a specialty certificate in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Students/ residents enrolled in medical school are responsible for the tuition costs.   The didactic training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery begins with postgraduate courses in craniofacial development, head and neck anatomy, bone biology, and physical diagnosis. These essential foundation courses are supplemented by certification in ACLS, PALS, and ATLS. Each Tuesday morning is dedicated to selected topics in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This includes but is not limited to:     Maxillofacial Trauma   Pathologic lesions of the head and neck   Correction of dentofacial deformities   Maxillofacial Reconstruction   Temporomandibular joint surgery   Dentoalveolar surgery   Ambulatory general anesthesia and deep sedation   Cleft lip and palate repair   Management of odontogenic infections   Dental implants   Management of facial pain   Facial aesthetic surgery   Coding and nomenclature   Risk management     Monday morning attending conference reviews each case from the preceding week. The Chair and faculty in the Pathology Department at the College teach Oral Pathology two times a month.   In addition, there are regularly scheduled multidisciplinary conferences in dentofacial deformities, facial trauma, craniofacial-cleft lip and palate, and Head and Neck Tumor Board.                                                  Year One                               The first year of the program consists of six months on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service and six months in the C 21 Medical School Curriculum. Curriculum for the 21st Century, or C 21, provides students with patient- centered and diseased- focused medical education. Please visit http://school.med.nyu.edu for further information. In addition, the resident completes Basic Science Courses at NYU College of Dentistry and a Physical Diagnosis Course at NYU School of Medicine.

In the beginning of the second year, the resident spends several months back on the OMS service and continues in the C 21. In January of Year 2, the resident starts the medical school clinical clerkships. The clerkships continue throughout the third year and the USMLE Step I and II are taken after completion of the clerkships. A mandatory rotation on the Anesthesia Service is started during the final months of the third year.

The primary goals of the program are to:            Provide a foundation in the clinical, behavioral and biomedical sciences that will enable the graduate to diagnose, manage and/or prevent diseases, abnormalities, and structural conditions affecting the periodontal tissues.   Engender the role of the specialist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team   Encourage residents to participate in dental education and to develop a philosophy of lifelong learning   Prepare residents to successfully qualify for the written and clinical components of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) Board Examination        The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association and fulfills all requirements for board eligibility as stated by the American Academy of Periodontology.   Program Strengths        Diverse clinical faculty, consisting of full and part-time members, many of whom hold joint appointments in the biomedical sciences or the Department of Implant Dentistry   Diverse and large patient population, which provides a wide range of clinical experiences   Opportunities for basic and/or clinical research within the College or through collaboration with the adjacent NYU Medical Center   Intensive didactic and clinical programs that focus on advanced and innovative approaches to therapy   Close collaboration with the Advanced Education Programs in Endodontics, Prosthodontics, and Orthodontics.                                                    Didactic Program                                  The didactic program embodies a formal curriculum in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences that has been developed specifically for the Advanced Education Program in Periodontics. The didactic program in the first year is largely devoted to the biomedical sciences, and residents experience a curriculum that constitutes a rich foundation in the relevant biomedical sciences specifically designed to prepare them for patient care. In addition to the biomedical sciences, first-year residents are also introduced to the fundamentals of clinical periodontics through a didactic curriculum that includes an extensive review of the classical literature, an in-depth review of anatomical pathophysiology, an introduction to advanced clinical periodontics, a series of interdisciplinary case reports, and an in-depth review of oral medicine. In the second and third years of the program, residents participate in an in-depth didactic program in the clinical sciences, with emphasis on more advanced diagnostic, treatment planning, and surgical and non-surgical therapeutic techniques.      Overall, approximately 20 percent of the program consists of didactic content. In the first year, courses in the biomedical sciences focus on topics such as Craniofacial Development, Biology of Bone, Research Techniques, Clinical Pharmacology, Head and Neck Anatomy, Host Response, and Pain and Anxiety Management. In addition, residents must complete a course in pedagogical techniques (Introduction to Pedagogy) and are expected to participate in the teaching program at the undergraduate (DDS) level. Supplementing the biomedical sciences are courses in the clinical sciences, which include (Classic) Literature Review I, Periodontics Clinic, and Periodontal Pathology I. In addition, all residents must successfully qualify in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS).      The curriculum in the second year includes a course specifically designed to provide basic analytical skills in assessing the scientific literature. Additional courses in the second and third years focus on the clinical sciences and include Surgical Implant Dentistry, Oral Implantology I, Periodontal Prosthesis, (Classic) Literature Review II, Current Literature III, Principles of Minor Tooth Movement, Oral Pathology Laboratory, Systemic Links to Periodontal Diseases, Periodontal Pathology II, and Practice Management. Second and third-year residents also rotate through the Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing facility, a 2,000-bed, long-term care health center, one of the largest facilities of its kind in the Northeast.      In additional to formal courses, throughout all three years, lectures, seminars, and case conferences that integrate the biomedical and clinical sciences constitute a vital part of the program. Residents actively participate in these sessions as part of their training and frequently serve as seminar leaders. Emphasis is placed on a biologic orientation and application of these principles to the clinical management of periodontal diseases. Informal academic gatherings are arranged with outstanding clinicians and scientists in periodontology and allied fields to provide a unique source of stimulation and knowledge.                                                              Clinical Program                               The clinical component of the program constitutes approximately 65 percent of the curriculum and is a major strength of the program. Situated in an urban center and adjacent to one of the major medical centers in the Northeast, (NYU Langone Medical Center), the periodontics clinic has available one of the largest patient pools nationally, representing a full range of periodontal diseases and conditions. In addition to conventional surgical and non-surgical modalities of periodontal therapy, residents gain broad experience in the following advanced surgical procedures:        Implant dentistry, including preparation of the implant site, as well as implant placement itself. Residents are trained in a number of site development strategies, including sinus lift, ridge augmentation, and guided bone regeneration. This is in conjunction with training in those phases of the procedure that are specifically involved in the actual surgical placement of the implant, employing a variety of implant-placement systems.   Functional and aesthetic surgical procedures, including hard and soft tissue grafting procedures.   Regenerative surgical procedures involving autogenous, allograft, and alloplastic bone substances, often in conjunction with the application of either two-stage non-resorbable, or single-stage, biodegradable, membrane barriers. In addition, advanced clinical training is provided in periodontal therapies in conjunction with therapies that address various endodontic, orthodontic, and prosthodontic conditions.                                                                Research Program                                  To obtain a general understanding of theory and methods of scientific research, all residents are required to engage in some form of scholarly activity. Residents are expected to be able to identify basic research design elements, specify research questions, evaluate types of study designs, and understand the role of statistics in scientific decision making. Structured, formal research activity is available through a master's degree offered by NYUCD, either in biomaterial science, biology/oral biology, or clinical research. Alternatively, residents may choose to prepare formal case reports and/or literature reviews for publication, present findings at national or regional professional meetings, or participate in basic or clinical research activities of the department or College.                                                              Teaching Program                                  Students obtain experience teaching dental students at the undergraduate level.                                                              Length of the Program                                  This is a 3-year (36 months) postdoctoral certificate program for the specialty practice of Periodontics.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .
