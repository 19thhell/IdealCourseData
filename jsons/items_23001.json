What does this mean?     The NYU SoM IRB is responsible for ensuring compliance with University policy, Federal requirements and the ethical principles of the Belmont Report. As part of this responsibility, the IRB is expected to provide for post- approval monitoring of research. The QA&amp;I Review is designed to meet this requirement through a pro-active and collaborative process with investigators. The purpose of the QA&amp;I Review is to provide information to faculty and staff on regulatory compliance and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines related to human research participants, data collection and data management; to verify that safeguards protecting the rights and welfare of human research participants are met; to verify investigator adherence to the study design as approved by the IRB-approved protocol, and applicable regulatory requirements; and rarely, to investigate complaints and/or allegations of noncompliance with research regulations. The review is meant to be a collaborative process whereby the auditor assesses compliance (regulatory, policy, approved protocol, etc.) and helps the investigator resolve/correct problems and discrepancies and provides recommendations for process improvements.     What does a QA/QI Review entail?     A QA&amp;I Review will entail a visit to your site. The full QA&amp;I review usually takes an entire day on-site; however, this may vary depending on the complexity of the study and the enrollment. It is usually a good idea for the PI and/or study coordinator to be there in the morning before the visit begins and at the end of the day when the review is over. The PI does not need to be present for the entire review unless s/he wants to be. However, a staff member should be available to provide the auditor with the necessary documents, files and binders and answer any questions (or to contact the PI if there is an urgent question).     What will the auditor be looking at during the site visit?     The scope of review or investigation may vary depending on a number of factors. All site reviews or investigations will be preceded by a Notification Letter from the QA&amp;I Division that includes specific details about the precise Scope of Review. The Scope of Review may include some, or all of the following items:      The auditor will be looking to see documentation that you are following your approved protocol and study procedures.      The auditor will want to see all study related documents including:       original signed consent forms        subject files        inclusion/exclusion checklists        experimental drug/device accountability        AEs, SAEs        regulatory files (GCP Essential Documents) such IRB files and correspondence, sponsor correspondence        FDA files and related documents (if applicable)        enrollment logs        staff signature logs (delegation of responsibility logs)        laboratory certifications and normal reference ranges        Investigator Brochure       Can I prepare ahead of time?     Yes, there are a few things you can do to prepare ahead of time. Review each consent form to ensure the correct version was used and that it has been signed/dated properly by the subject. If you find a problem with a consent form, make a note in the study file and fix the problem as soon as possible (notify IRB). Review your regulatory binders (IRB, FDA, etc.) and make sure you have all IRB, sponsor, FDA correspondence in the Regulatory File and that the files are in order. Review and update the subject enrollment log (if you have one).     What should I do if I identify problems when preparing for the on-site visit?     The most frequent advice that is given if errors or omissions are discovered is to document the event in the participant\u2019s medical record and place a signed dated memo regarding the event in the research file (known as \u201cnote to file\u201d). A report describing this event should also be submitted to the IRB along with a plan of corrective action to be taken to eliminate future occurrence of this problem. See the IRB website for the appropriate forms for reporting various events.     What happens after the review is over?     Once the auditor has completed the review, a Findings Report will be generated and sent to the PI (usually within about 1-2 weeks of the review date). The report will include any findings that need to be addressed, specified corrective actions, and a time frame by which the action needs to be completed. The report will also include any recommendations for process improvements. Once the investigator responds to the report and all the issues have been adequately addressed, the auditor will send a close out letter and the review will be finished. If any incidents of serious or continuing non-compliance are found during the review, the auditor will bring it to the PI\u2019s attention and immediately start working with the PI to address the issue.     Who receives a report of the routine on-site review or directed investigation findings?     On completion of a compliance review or directed investigation, the QA&amp;I staff will draft a report of the findings and send it to the Principal Investigator. The Principal Investigator will have 2 weeks to respond to the issues, as well as submit a Remediation Plan to avoid such occurrences in the future. The compliance review report, the PI\u2019s response and Remediation Plan will then be presented to the IRB board members.   If there are serious or reportable findings from an on-site review, the report may be distributed to some or all of the following individuals and agencies:      Department Chair      Vice Dean/Institution Official      Regulatory and/or Funding Agency     Top five deficiencies cited in FDA audits:      Failure to follow the protocol      Problems with the Informed Consent Form or the Informed Consent Process      Failure to keep complete and accurate records      Failure to account for the disposition of study drug      Failure to report adverse events      (Research Practitioner, 2004)                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]},

The most frequent advice that is given if errors or omissions are discovered is to document the event in the participant\u2019s medical record and place a signed dated memo regarding the event in the research file (known as \u201cnote to file\u201d). A report describing this event should also be submitted to the IRB along with a plan of corrective action to be taken to eliminate future occurrence of this problem. See the IRB website for the appropriate forms for reporting various events.     What happens after the review is over?     Once the auditor has completed the review, a Findings Report will be generated and sent to the PI (usually within about 1-2 weeks of the review date). The report will include any findings that need to be addressed, specified corrective actions, and a time frame by which the action needs to be completed. The report will also include any recommendations for process improvements. Once the investigator responds to the report and all the issues have been adequately addressed, the auditor will send a close out letter and the review will be finished. If any incidents of serious or continuing non-compliance are found during the review, the auditor will bring it to the PI\u2019s attention and immediately start working with the PI to address the issue.     Who receives a report of the routine on-site review or directed investigation findings?     On completion of a compliance review or directed investigation, the QA&amp;I staff will draft a report of the findings and send it to the Principal Investigator. The Principal Investigator will have 2 weeks to respond to the issues, as well as submit a Remediation Plan to avoid such occurrences in the future. The compliance review report, the PI\u2019s response and Remediation Plan will then be presented to the IRB board members.   If there are serious or reportable findings from an on-site review, the report may be distributed to some or all of the following individuals and agencies:      Department Chair      Vice Dean/Institution Official      Regulatory and/or Funding Agency     Top five deficiencies cited in FDA audits:      Failure to follow the protocol      Problems with the Informed Consent Form or the Informed Consent Process      Failure to keep complete and accurate records      Failure to account for the disposition of study drug      Failure to report adverse events      (Research Practitioner, 2004)                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}, {"content": "Quality Assurance &amp; Program Assessment | DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES                                Skip to main content                      Patient Care       Faculty &amp; Staff Directory       Events       Careers       Donate                                                                                                                                                                             DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES                    DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS                                                                                   Home   About Us   Our Services   Research   Education and Training   Contact Us                                  Home Our Services Lower New York Consortium Quality Assurance &amp; Program Assessment            Print  Email               - A + A                                         Our Services      Inpatient Services     open/close   Outpatient Services  Pediatric HIV Clinic   TB Clinic   Viral Hepatitis Clinic       open/close   Lower New York Consortium  Our History   What We Offer   Quality Assurance &amp; Program Assessment   Research   Empowering Consumers   Contact Us                                                                                                      Quality Assurance &amp; Program Assessment                                          The purpose of the Lower New York Consortium's Quality Improvement (CQI) Program is to ensure that all clients in Consortium-funded programs receive health care services in accordance with Public Health Service Guidelines and conforming to Title III, Title IV, and New York State AIDS Institute quality requirements and expectations.
