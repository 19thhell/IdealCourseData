periods in the development of cultures and civilizations around the Mediterranean basin, in the Near East, and across central Asia to the Pacific Ocean.   Abu Dhabi's location at the center of this geographical expanse makes it an ideal site for exploring the intellectual and material riches of the ancient world. This concentration encompasses a number of disciplines, including archaeology, art history, history, literature, and philosophy. In addition to regular coursework, students may also have the opportunity to participate in an archaeological excavation.                             Requirements   Four courses, distributed across at least two disciplines and/or civilizations.     Students who elect this Multidisciplinary Concentration select four courses approved by their mentor. Students are also encouraged to take a course in archaeology or material culture. NYU operates several archaeological excavations, including in the Dakhla Oasis of Egypt and in Aphrodisias, in Turkey. This fieldwork requires special training, and admission is by application. Other archaeological fieldwork opportunities are available in the UAE and the region. Students can learn more about fieldwork opportunities by consulting with the Ancient World faculty.

We study the earliest human inventions such as spears and simple tools; ponder the methods that might have been used in the construction of monolithic structures such as Stone Henge, Egyptian obelisks, and pyramids; and explore examples of technological innovations that affected the course of human history. Throughout the course, the emphasis is on developing personal approaches to creativity and innovation by studying specific examples of these attributes from the ancient world.

PHIL-AD 220 Ancient Mediterranean Philosophy                                                                   An examination of the origins of Western philosophical thought in ancient Greece and Rome, with a special focus on the views of Plato and Aristotle. Through their work, we will grapple with a range of pressing philosophical questions, including: Is happiness more than a subjective state of consciousness? Is death harmful? Do we have free will? Do we have obligations to others that override the pursuit of our own self-interest? What is the relation between the mind (or the soul) and the body? Since most of the philosophers we will be studying thought that philosophy must be systematic in its approach, we will also try to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this kind of approach to philosophical questions.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).
