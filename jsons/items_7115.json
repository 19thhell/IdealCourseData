Description       This course is designed for those who wish to deepen our relationship to nature and then learn how to apply this understanding to the challenging work of conservation biology. The art and science of conservation biology brings together leading thinking from biology, economics, anthropology, psychology, literature, art, and communications to conserve the diversity of life found on our planet. In this class we will discover how business entrepreneurs, social scientists, wildlife biologists, and artists all play an integral role in creating and delivering practical conservation solutions. We will begin with an exploration of our own relationship to the natural world. We then examine what biological diversity is, the principal threats to biological systems, and specific actions that are being taken to reverse these threats and protect life on earth. We also explore the premise that \u201cmanaging\u201d the ecology of the planet really requires us to manage ourselves and the human cultures we have created. The fieldwork of the physical and biological sciences provides the foundation from which our work as conservation biologists proceeds. However, the applied work of the social sciences, education, business, humanities and arts then serve as the tools we need to manage ourselves and create a relationship with nature that is mutually supportive. Students will be required to research and share their learnings around a selected conservation biology topic, and complete a practical project that demonstrates how each of us can make a difference in strengthening our relationship to nature. At the course conclusion students from all disciplines should see a role for themselves in the conservation work that is an essential part of our next century. Readings will include Sodhi and Erlich\u2019s Conservation Biology for All, as well as selected readings from Nabhan, Snyder, Goodall, Tempest Williams, Ackerman, Kolbert, Margulis, and others.

The goal of conservation biology is to conserve the incredible diversity of life found on our planet, and, in the process, protect our rich cultural diversity, and ourselves. We discover how business entrepreneurs, social scientists, wildlife biologists, and artists all play an integral role in achieving practical conservation solutions. We begin with an exploration of our own relationship to the natural world. We examine what biological diversity is, the principal threats to biological systems, and specific actions that are being taken to reverse these threats and protect life on earth. We also explore the premise that managing the biological wealth of the planet really requires us to manage ourselves and the human cultures we have created. The fieldwork of the physical and biological sciences provide the foundation from which our work as conservation biologists proceeds. However, the applied work of the social sciences, education, business, humanities and arts then serve as the tools we need to manage ourselves and create a relationship with nature that is mutually supportive. Readings include reserved selections from textbooks, including Richard Primack\u2019s Primer of Conservation Biology and Sarah Pilgrim\u2019s Nature and Culture , along with others from popular non-fiction authors including Bill McKibben, Gary Snyder, Terry Tempest Williams and others. At the course conclusion students from all disciplines should see a role for themselves in the conservation work that is an essential part of our next century.

Description       This course is designed for those who wish to deepen our relationship to nature and then learn how to apply this understanding to the challenging work of conservation biology. The art and science of conservation biology brings together leading thinking from biology, economics, anthropology, psychology, literature, art, and communications to conserve the diversity of life found on our planet. In this class we will discover how business entrepreneurs, social scientists, wildlife biologists, and artists all play an integral role in creating and delivering practical conservation solutions. We will begin with an exploration of our own relationship to the natural world. We then examine what biological diversity is, the principal threats to biological systems, and specific actions that are being taken to reverse these threats and protect life on earth. We also explore the premise that \u201cmanaging\u201d the ecology of the planet really requires us to manage ourselves and the human cultures we have created. The fieldwork of the physical and biological sciences provides the foundation from which our work as conservation biologists proceeds. However, the applied work of the social sciences, education, business, humanities and arts then serve as the tools we need to manage ourselves and create a relationship with nature that is mutually supportive. Students will be required to research and share their learnings around a selected conservation biology topic, and complete a practical project that demonstrates how each of us can make a difference in strengthening our relationship to nature. At the course conclusion students from all disciplines should see a role for themselves in the conservation work that is an essential part of our next century. Readings will include Sodhi and Erlich\u2019s Conservation Biology for All, as well as selected readings from Nabhan, Snyder, Goodall, Tempest Williams, Ackerman, Kolbert, Margulis, and others.

He has more than 25 years of professional experience in the design and implementation of natural resource and biodiversity conservation projects. He has worked in more than 40 countries and held a wide variety of professional positions that integrate applied work in nature conservation planning and management; forest and wildlife management; field biology; ecological monitoring; scientific communications; and environmental education. Most recently, Jim has been leading the development of landscape-scale biodiversity conservation offsets for large development projects in Africa and Latin America. From 2006-2012 Jim served as the Director of the Kinship Conservation Fellows, a ground-breaking one-month international environmental leadership program that integrates management skills with business and economic tools ( www.kinshipfellows.org ). He also was an Associate Professor of Conservation Science at the College of Santa Fe, New Mexico from 1995-2003 where he helped to create and lead an interdisciplinary undergraduate conservation science degree program, and directed an outreach and education program for teachers and educators.                                     top of page                                     Contact Information     Jim Tolisano             Part-time Faculty              jtolisano@gmail.com             1 Wash Pl, Room 619             (212) 992-6302      Download as vCard           \u00a0                                    Courses                                                   2015             Fall                            Bridging Culture and Nature: An Introduction to Conservation Science                  Mon      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                                   2014             Spring                            Bridging Culture and Nature: An Introduction to Conservation Science                  Wed      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                                   2014             Fall                            Bridging Culture and Nature: An Introduction to Conservation Science                  Mon      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                                   2013             Spring                            Bridging Culture and Nature: An Introduction to Conservation Science                  Mon      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       conservation biology; the design and management of parks and wild areas; forest ecology and restoration; human-wildlife relationships; economic and cultural valuations of nature and environmental services                                                                                                              NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
