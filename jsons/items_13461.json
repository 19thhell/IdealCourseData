(Gallatin Building), Rm. 801        Course Description   Many of our modern ideas about art, literature, architecture and its uses, politics, culture, philosophy, gender, and class derive from the brilliantly prolific period of the Renaissance.   During a three-week interdisciplinary program in beautiful and historic Florence, Italy, students will be offered a total immersion and multifaceted learning experience that is an essential beginning to understanding our modern world through the lens of the Italian Renaissance. This course explores the literature, culture, art, and thought of the Renaissance from multiple perspectives.   During their stay, students will develop and present an individualized project based on their academic interests and background and the ways in which the Renaissance has inspired them. As a quintessential Gallatin experience, the course places emphasis on the cultural and historical contexts from which the literature and art of Renaissance Florence emerged.   Readings might include the works of Dante, Pico Della Mirandola, Machiavelli, and selected female writers, as well as art texts such as Vasari's The Lives of the Artists . In addition, students will study the art of Florentine painters such as Botticelli, Giotto, and Michelangelo in the places where these works were created.   Classes are taught in English and meet four days a week. Throughout the course, students will visit museums and churches such as the Uffizi, the Duomo, the church of Santa Maria Novella, and the monastery of San Marco to engage fully with the art and architecture of Renaissance Italy.   Students are required to reside in accommodations arranged by NYU Gallatin.   Note for Gallatin students: This course fulfills 4 credits of the Interdisciplinary Seminar as well as the Humanities and Early Modern foundation requirements.

Students must have a minimum 3.0 GPA and be in good academic and disciplinary standing, must have completed at least one full-time undergraduate college semester before the travel course begins, and must be matriculated at a college or university during the Summer 2015 term.
