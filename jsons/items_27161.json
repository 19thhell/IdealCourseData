SSAW is conducted at Stonestreet's 6,000 sq. ft. film, television and internet studio, where professional directors, producers, and casting directors develop and produce movies, pilots, commercials, television and webseries. Students train and work in the same environment with access to full production and post-production facilities (including several editing systems and editors) with the guidance of constructive teachers who are industry professionals. The emphasis of the workshop is on becoming imaginative and creative actors who are both believable and interesting cinematically in any genre while embracing a wide variety of characters and material from different periods and cultures.    While screen acting can utilize many of the same techniques and tools of theater acting, there are significant differences with regard to subtext, how the current technology can be used in creative and non-limiting ways, as well as with creating organic and compelling characters that often appear in a medium or long shot but also under the magnifying glass of the close-up. Ultimately students are guided from audition to rehearsal to performance with the hopes of inspiring with ideas and stories that are meaningful to both the actor and the audience. Workshop classes include: Screen Acting &amp; Character, Muliti-Camera Screen Acting, Sit-coms, Improv &amp; Comedy on Film, Commercials &amp; the Business, the History of Screen Acting, Voice-overs and Voice on Screen, and Introduction to Audition &amp; Performance.

SSAW 1 &amp; 2 is conducted at Stonestreet's state-of-the-art film and television studio, where many professional directors, producers, and casting directors develop and produce films, pilots, television shows and commercials. Students train and work in the same environment with professional directors, casting directors, and agents. With access to full production and post-production facilities (including several editing systems and editors), students learn the unique demands of the camera, film and television scripts that may not be rich or scant, and set work. Stonestreet students experience the real challenges of the film medium by acting in production level short movies, dramatic series, sitcoms, soaps, and commercials with the guidance of professionals/teachers who help deepen their understanding of process and performance and learn to contribute, touch and inspire an audience. All production level work is edited, material that can be used for actor reels, usually made in FTWII or Independent Stonestreet, and often broadcast on Stonestreet's movie website:www.stonestreet.co All kinds of dramatic material from all periods and cultures are invited and embraced cinematically. Stonestreet students learn to become professional auditioners and self-sufficient creative actors who are both believable and interesting on camera in all areas. Additional classes include: Career Management and the Business, the History of Film Acting, Voice-overs and Voice in Film, and our Audition and Showcase Class prepare students for the professional world and expose students to industry professionals on a weekly basis. Audition Process Stonestreet Screen Acting Workshop has an interview process where prospective students learn more about the program and the studio and Stonestreet gets acquainted with the student's goals, interests, and past experience. Students should call Stonestreet Studios at 212-229-0020 and make an appointment with the assistant managing director for an interview. If necessary, students may register first, but must then schedule their interview before attending. Each semester Stonestreet accepts some directing and design students, as well as acting students from all of the different training backgrounds who wish to broaden their experience and job potential to film production, directing, and producing in addition to or instead of an acting focus.

The day-to-day studio work, not only in front of the camera but behind the camera as well, gave me the solid instruction and confidence I needed to get work in the business. From learning audition techniques to the not-so-subtle differences between stage and film acting, I was more than ready to begin my career in this field. I have often said, without exaggeration, that it was my training at Stonestreet that not only helped me land my first major role in a television series but also kept me in favor with the producers. It may be who you know that opens the door, but it is what you know that keeps you in.\" - Brian Baer (Fall/Spring 1995) \u201cStonestreet, more than any other training I've received so far, prepared me to take control of my career and run my business effectively while staying true to what I want to accomplish as an artist. \u201d- Mia Longenecker (Summer/Fall2012) \u201cStonestreet is an experience like none other student at N.Y.U. My primary studio studios taught me how to work on the job, but Stonestreet teaches you how to get the job. \u201d- Ryan Lefton (Summer/Fall2012) \"Early on this semester, I discovered that I really love writing and directing. A lot! I find it just as fulfilling as acting--if not more. I would have never realized this without Stonestreet. I'm so thankful that I've had the opportunity to handle the camera and really appreciated the opportunity to work and write on our Announcer Project, News From The Top. What a wonderful experience!

OART-UT 1916 Acting for the Stage and Screen 8 units Prerequisite: Applicants to the acting program should have a minimum of one year acting training or equivalent.    Acting for Stage and Screen is the Open Arts Studio at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. It is designed for a select, diverse student body, ready to challenge and stretch the physical and emotional instrument of the actor. The studio is dedicated to developing the actor's entire instrument-the body, the voice, and the imagination. Training frees the actor, so that he/she is able to go with his instincts and impulses; out of the head and into the viscera. In scene study classes the student discovers the importance of text analysis and staying in the moment, and the need for selecting strong objectives, formidable obstacles, varied actions, and meaningful personalizations. The Alexander technique and teachings of Linklater is used in voice production. The movement component includes yoga, circus, and the teachings of Laban.    Angela Pietropinto, actor and teacher, as well as a Tisch alumnae and director of the studio, has assembled a faculty composed of master teachers, dedicated to teaching the creative process an actor must go through in order to become a conduit for a playwright's ideas. The studio's faculty members are working theater professionals as well as experienced teachers. The faculty exposes students to the ideas and philosophies of contemporary and classical playwrights.    The second half of the semester aims to integrate the movement, voice production, games/improvisation, scene study, and film production techniques and apply them to the students' scenes. The director and instructors collaborate to utilize all of the training to bring the dramatic and comic text to life.    Areas of Study:       Movement    Voice Production    Games/Improv    Clowning    Commedia Dell'Arte    Scene Study    Film Production    Students will attend the studio 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. three days a week. The other days are spent taking academic courses. On the last day of class there is an informal presentation of the scenes students have been working on. Movement pieces created under the guidance of the movement teacher are also presented.
