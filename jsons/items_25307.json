Duncan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Population Health at New York University School of Medicine, where he directs the Spatial Epidemiology Lab. He is a Faculty Affiliate at NYU's Global Institute of Public Health, NYU's Population Center, NYU\u2019s Center for Data Science, NYU's Center for Health, Identity, Behavior and Prevention Studies, NYU's Center for Drug Use and HIV Research and NYU's Broome Street Residential College. Dr. Duncan is a Social and Spatial Epidemiologist, studying how neighborhood characteristics (such as the built environment [including parks, community design features and tobacco retailers] and the social environment [including crime, violence and collective efficacy]) influence population health (especially cardiovascular disease, drug abuse and HIV prevention). He has a special emphasis on minority health and health disparities. Dr. Duncan also studies socio-demographic disparities in neighborhood environmental features related to population health and community wellbeing. His research has a strong domestic (U.S.) focus, but recent work is beginning to span across the globe. Methodologically, his research utilizes a geospatial lens to apply spatially explicit approaches such as computer-based geographic information systems, web-based geospatial technologies, real-time geospatial technologies and geospatial modeling techniques. For instance, his work applies emerging geospatial technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS) devices and smartphones in part to examine social networks in neighborhoods. Dr. Duncan's work appears in leading public health, medical, geography, criminology and demography journals. He has over 40 publications and book chapters. Dr. Duncan's recent work has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Verizon Foundation and the Aetna Foundation. He is an Associate Editor at Behavioral Medicine and on the Editorial Board of Spatial Demography. Dr. Duncan completed his doctorate and the Alonzo Smythe Yerby Postdoctoral Fellowship, both in Social Epidemiology, at Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He joined the faculty at NYU in 2013.

Duncan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Population Health at New York University School of Medicine, where he directs the Spatial Epidemiology Lab. He is a Faculty Affiliate at NYU's Global Institute of Public Health, NYU's Population Center, NYU\u2019s Center for Data Science, NYU's Center for Health, Identity, Behavior and Prevention Studies, NYU's Center for Drug Use and HIV Research and NYU's Broome Street Residential College. Dr. Duncan is a Social and Spatial Epidemiologist, studying how neighborhood characteristics (such as the built environment [including parks, community design features and tobacco retailers] and the social environment [including crime, violence and collective efficacy]) influence population health (especially cardiovascular disease, drug abuse and HIV prevention). He has a special emphasis on minority health and health disparities. Dr. Duncan also studies socio-demographic disparities in neighborhood environmental features related to population health and community wellbeing. His research has a strong domestic (U.S.) focus, but recent work is beginning to span across the globe. Methodologically, his research utilizes a geospatial lens to apply spatially explicit approaches such as computer-based geographic information systems, web-based geospatial technologies, real-time geospatial technologies and geospatial modeling techniques. For instance, his work applies emerging geospatial technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS) devices and smartphones in part to examine social networks in neighborhoods. Dr. Duncan's work appears in leading public health, medical, geography, criminology and demography journals. He has over 40 publications and book chapters. Dr. Duncan's recent work has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Verizon Foundation and the Aetna Foundation. He is an Associate Editor at Behavioral Medicine and on the Editorial Board of Spatial Demography. Dr. Duncan completed his doctorate and the Alonzo Smythe Yerby Postdoctoral Fellowship, both in Social Epidemiology, at Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He joined the faculty at NYU in 2013.
