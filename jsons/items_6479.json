The concept of utopia now carries both meanings and embodies the logical and ethical tensions that plague metaphorical (and sometimes geographical) borderlands between the ideal and the real. In the 20th century authors and theorists began to seriously weigh the benefits and dangers of utopian thought, as feminists, Marxists, environmentalists, and cosmopolitans continued to imagine new and complex utopias. In this course, we will examine the long tradition of utopian writing and thinking, analyzing its aesthetics and logic, uncovering and assessing its recurring themes and assumptions, and evaluating its utility and ethics. Students will write and revise four essays, each of which emphasizes a particular analytic strategy. Readings may include work by Plato, Augustine of Hippo, Thomas More, Edward Bellamy, Ernest Callenbach, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Frederic Jameson, Karl Popper, Krishan Kumar, B.F.

Instead of Eutopia, which means \u2018happy place,\u2019 More ironically named his imaginary island Utopia, which means simply \u2018no place.\u2019 The concept of utopia now carries both meanings and embodies the logical and ethical tensions that plague metaphorical (and sometimes geographical) borderlands between the ideal and the real. Associated with a diverse range of written genres from political philosophy to fiction, the name &quot;utopia&quot; is applied to real world communities, both secular and religious. Utopias are examined and challenged by critical theorists, and contemporary feminists, Marxists, environmentalists, and cosmopolitans continue to imagine new and complex utopias. In this course we will explore some of the following questions through a variety of texts and modes of textual analysis: Where did the notion of utopia come from and where is it going? What is the relationship between utopia and dystopia? Might it be dangerous to imagine and desire a utopia? What does the utopia one imagines say about who one is and the world one lives in? Students will write and revise three essays and a literary-critical essay. Readings may include work by Plato, Thomas More, H.G. Wells, George Orwell, Edward Bellamy, Ernest Callenbach, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Richard Rorty, Charles Nordoff, Frederic Jameson, and Krishan Kumar.

Description       In the sixteenth century, Thomas More, inspired by Plato\u2019s\u00a0 Republic, \u00a0imagined his own ideal state. Instead of\u00a0 Eutopia, \u00a0which means \u2018happy place,\u2019 More ironically named his imaginary island\u00a0 Utopia \u00a0, which means simply \u2018no place.\u2019 More\u2019s influential book eventually lent its name to a diverse set of texts and visions. The concept of utopia now carries both meanings and embodies the logical and ethical tensions that plague metaphorical (and sometimes geographical) borderlands between the ideal and the real. In the 20th century authors and theorists began to seriously weigh the benefits and dangers of utopian thought, as feminists, Marxists, environmentalists, and cosmopolitans continued to imagine new and complex utopias. In this course, we will examine the long tradition of utopian writing and thinking, analyzing its aesthetics and logic, uncovering and assessing its recurring themes and assumptions, and evaluating its utility and ethics. Students will write and revise four essays, each of which emphasizes a particular analytic strategy. Readings may include work by Plato, Augustine of Hippo, Thomas More, Edward Bellamy, Ernest Callenbach, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Frederic Jameson, Karl Popper, Krishan Kumar, B.F. Skinner, and George Orwell.

Associated with a diverse range of written genres from political philosophy to fiction, the name &quot;utopia&quot; is applied to real world communities, both secular and religious. Utopias are examined and challenged by critical theorists, and contemporary feminists, Marxists, environmentalists, and cosmopolitans continue to imagine new and complex utopias. In this course we will explore some of the following questions through a variety of texts and modes of textual analysis: Where did the notion of utopia come from and where is it going? What is the relationship between utopia and dystopia? Might it be dangerous to imagine and desire a utopia? What does the utopia one imagines say about who one is and the world one lives in? Students will write and revise three essays and a literary-critical essay. Readings may include work by Plato, Thomas More, H.G. Wells, George Orwell, Edward Bellamy, Ernest Callenbach, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Richard Rorty, Charles Nordoff, Frederic Jameson, and Krishan Kumar.
