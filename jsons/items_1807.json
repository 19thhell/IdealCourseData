One can encounter this past not just in the city's many museums and in the memories of its inhabitants, but also in its architecture: the palaces of the baroque, rococo and romantic periods, the monumental government buildings and workers' tenements of the Wilhelminian Empire, the modernist structures of the Weimar Republic, the massive ministries and Olympic Stadium of the Third Reich, ruins from World War II, the showcase developments-and the Wall-constructed during the Cold War.   Today, Berlin is at a particularly exciting moment of transition, reclaiming its historical role as Germany's capital and as the political, cultural, and economic intermediary between Eastern and Western Europe. Massive construction projects reflect this development and offer some of the most exciting new architecture in the world. Berlin is a thoroughly modern but affordable city with outstanding museums and a lively theatre and music scene; it also has an efficient public transportation system, an international cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife.            ACADEMICS      The academic program, built around Berlin's rich culture, immerses students in the life and language of the city. For those interested in language study, Summer in Berlin offers German courses at all levels of instruction, based on sufficient enrollment per course. In addition, content courses provide students with the option of exploring through walking tours and site trips both the historical past and exciting present of Germany\u2019s capital, of delving into the city\u2019s exciting interwar art scene, or of gaining a uniquely German perspective on terrorism.   Study of German language is recommended, but not required. Students can choose to take two content courses taught in English. An Independent Study course permits students, if they so desire, to engage in a research project or learning experience of their own design.                HOUSING &amp; MEALS     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Housing is located in NYU\u2019s newly opened residence in Kreuzberg, just around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie in an emerging art scene neighborhood studded with galleries. The NYU in Berlin academic center in the KulturBrauerei is a converted former brewery complex in the district of Prenzlauer Berg. It is a multi-story building featuring classrooms, offices, art studio space, a lounge and a computer lab.            EXCURSIONS     Aside from excursions in and around the city of Berlin, students will take a day trip to Weimar and Leipzig, and a weekend trip to Prague. In Prague, students will explore the traces of three cultures-Czech, German, and Jewish-on a three-day weekend.             Courses     All students must register for 8 points.

One can encounter this past not just in the city's many museums and in the memories of its inhabitants, but also in its architecture: the palaces of the baroque, rococo and romantic periods, the monumental government buildings and workers' tenements of the Wilhelminian Empire, the modernist structures of the Weimar Republic, the massive ministries and Olympic Stadium of the Third Reich, ruins from World War II, the showcase developments-and the Wall-constructed during the Cold War.   Today, Berlin is at a particularly exciting moment of transition, reclaiming its historical role as Germany's capital and as the political, cultural, and economic intermediary between Eastern and Western Europe. Massive construction projects reflect this development and offer some of the most exciting new architecture in the world. Berlin is a thoroughly modern but affordable city with outstanding museums and a lively theatre and music scene; it also has an efficient public transportation system, an international cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife.            ACADEMICS      The academic program, built around Berlin's rich culture, immerses students in the life and language of the city. For those interested in language study, Summer in Berlin offers German courses at all levels of instruction, based on sufficient enrollment per course. In addition, content courses provide students with the option of exploring through walking tours and site trips both the historical past and exciting present of Germany\u2019s capital, of delving into the city\u2019s exciting interwar art scene, or of gaining a uniquely German perspective on terrorism.   Study of German language is recommended, but not required. Students can choose to take two content courses taught in English. An Independent Study course permits students, if they so desire, to engage in a research project or learning experience of their own design.                HOUSING &amp; MEALS     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Housing is located in NYU\u2019s newly opened residence in Kreuzberg, just around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie in an emerging art scene neighborhood studded with galleries. The NYU in Berlin academic center in the KulturBrauerei is a converted former brewery complex in the district of Prenzlauer Berg. It is a multi-story building featuring classrooms, offices, art studio space, a lounge and a computer lab.            EXCURSIONS     Aside from excursions in and around the city of Berlin, students will take a day trip to Weimar and Leipzig, and a weekend trip to Prague. In Prague, students will explore the traces of three cultures-Czech, German, and Jewish-on a three-day weekend.             Courses     All students must register for 8 points.
