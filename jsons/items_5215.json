Over the past several years, biology has been revolutionized with the development of powerful techniques in molecular and cellular biology, genomics and bioinformatics that are now being applied to research across the spectrum of the science, from genetics and development to biomedicine, field studies and animal behavior. The department\u2019s programs of study and research reflect this contemporary view of biology.    The department offers students the opportunity to explore the various areas of current biology in an integrated yet diverse program that builds from a solid foundation of the basic elements of molecular and cellular biology, genetics, evolution, organ systems and population studies. Students are exposed to modern concepts, state-of-the-art approaches and current methods of experimentation in molecular biology, biochemistry, genomics and bioinformatics within introductory courses taken at the very outset of their studies. A variety of intermediate courses then provides in-depth exploration of major fields of biology. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses, which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research.    Three options are available to students pursuing a major in Biology. The standard Biology track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the laboratory, quantitative and reasoning skills needed for today\u2019s modern biology. The Ecology track also provides students with the broad background in modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches and analytical methods. The Global Public Health/Science major with Concentration in Biology provides students with strong foundations in biological science and global public health, with a focus on one of three emphasis areas: genetics and genomics, infectious diseases or environmental health.    The department also offers a series of discrete minors in the life sciences , specifically in the areas of:      Molecular and Cell Biology    Genetics    Genomics and Bioinformatics    Environmental Biology          Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique academic and career goals.    The Biology majors and minors provide outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable careers in the biomedical sciences.    Other courses offered by the department are designed to acquaint nonscience majors with contemporary issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology.    Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships and other enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in undergraduate research projects in faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These include the undergraduate Molecular Biology Laboratory, the Microscope Facility, the Genomics Core Facility and the Tissue Culture Facility. Field studies are carried out at many regional sites. Department faculty are also affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, the NYU Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences, the NYU School of Medicine, the NYU David B.

Students with questions about majoring in biology or minoring in a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of Biology. Those declaring a major in biology should complete a department declaration form. They are assigned a faculty adviser from the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study, determine course selections and discuss career goals.

Students with questions about majoring in Biology or minoring in  a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of  Biology. Those declaring a major in Biology are assigned a faculty adviser from  the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study,  determine course selections, and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is  also available to provide guidance concerning the many options and  opportunities afforded by the department for curricular enhancement, including  research experiences.      Major (Bachelor of Arts)      The Department offers two tracks. The standard biology  track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the  laboratory, quantitative and reasoning skills needed for today\u2019s modern  biology. The ecology track also provides students with the broad background in  modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches and  analytical methods.      In addition, students may pursue a major in Global Public  Health/Science, with a concentration in Biology (see below).      The following sixteen courses (typically 70 points) completed  with grades of C or higher (and a minimum GPA of 2.0 for all courses required  by and taken as electives in the major) are required for the major.      To permit the maximal choice of appropriate upper-level  courses, we strongly recommend that students take Principles of Biology I and   II (BIOL-UA 11, 12), General Chemistry I and II and Laboratories   (CHEM-UA 125, 126), and mathematics in their freshman year. Then as sophomores,  students in the standard track should take Molecular and Cell Biology   (BIOL-UA 21, 22), whereas students in the ecology track should take Fundamentals  of Ecology (BIOL-UA 63).      Programs of majors must be approved each term by a department  adviser.          Biology standard track      Biology Core Courses (four  courses/16 points)      Principles of Biology I: One of the following: Principles  of Biology I (BIOL-UA 11) or Principles of Biology I in London   (BIOL-UA 9011)      Principles of Biology II: One of the  following: Principles of Biology II (BIOL-UA 12) or Principles of  Biology II in London (BIOL-UA 9012)      NOTE: Biology majors are not required to register into the  1-credit Principles of Biology Lab (BIOL-UA 123).      Molecular and Cell Biology: Molecular and Cell  Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 21, 22).
