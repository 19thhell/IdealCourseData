ATISA encourages, supports, and furthers the study of translation and interpreting by disseminating knowledge and research relevant to all areas of language mediation, regardless of discipline. Translation and interpreting studies explores all forms of communication between languages, including translation, interpreting, localization, bilingual text revision, cross-cultural communication, and the various specializations, tools, and technologies involved in such activities. Presentations focusing on the act of communicating between human languages from a wide range of disciplines and methodologies, including translation studies, interpreting studies, transfer studies, applied linguistics, cognitive science, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, education, and other social sciences, were welcomed. Presentations followed the standards of scholarship of their respective disciplines and showed the connection of their work to translation and interpreting studies.   ATISA VII was co-sponsored by the NYU Office of the Provost, the Dean of the NYU College of Arts and Science, and the Dean of the NYU School of Professional Studies.

ATISA encourages, supports, and furthers the study of translation and interpreting by disseminating knowledge and research relevant to all areas of language mediation, regardless of discipline. Translation and interpreting studies explores all forms of communication between languages, including translation, interpreting, localization, bilingual text revision, cross-cultural communication, and the various specializations, tools, and technologies involved in such activities. Presentations focusing on the act of communicating between human languages from a wide range of disciplines and methodologies, including translation studies, interpreting studies, transfer studies, applied linguistics, cognitive science, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, education, and other social sciences, were welcomed. Presentations followed the standards of scholarship of their respective disciplines and showed the connection of their work to translation and interpreting studies.   ATISA VII was co-sponsored by the NYU Office of the Provost, the Dean of the NYU College of Arts and Science, and the Dean of the NYU School of Professional Studies.

Course offerings are organized into three groups, by language concentration: language and translation theory; subject matter background; and translation, with both required and elective courses that must be taken from each group. While it is not compulsory to choose a specific concentration area, the balance of required and elective courses allow you the option to focus more on one area over another. The curriculum is regularly evaluated and updated to ensure that students learn at the leading edge of this field.   The curriculum is organized by language concentration.
