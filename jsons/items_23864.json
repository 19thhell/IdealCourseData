Currently, more than 40 million people in the US have some type of speech, language, or hearing impairment, resulting from brain trauma, neurological diseases, Autism Spectrum Disorder, developmental delay, and cleft palate, among others.    Communicative sciences and disorders is a field dedicated to the science behind how we communicate. This interdisciplinary field draws on the domains of linguistics, psychology, and physiology to understand normal communication processes, as well as the nature of communication disorders and their effects on an individual across the lifespan. Those involved in the field seek to lessen the impact of speech, language, hearing, and swallowing disorders on a person's life.    What you'll learn    This undergraduate program integrates liberal arts courses in social and physical sciences, humanities, writing, foreign languages, and math, with theoretical and hands-on aspects of communicative sciences and disorders to understand how and why we communicate, and if necessary, how to intervene in both the young and old.    The program also includes elective credits that students may use to pursue a minor , which commonly is in linguistics, foreign language (including American Sign Language), psychology, nutrition, or education.

Currently, more than 40 million people in the US have some type of speech, language, or hearing impairment, resulting from brain trauma, neurological diseases, Autism Spectrum Disorder, developmental delay, and cleft palate, among others.    Communicative sciences and disorders is a field dedicated to the science behind how we communicate. This interdisciplinary field draws on the domains of linguistics, psychology, and physiology to understand normal communication processes, as well as the nature of communication disorders and their effects on an individual across the lifespan. Those involved in the field seek to lessen the impact of speech, language, hearing, and swallowing disorders on a person's life.    What you'll learn    This undergraduate program integrates liberal arts courses in social and physical sciences, humanities, writing, foreign languages, and math, with theoretical and hands-on aspects of communicative sciences and disorders to understand how and why we communicate, and if necessary, how to intervene in both the young and old.    The program also includes elective credits that students may use to pursue a minor , which commonly is in linguistics, foreign language (including American Sign Language), psychology, nutrition, or education.    See the curriculum and degree requirements .    Find out more on how to apply .    Why NYU?       You have the opportunity to get involved in a lab with one of our active research faculty members .

Currently, more than 40 million people in the US have some type of speech, language, or hearing impairment, resulting from brain trauma, neurological diseases, Autism Spectrum Disorder, developmental delay, and cleft palate, among others.    Communicative sciences and disorders is a field dedicated to the science behind how we communicate. This interdisciplinary field draws on the domains of linguistics, psychology, and physiology to understand normal communication processes, as well as the nature of communication disorders and their effects on an individual across the lifespan. Those involved in the field seek to lessen the impact of speech, language, hearing, and swallowing disorders on a person's life.    What you'll learn    This undergraduate program integrates liberal arts courses in social and physical sciences, humanities, writing, foreign languages, and math, with theoretical and hands-on aspects of communicative sciences and disorders to understand how and why we communicate, and if necessary, how to intervene in both the young and old.    The program also includes elective credits that students may use to pursue a minor , which commonly is in linguistics, foreign language (including American Sign Language), psychology, nutrition, or education.
