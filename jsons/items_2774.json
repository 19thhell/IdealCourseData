Hide biography.      Sandra Shapshay is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Indiana University.

Levinson, ed. Suffering Art Gladly. She has also investigated Schopenhauer\u2019s theory of freedom in a paper co-authored with Alex Neill and published in the International Yearbook of German Idealism . Currently, Shapshay is working on a book provisionally titled Degrees of Inherent Value: Schopenhauer\u2019s Ethical Thought that reconstructs Schopenhauer\u2019s ethics of compassion and argues that it offers a hybrid Kantian-Moral Sense theory of ethics that promises to interject a novel, less-anthropocentric option into the ethical-theoretical landscape.

Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them , schools around the world began the process of exposing global issues to middle and high school students, calling on them to push forward solutions thereto.   Five years after the Global Issues Network's inception, NYU Abu Dhabi took the platform to a new level in January 2013. For the first time, motivated college undergraduates and gifted high school students from all over the world were invited to the United Arab Emirates to participate in NYUAD's inaugural GIN2013 conference .     This Year's Conference   The GIN2014 conference at NYU Abu Dhabi is an international gathering of emerging leaders who share a passion and drive to create innovative solutions to some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues. GIN2014 challenges delegates to use six different regions of the world as case studies to develop distinct, sustainable action plans that address issues in the following areas:     Peacekeeping   Global Warming   Poverty   Education   Healthcare   Energy     GIN attracts some of the best and the brightest students from across the globe. Be ready to innovate, as our action plans can and will be implemented within a six-month time frame after the conference. In order to support the diversity and ideals of this three-day conference, we request each university send only a small delegation. Furthermore, NYU Abu Dhabi hopes to set a precedent through GIN by creating a format and structure that can be used around the world, whether in New York, Shanghai, London, Rio de Janeiro, Manila, or Los Angeles.     Delegates will be selected through an online application process, which is slated to go live within the next few months.

Currently, Shapshay is working on a book provisionally titled Degrees of Inherent Value: Schopenhauer\u2019s Ethical Thought that reconstructs Schopenhauer\u2019s ethics of compassion and argues that it offers a hybrid Kantian-Moral Sense theory of ethics that promises to interject a novel, less-anthropocentric option into the ethical-theoretical landscape.

Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them , schools around the world began the process of exposing global issues to middle and high school students, calling on them to push forward solutions thereto.   Five years after the Global Issues Network's inception, NYU Abu Dhabi took the platform to a new level in January 2013. For the first time, motivated college undergraduates and gifted high school students from all over the world were invited to the United Arab Emirates to participate in NYUAD's inaugural GIN2013 conference .     This Year's Conference   The GIN2014 conference at NYU Abu Dhabi is an international gathering of emerging leaders who share a passion and drive to create innovative solutions to some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues. GIN2014 challenges delegates to use six different regions of the world as case studies to develop distinct, sustainable action plans that address issues in the following areas:     Peacekeeping   Global Warming   Poverty   Education   Healthcare   Energy     GIN attracts some of the best and the brightest students from across the globe. Be ready to innovate, as our action plans can and will be implemented within a six-month time frame after the conference. In order to support the diversity and ideals of this three-day conference, we request each university send only a small delegation. Furthermore, NYU Abu Dhabi hopes to set a precedent through GIN by creating a format and structure that can be used around the world, whether in New York, Shanghai, London, Rio de Janeiro, Manila, or Los Angeles.     Delegates will be selected through an online application process, which is slated to go live within the next few months.
