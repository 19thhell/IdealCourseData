Beginning with an overview of the principles of inheritance such as cell division and Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse methods that scientists employ to study heredity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 306, Natural Science II: Brain and Behavio r Prof. Fenton (Neuroscience)  syllabus The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter behavior and brain function. Note: Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 310, Natural Science II: Molecules of Life Prof. Jordan (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availability of new pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that lower cholesterol to those that influence behavior. We examine the chemistry and biology of biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional structure that endows them with a specific function. This information provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding, molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug treatments. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 313, Natural Science II: The Brain \u2014 A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology)  syllabus A non-textbook introductory science course aimed at non-science students interested understanding and caring for their own brains. The course provides new ideas of brain evolution, drug action and mental disorders. Core neurobiological ideas are developed into complex topics such as addiction, violence, memory, homosexuality and obesity. Each lecture provides current insights confronting students. The important subjects of drugs and alcohol introduce current mechanism of action for abuse of illegal (e.g. marijuana and ecstasy) and prescription (e.g. Xanax, Oxycodone, and Adderall) drugs. The course ends with coverage of clinical topics such as depression, suicide, anxiety, autism and ADHD. A weekly laboratory is included in this class which consist of brain dissections, microscopy, and computer assisted morphometry as well as exercises to cover topics such as alcohol measurement, calorie determination, photosynthesis and gender differences. Students are also expected to learn to use DSM-5 psychiatric handbook. The course grade is based on 5 test, a final, laboratory grade and two papers. The course is not recommended for juniors or seniors. All lectures are available as PowerPoint presentations before class and students are encouraged to use their computers or smartphones during class to facilitate discussions and questions. In summary, this class attempts to provide college students with the background to understand how the brain is structured and how it functions.  Note: Handling of animal brain tissue is required in some labs. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 315, Natural Science II: Human Reproduction Prof. Naftolin (NYU Medical School)  syllabus Reproduction is a major presence in daily life. This introductory course covers the basic development, anatomy and function of the reproductive systems in men and women, including the human sexual response and the sexual development of differences in the brain. The course also includes special topics such as sexually transmitted diseases, family planning, in vitro fertilization, and reproductive ethics. We will examine the relationships between reproduction and societal, medical and global issues. The laboratory provides hands-on experience with fundamental processes in reproduction. NOTES: 1. The laboratory sections for this course will be located at 180 Varick Street . 2. Some laboratories require animal dissection and/or handling live animals.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 305, Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Disotell (Anthropology)  syllabus This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of biological anthropology and explores the evolutionary history of our lineage. Topics include but are not limited to human and non-human primate genetics, behavior, osteology, paleoanthropology, bioarchaeology, and forensics. Particular emphases are placed on modern human biological variation and the human fossil record. In doing so, we will reconstruct the behavior\u2014locomotor, social, sexual, and cultural\u2014of our ancestors and close relatives using modern analogs including modern humans, our closest living relatives the great apes, and other primates and non-primate animals. This course begins with a review of cellular and molecular biology and evolutionary theory in general, then establishes our place in nature and geological time, and ends with a detailed foray into modern human origins, including fossils, artifacts, and inferred cultural behaviors. Additionally, we will explore modern human variation, including discussions of topics such as race, genetics, and sexuality. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 306, Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. Kiorpes (Neuroscience)  syllabus The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the brain's plasticity.

We conclude with a study of molecular genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug treatments. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 312, Natural Science II: Earth, Life, &amp; Time Prof. Rampino (Biology)  syllabus Over the last four billion years, life on Earth has evolved in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, major innovations in the history of life have led to transformations of the Earth's physical environment. We examine the history of the intimate relationship between the Earth's changing environment and the evolution of life on the planet. This long-term historical perspective provides a context for understanding current environmental issues such as global warming, tropical deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 314 Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity Prof. Siegal (Biology)  syllabus Millions of species of animals, plants and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.

Note: Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs. FALL 2012 MAP-UA 309 Natural Science II: The Body - How It Works Prof. Petersen (Chemistry) syllabus The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems. FALL 2012 MAP-UA 313 Natural Science II: The Brain: A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology) syllabus** The Human Brain is the most complex organ. Despite the central position it has in nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it remains to many a mystery. How does it work? How can we care for it? How long will it function? This MAP course is designed to provide answers to these questions, and many more at an academic level accessible to the non-scientist student, and of interest to the scientist with little exposure to neuroscience. The aims of the course are to provide the student with a firm foundation in what the brain looks like and what each of the parts do. To accomplish this, we will learn about the functions of the cortex in higher learning and memory, as well as discuss the basic work of the brainstem in regulating the internal environment of the body. The importance of nutrition on neurotransmitter synthesis, the function of sleep on memory and why we need so much of it, and the effects of alcohol and drugs on brain harmony and the meaning of addiction will be some of the points covered in this course. We will look at brain development and the special needs of children, as well as brain aging and illness and the difficulty of helping. The laboratories are designed to provide hands-on experience in exploring the structure of the brain as well as learning how to measure brain functioning. We will provide specially prepared slides so the student can recognize a neuron and differentiate a dendrite from an axon. The molecular shape of neurotransmitter will be covered, as well as learning how to measure alcohol and determining its levels in your body. It is expected that by the end of the course, the student will be familiar with the biological basis of brain structure and function, and not only be able to detect how a normal brain works, but also how to help keep it healthy. SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 305 Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Anton (Anthropology) An introduction to the approaches and methods scientists use to investigate the origins and evolutionary history of our own species. This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans, the Neandertal enigma, the importance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the 6-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution. SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. Suzuki (Neural Science) This class will explore the relationship between brain and behavior from a neuroscience perspective which describes processes in the brain in terms of the molecules, cells, neurochemicals and network activity that underlie them. The class starts with a discussion of neurons and glia, the two basic building blocks of the brain,and how electrical and chemical signals allow these elements to communicate with each other. Using this knowledge as a foundation, we then explore the workings of the major brain systems that allow us to interact with the world around us, such as the sensory systems that allow us to see hear, feel, smell and taste. Next,we explore the brain\u2019s motor/movement systems. The last section of the class focuses on the so-called higher cognitive functions, which include learning, memory, emotion, cognitive control and language. These latter systems are critical for our individual personalities and creativity. The goal of this course is not only to give students a factual foundation of our current understanding of the brain basis of behavior, but also toprovide students an understanding of how neuroscientists working today use a combination of scientific inquiry together with cutting edge technology to understand the inner workings of the human brain. Note: Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs.

SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology)  syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.

Beginning with an overview of the principles of inheritance such as cell division and Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse methods that scientists employ to study heredity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 306, Natural Science II: Brain and Behavio r Prof. Fenton (Neuroscience)  syllabus The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter behavior and brain function. Note: Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 310, Natural Science II: Molecules of Life Prof. Jordan (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availability of new pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that lower cholesterol to those that influence behavior. We examine the chemistry and biology of biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional structure that endows them with a specific function. This information provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding, molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug treatments. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 313, Natural Science II: The Brain \u2014 A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology)  syllabus A non-textbook introductory science course aimed at non-science students interested understanding and caring for their own brains. The course provides new ideas of brain evolution, drug action and mental disorders. Core neurobiological ideas are developed into complex topics such as addiction, violence, memory, homosexuality and obesity. Each lecture provides current insights confronting students. The important subjects of drugs and alcohol introduce current mechanism of action for abuse of illegal (e.g. marijuana and ecstasy) and prescription (e.g. Xanax, Oxycodone, and Adderall) drugs. The course ends with coverage of clinical topics such as depression, suicide, anxiety, autism and ADHD. A weekly laboratory is included in this class which consist of brain dissections, microscopy, and computer assisted morphometry as well as exercises to cover topics such as alcohol measurement, calorie determination, photosynthesis and gender differences. Students are also expected to learn to use DSM-5 psychiatric handbook. The course grade is based on 5 test, a final, laboratory grade and two papers. The course is not recommended for juniors or seniors. All lectures are available as PowerPoint presentations before class and students are encouraged to use their computers or smartphones during class to facilitate discussions and questions. In summary, this class attempts to provide college students with the background to understand how the brain is structured and how it functions.  Note: Handling of animal brain tissue is required in some labs. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 315, Natural Science II: Human Reproduction Prof. Naftolin (NYU Medical School)  syllabus Reproduction is a major presence in daily life. This introductory course covers the basic development, anatomy and function of the reproductive systems in men and women, including the human sexual response and the sexual development of differences in the brain. The course also includes special topics such as sexually transmitted diseases, family planning, in vitro fertilization, and reproductive ethics. We will examine the relationships between reproduction and societal, medical and global issues. The laboratory provides hands-on experience with fundamental processes in reproduction. NOTES: 1. The laboratory sections for this course will be located at 180 Varick Street . 2. Some laboratories require animal dissection and/or handling live animals.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 305, Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Disotell (Anthropology)  syllabus This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of biological anthropology and explores the evolutionary history of our lineage. Topics include but are not limited to human and non-human primate genetics, behavior, osteology, paleoanthropology, bioarchaeology, and forensics. Particular emphases are placed on modern human biological variation and the human fossil record. In doing so, we will reconstruct the behavior\u2014locomotor, social, sexual, and cultural\u2014of our ancestors and close relatives using modern analogs including modern humans, our closest living relatives the great apes, and other primates and non-primate animals. This course begins with a review of cellular and molecular biology and evolutionary theory in general, then establishes our place in nature and geological time, and ends with a detailed foray into modern human origins, including fossils, artifacts, and inferred cultural behaviors. Additionally, we will explore modern human variation, including discussions of topics such as race, genetics, and sexuality. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 306, Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. Kiorpes (Neuroscience)  syllabus The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior.

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 312, Natural Science II: Earth, Life, &amp; Time Prof. Rampino (Biology)  syllabus Over the last four billion years, life on Earth has evolved in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, major innovations in the history of life have led to transformations of the Earth's physical environment. We examine the history of the intimate relationship between the Earth's changing environment and the evolution of life on the planet. This long-term historical perspective provides a context for understanding current environmental issues such as global warming, tropical deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 314 Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity Prof. Siegal (Biology)  syllabus Millions of species of animals, plants and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.

FALL 2012 MAP-UA 309 Natural Science II: The Body - How It Works Prof. Petersen (Chemistry) syllabus The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems. FALL 2012 MAP-UA 313 Natural Science II: The Brain: A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology) syllabus** The Human Brain is the most complex organ. Despite the central position it has in nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it remains to many a mystery. How does it work? How can we care for it? How long will it function? This MAP course is designed to provide answers to these questions, and many more at an academic level accessible to the non-scientist student, and of interest to the scientist with little exposure to neuroscience. The aims of the course are to provide the student with a firm foundation in what the brain looks like and what each of the parts do. To accomplish this, we will learn about the functions of the cortex in higher learning and memory, as well as discuss the basic work of the brainstem in regulating the internal environment of the body. The importance of nutrition on neurotransmitter synthesis, the function of sleep on memory and why we need so much of it, and the effects of alcohol and drugs on brain harmony and the meaning of addiction will be some of the points covered in this course. We will look at brain development and the special needs of children, as well as brain aging and illness and the difficulty of helping. The laboratories are designed to provide hands-on experience in exploring the structure of the brain as well as learning how to measure brain functioning. We will provide specially prepared slides so the student can recognize a neuron and differentiate a dendrite from an axon. The molecular shape of neurotransmitter will be covered, as well as learning how to measure alcohol and determining its levels in your body. It is expected that by the end of the course, the student will be familiar with the biological basis of brain structure and function, and not only be able to detect how a normal brain works, but also how to help keep it healthy. SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 305 Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Anton (Anthropology) An introduction to the approaches and methods scientists use to investigate the origins and evolutionary history of our own species. This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans, the Neandertal enigma, the importance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the 6-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution. SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. Suzuki (Neural Science) This class will explore the relationship between brain and behavior from a neuroscience perspective which describes processes in the brain in terms of the molecules, cells, neurochemicals and network activity that underlie them. The class starts with a discussion of neurons and glia, the two basic building blocks of the brain,and how electrical and chemical signals allow these elements to communicate with each other. Using this knowledge as a foundation, we then explore the workings of the major brain systems that allow us to interact with the world around us, such as the sensory systems that allow us to see hear, feel, smell and taste. Next,we explore the brain\u2019s motor/movement systems. The last section of the class focuses on the so-called higher cognitive functions, which include learning, memory, emotion, cognitive control and language. These latter systems are critical for our individual personalities and creativity. The goal of this course is not only to give students a factual foundation of our current understanding of the brain basis of behavior, but also toprovide students an understanding of how neuroscientists working today use a combination of scientific inquiry together with cutting edge technology to understand the inner workings of the human brain.

SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology)  syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.
