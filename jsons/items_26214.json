Center-based child care programs often provide a full day of care, generally from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Part-day and school day programs, often referred to as nursery schools, are also available.   Ages Served     Early childhood centers in NYC can care for children as young as 8 weeks however it is more common that a child care program programs education and care for children beginning at 2 years 9 months. Some centers offer services to school-age children as well.   Hours Served     Center-based programs providing a full day of care are generally in operation from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Some programs offer parents other scheduling options including: part-time, full day/part week, part day/full week, or part day/part week.   Average Cost     The average cost for full time care in NYC ranges from $1,300-$2,500/month.

In New York City and elsewhere group child care services are a licensed form of care. The following is a summary of key regulations in NYC.

Center-based child care programs often provide a full day of care, generally from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Part-day and school day programs, often referred to as nursery schools, are also available.   Ages Served     Early childhood centers in NYC can care for children as young as 8 weeks however it is more common that a child care program programs education and care for children beginning at 2 years 9 months. Some centers offer services to school-age children as well.   Hours Served     Center-based programs providing a full day of care are generally in operation from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Some programs offer parents other scheduling options including: part-time, full day/part week, part day/full week, or part day/part week.   Average Cost     The average cost for full time care in NYC ranges from $1,300-$2,500/month. Centers typically charge more for younger children because they require more care and attention (diaper changes, feeding help, etc.). Costs for infant and toddler care averages $1,800/month in NYC.
