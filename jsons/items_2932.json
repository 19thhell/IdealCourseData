Afrobarometer surveys are conducted in more that a dozen African countries and are repeated on a regular cycle. Because the instrument asks a standard set of questions, countries can be systematically compared. Trends in public attitudes are tracked over time. Results are shared with decision makers, policy advocates, civic educators, journalists, researchers, donors and investors, as well as average Africans who wish to become more informed and active citizens.

Africa Past and Present: Podcasts on African history, culture, politics       Africa Past and Present is a series of podcasts about history, culture, and politics in Africa and the diaspora. They highlight interesting and significant people, ideas, and discussions in African Studies from a wide range of disciplines and perspectives. Their mission is to broaden the availability and accessibility of cutting-edge knowledge relating to African experiences and to do so in a down-to-earth and informed manner. Shows feature interviews with eminent scholars and persons, commentary on current events, and issues and debates of relevance to Africans at home and abroad.              Web Resources for African Languages     There are anywhere between 1,500 and 2,000 languages in Africa, most of which are still poorly documented. While much linguistic field work is being carried out in Africa, and thus also many publications do see the light of day, access to descriptive materials is in general hard to come by and often fragmentary. These webpages aim to simplify the finding of linguistic Africana on the net. The main purpose of these pages is to offer easy access to online materials dealing with African languages. These pages contain links to other sites hosting free stuff, be they downloadable files (of any format), web-readable texts, searchable databases, or whatever. Particular attention is given to materials that contain structural/descriptive data, though not exclusively so. Links to commercial enterprises won't be added, as a rule.     Chichewa Dictionary Project    The Dictionary has more than 40,000 entries from English into Chichewa and the other way round. Free acces to the online Dictionary is offered to everyone, though limited to 10 searches per day and to the first lines of an entry.
