Here scholars from across the academic spectrum unite to understand how we make decisions with an aim towards treating pathology, understanding consumer behavior and developing better public policies. Uniting neurobiologists who study the biological basis of decision making with the study of urban informatics, business, finance, marketing, addiction, obesity, medical pathology \u2013 and focusing on NYU\u2019s home cities of New York and Shanghai \u2013 the IISDM defines a fundamentally new approach to the study of all kinds of decision making.   Read More Read More   Decades ago, scholars of human decision-making with a bent toward policy were economists. Trained in econometrics, those social scientists used sophisticated mathematical tools to connect macro-scale measures of our societies to the social policies meant to improve our welfare. In the late 1970s and early 1980s a group of pioneering psychologists, led by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, began to develop a richer academic notion of decision-making that reached down from economics to psychology for novel insights. Thirty years later, those insights, which began the \u201cbehavioral revolution,\u201d have become fundamental drivers in the world of policy. Fifteen years ago, a group of cognitive neuroscientists began to push down even further, exploring how the structural features of our nervous systems condition our behaviors and our choices. Today, the policy implications of those \u201cneuroeconomic\u201d insights are beginning to be explored as well. From each of those revolutions what emerged was both a more consilient view of human behavior and an aspiration to policy \u2013 an effort to shape our societies by using all that we know about how humans make decisions.   The IISDM takes that trend a step further by embracing a new and radically different opportunity. This opportunity allows researchers to reach upwards directly to the policy level, while at the same time testing what has been learned about the human decision-maker in an unprecedented way. Here at the IISDM we unify the study of decision making by bringing together scholars working in disciplines ranging from neuroeconomics to urban informatics.

Here scholars from across the academic spectrum unite to understand how we make decisions with an aim towards treating pathology, understanding consumer behavior and developing better public policies. Uniting neurobiologists who study the biological basis of decision making with the study of urban informatics, business, finance, marketing, addiction, obesity, medical pathology \u2013 and focusing on NYU\u2019s home cities of New York and Shanghai \u2013 the IISDM defines a fundamentally new approach to the study of all kinds of decision making.   Read More Read More   Decades ago, scholars of human decision-making with a bent toward policy were economists. Trained in econometrics, those social scientists used sophisticated mathematical tools to connect macro-scale measures of our societies to the social policies meant to improve our welfare. In the late 1970s and early 1980s a group of pioneering psychologists, led by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, began to develop a richer academic notion of decision-making that reached down from economics to psychology for novel insights. Thirty years later, those insights, which began the \u201cbehavioral revolution,\u201d have become fundamental drivers in the world of policy. Fifteen years ago, a group of cognitive neuroscientists began to push down even further, exploring how the structural features of our nervous systems condition our behaviors and our choices. Today, the policy implications of those \u201cneuroeconomic\u201d insights are beginning to be explored as well. From each of those revolutions what emerged was both a more consilient view of human behavior and an aspiration to policy \u2013 an effort to shape our societies by using all that we know about how humans make decisions.   The IISDM takes that trend a step further by embracing a new and radically different opportunity. This opportunity allows researchers to reach upwards directly to the policy level, while at the same time testing what has been learned about the human decision-maker in an unprecedented way. Here at the IISDM we unify the study of decision making by bringing together scholars working in disciplines ranging from neuroeconomics to urban informatics.

How do we make decisions, and what forces shape those decisions? How can we apply what we learn about human health and behavior to inform and improve public policy to make it more effective? The Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of Decision Making (IISDM) was formed to bring together different scientific disciplines\u2014including neuroscience, economics, psychology, and urban informatics\u2014to tackle the next generation of human behavior research challenges and translate that research into improved public policy. IISDM breaks down the barriers between these and other disciplines and integrates the insights from these seemingly disparate fields into the study of neuroeconomics: understanding how people make decisions. Combined with our partner institutions within NYU, IISDM is the premiere global research institution for neuroeconomics and human behavior.
