How do they attach meaning to spaces to create places? And how do the experiences of inhabiting, viewing, and hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performances, memories, and habits? Course themes include: mapping and the imagination; vision and space, soundscape, architecture and landscape, new media and space/time compression; space and identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1010 - Censorship in American Culture   An upper level course on the topic of censorship in American culture, from the late 19th century to the present. The broader context for our exploration will be the public sphere, understood in two ways: as the classic, liberal ideal-a space for civil, and equitable exchange of ideas and opinions open to all citizens-and in the more contemporary reality-a highly contested space of public discussion, where the boundaries concerning who can participate, what topics are allowed, and how the exchange takes place are drawn and redrawn. The tension between ideal and real forms of public communication plays out in highly charged debates around censorship, which take place in diverse public spaces, including literature, film, theatre, art galleries, the press, the internet, sidewalks, courts, and bars. Because these debates are cultural and legal ones, and are frequently deeply divisive within American society, the goal is for the students to have an enhanced understanding of the historical contexts in which important cultural and legal struggles over censorship took place, and to bring that understanding to bear on contemporary debates about the arts, sexuality, gender, privacy, national security, media technology, and government involvement in the marketplace of ideas and images.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1016 - Media Audiences   Communication scholars have long concerned themselves with the relationship between various media/technologies and &lsquo;the audience.&rsquo;  Different intentions and perspectives inform the discourse and research on how media and communication technologies and their audiences/users interact.  This course will proceed historically, theoretically, and methodologically, always questioning the construction of audiences and media users -- constructions that are shaped by commercial, academic, political and cultural contexts. Students will reflect on some historical analyses of &lsquo;emergent&rsquo; audiences and critical responses to institutional constructions of audiences.  Students will critique mass communication &lsquo;positivist&rsquo; studies and questions of &lsquo;media effects&rsquo; that dominated debates about audiences beginning in the early twentieth century and still continue today. In addition, students will examine how media and audiences are both situated in particular multiple contexts that have a bearing on how media are generated and circulated, and how audiences experience and make meaning of media/technologies. Methodologically, students will investigate how audiences are conceptualized and researched by scholars and cultural critics.  Throughout the course, students will explore the thinking and multiple contexts that frame various conceptualizations of media/technologies and audiences, and how these different approaches inform the concerns, questions, methods, findings, and implications of audience/user research .

MCC-UE 1025 - Race and Media   America&#39;s founding principles of equality and equal opportunity have long been the subject of interpretation, debate, national angst and widespread (often violent) conflict. No more is this the case than when we talk about the issue of race. While biological notions of race have lost their scientific validity, race remains a salient issue in American life as a social and political reality sustained through a wide variety of media forms. The broad purpose of this course is to better understand how notions of race have been defined and shaped in and through these mediated forms. Specific attention may be given to the ways that race is articulated in forms of mass media and popular culture.

These technological frameworks will be examined as the basic grammar of digital media and related to theories of identity, privacy, policy, and other pertinent themes.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1032 - Social Media Networking   This course will examine &ldquo;social media&rdquo; from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. We will work from an expansive definition of what constitutes &ldquo;social media,&rdquo; considering social network sites, smartphone apps, and online games, among other technologies. The course itself will involve communication in social media channels in addition to the traditional seminar format, thus we will be actively participating in the phenomena under study as we go.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1033 Critical Making (NEW for Spring 2015!)   Critical making is hands-on hardware practice as a form of reflection and analysis: a way of thinking through what (and how) computing and digital media mean by understanding how they work , building on the literature of media studies and the digital humanities . By turning from software to hardware, to the physicality of computation and communications infrastructure, we will take objects apart, literally and figuratively, and in the process will learn to interpret and to intervene -- using prototyping, reverse engineering, hardware hacking and circuit bending, design fiction, electronics fabrication and other approaches -- in the material layer of digital technologies.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1040 - Health Media and Communication   The meanings of health and disease are shaped not only by  scientific and medical discourses, but by media, communication, and the  cultures of health. This course examines  the impact of media and health cultures on what counts as normal and  pathological, how medical environments are understood and experienced, popular  tactics for communicating and contesting biomedical information, public  understandings of biotechnology, and how media representation and popular  culture help to shape understandings of disease and health. Through the topic  of health, we will look at nationhood and population management,  subject-formation and stigma, individual and environmental risk. At the level  of language, we will question the metaphoric uses of disease and their  consequences. Readings, films (and other sources) will be drawn from a variety  of genres, including epidemiology, public health, anthropology, history,  communication studies, and medical memoir.

Summer 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 Communication &amp; Persuasion - Film Classics of Propaganda Instructor: Terence Moran , Mon/Wed 5:10-8:10 PM    Topic: Communication and Persuasion: Film Classics of Propaganda   An examination of classics of film propaganda in terms of their ideologies and mythic structures and messages. We will examine three powerful ideologies of the 20 th Century via analyses of films that exemplify and promote the values and life styles of Communism in Battleship Potemkin (Soviet Union, 1925), Fascisim in Triumph des Willens (National Socialist Germany, 1934-35), and Capitalism in Sex and the City (United States, 2008). Our analyses of these films will be based upon selected readings in Jacques Ellul&rsquo;s Propaganda, The Formation of Men&rsquo;s Attitudes and Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s The Hero With a Thousand Faces with regard to propaganda and the myth of the hero. Background readings, class lectures, and models for analyzing communication and propaganda will be used to structure an environment in which our class will examine specific case studies involving films from American and foreign sources, and covering films from the silent era to the 21 st Century.    Fall 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 / Topic: The Raw Data of Intimate Life Instructor: Roger Friedland, Tuesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Social research tries to make sense of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo;, doubly so in this case as they refer to quantitative information about the sexual, romantic and religious lives of young people. This seminar seeks to teach students the basics of quantitative social research, a particular kind of sense-making that both makes and manipulates the data. This seminar will consider both the generation and testing of hypotheses using survey data on intimate life recently collected by the instructor through social network sites, the blogsphere and university course websites in the United States and Muslim-majority countries in the Near East. Students will learn to use STATA, a statistical software, in order to calculate distributions of values, cross-tabulations, and potentially regression analyses. Students will use these skills to develop and test their own hypothesis for the final paper for this seminar. Students need not have any previous statistical training. Note: This is not a course on social media; it uses social media to generate samples of media users for explanatory analysis.    MCC-UE 1200-002 / Topic: Black Lives Matter - Race, Media, and Social Movements Instructor: Nicholas Mirzoeff, Tuesdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This seminar concentrates on the use of media by and for the Black Lives Matter movement. We will historicise the movement by examining Reconstruction, Civil Rights and the Black Power movement. We will contextualize it by learning about the prison-industrial complex and the New Jim Crow. At the heart of our discussion will be media in and for the movement. We'll look at performative resistance like Hands Up, Don't Shoot; Die Ins; and Black Brunch; and the role of social media in shaping resistance. We will get to the heart of what happened in Ferguson by reading the grand jury depositions. We'll look at how #BlackLivesMatter has challenged art, cinema and museums. And we'll consider what actions to take next.    MCC-UE 1200-003 / Topic: Media Landscapes - \"The Wire\" Instructor: Arvind Rajagopal , Thursdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This course will investigate the landscapes brought into view by a specific media artifact, in this case the critically acclaimed HBO show, The Wire. The Wire&rsquo;s extraordinary success as a TV series about a &ldquo;black site&rdquo; stretched across the American heartland, namely the African American urban underclass, has been copiously studied and commented upon. It has been seen as an example of the critical and creative turn taken by a segment of the cultural industry, as a maturation of the audience and a de-massification of viewer tastes in the era of addressable mass culture. David Simon himself, among others, has also described it as a move away from postmodern irony and narrative fragmentation and towards ancient Greek myth. In this class we will explore the show as a case study in making the black underclass simultaneously spectacular and theoretically invisible.The show will provide a set of texts for students to undertake detailed textual analysis, and to deepen their readings drawing on other texts provided in the class, and on students' own readings of the world.    MCC-UE 1200-004 / Topic: Digital Media, Advocacy, and Equal Rights, in the U.S. and Abroad Instructor: Isra Ali, Mondays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    In this course we will examine different moments in which digital media plays a significant role in the advocacy for equal rights related to gender and sexuality. We will look at domestic, transnational, and international advocacy. We will consider how the political, economic, and social, impacts the way digital media is deployed, paying particular attention to forces such as militarism, nationalism, and corporate interest. We will identify who utilizes digital media to participate in the discourse, how that usage impacts and relates to offline activism, and the role digital media plays in reshaping the conversation about gender and sexuality. We will look at how people engaged in these causes use digital media to speak to one another, and to traditional media outlets that want to hear from them as a result of the presence they build on digital media. We will also examine how the notion of gender and sexual equality is articulated through social media, and think critically about the concepts of gender, sexuality, and equality, and the institutionalization of this advocacy.    MCC-UE 1200-005 / Topic: Mediating Israel/Palestine Instructor: Helga Tawil-Souri, Wednesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Israel-Palestine &ndash; whether approached as a particular place, a political problem, a conflict, or even a metaphor &ndash; is fraught with controversies, contradictions, questions, and misunderstandings. More often that not, the more one learns about Israel-Palestine, the more likely the result is of a feeling of political paralysis (&ldquo;there is simply no solution to this intractable conflict!&rdquo;). This senior seminar will attempt to reverse this by having students collectively work on one media-related problem having to do with Israel-Palestine in order to solve it, as one would do as part of an architecture studio for example. A &ldquo;problem&rdquo; will be decided on during the first sessions of the class (for example: build an equitable and shared media infrastructure; improve reporting on the conflict in mainstream media; launch a marketing campaign for a one-state solution). As with any course, students will be introduced to a range of materials; most of the time however students will be asked to bring in readings, graphics and other materials based on individual research to help the collective obtain a deeper understanding of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; and ways to solve it. Each student will also bring his/her own expertise (e.g. historical research, photography, archival work, interviews, sketching, software coding) in order to tackle the various components of the problem we are attempting to solve. Throughout this process, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the complexities of Israel-Palestine, and end the course with a collectively-built solution.    MCC-UE 1200-006 / Topic: Time and Technology Instructor: Kate Brideau, Thursdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Many of our concerns about modern technologies have to do with time&mdash;for instance, the growing inability to sustain attention for an extended period of time, or the ways email and mobile devices seem to expand the hours of the &ldquo;work day&rdquo; indefinitely. But this is not new; technology has long had an impact on our experiences and notions of time. This course will explore that relationship, considering how technology relates both to the deep time of human history, and also to our everyday lives. Technological developments have had a significant impact on how we think about history, memory, life, death, and immortality; the rhythms by which our cities move; the speeds at which we live life, and the ways we think about labor and leisure. In this course we will engage with media archaeology, read historical and philosophical works, and analyze photography, film, recorded music, digital media, and the possibilities of biotechnology. In addition to learning about the mutability of time as it relates to technology, this course will encourage students to think critically about how technology is affecting time as they experience it today, and what relationship to time they would like to have. Should we now be turning back toward slowness as we seem to be moving ever more quickly into the future?             MCC-UE 1210 - Senior Honors in Media, Culture, and Communication   Prerequisite: senior standing and department approval to pursue honors in the major. Open only to MCC majors with senior standing.

View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1303 - Privacy and Media Technology   Few values have been as unalterably disturbed by developments in new media as privacy. This course presents a philosophical, social, and legal inquiry into the impact of digital communications upon privacy &amp; its meanings, in order to prepare students to recognize, contextualize, and analyze privacy challenges created by new information technologies. We will explore the philosophical roots of privacy as a deeply held social value and consider how it may conflict with other values, such as freedom of speech, anonymity, efficiency, accountability, and national security.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1346 - Fame   Fame, notoriety, renown &ndash; the desire to be recognized and immortalized is the most enduring and perhaps the most desirable form of power. Culture, commerce, politics, and religion all proffer promises of fame &ndash; whether for fifteen minutes or fifteen centuries. This course departs from the insight that fame is a uniquely human ambition and a central force for social life. Together, we will investigate this subject by asking, what is fame?, Why do people want it?, How do they get it?, What can they do with it?, How does it affect those around them, and the generations that come after? In other words, what kind of good is fame? Drawing on texts from history, ethnography, theory, literature, philosophy, and contemporary media, this course will reflect on the ethics, erotics, pragmatics and pathologies of fame. We will compare fame to other forms of recognition (reputation, honor, etc.), and look at how fame operates in various social and historical circumstances, from small agricultural communities to enormous, hyper-mediated societies such as our own. Is fame, in our contemporary understanding, possible before photography? We&rsquo;ll consider the enduring question of fame as it is transformed by the technological conditions of reproducing reputation across space, time, and societies.
