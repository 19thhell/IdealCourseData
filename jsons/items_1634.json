It is dedicated to the role of America in the world with an emphasis on processes of transnational exchange in U.S.-European relations in the twentieth century, and more particularly in the period of the Cold War. Klimke analyzes the multi-faceted impact \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas and cultural practices have had once adopted in different sociopolitical settings, and the ways in which U.S. history has become intertwined with other countries\u2019 politics and societies. The increasingly global cultural, political, and military presence of the United States, especially after World War II, as well as the country\u2019s complex entanglement with the forces of globalization, are at the center of his scholarly interests. A special focus of his research is transnational protest movements, processes of cultural transfer, and global networks of dissent, e.g. with respect to 1960/70s protest movements, the African American freedom struggle in the 20th century, or the grassroots activism of the 1980s.

Email:         Areas of Research/Interest   Comparative studies of the Americas, theory and history of the novel, Cuban and Caribbean Culture, nationhood and imperialism, syncretism and visual culture, memory and popular culture, national poets, public intellectuals and cultural genealogies, U.S. Latino cultures, North-South studies/cultural politics of the global South, gender and narrative, psychoanalysis and social mythologies.         Professor Dopico teaches comparative studies of the Americas as a member of both the Comparative Literature and Spanish and Portuguese Department. Her research interests integrate theories of genre with culture and geopolitics. Her first manuscript, Houses Divided: Social Crisis and Genealogical Fantasies in Novels of the Americas deals with the U.S. South and Latin America, with national and hemispheric politics, and with the novel as counter-history. Professor Dopico works on and has taught courses exploring the culture, politics and representation of the global South, and is interested in the connection between critical and postcolonial theory and North-South Studies. Her research and writing on Latin America has focused on Chile, Mexico and most recently Cuba, tackling questions of nation, cultural and gender politics, political repression and the power of visual cultures. Her work on public intellectuals and national history in Cuba is reflected in her role as editor of Jose Marti: Revolution, Politics, and Letters , a two volume translation of the works of the Cuban national statestman and poet forthcoming from Oxford University's Library of Latin America. Professor Dopico's work on Cuba is integrated with her interest in art, photography, and popular culture in Cubanologies: Patriotic Aesthetics, Island Vision, and the Dialectics of National Culture. Her Houses Divided: Genealogical Imaginaries and Political Visions in the Americas is forthcoming from Duke University Press. Professor Dopico also teaches courses in the U.S. Latino and is interested in the emergent and minority literatures of the United States and in their singular status as a corpus reflecting how writers negotiate between originary loyalties, hemispheric and global diasporas, and U.S. national genres and political urgencies.
