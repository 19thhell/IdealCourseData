Curriculum Vitae              Bio   Edward Berenson is a cultural historian of modern Europe. He has mostly worked on nineteenth and twentieth century France, but his recent research is comparative and transnational. His study of imperial heroes focuses on Great Britain as well as France, and his new book on the history of the Statue of Liberty brings the United States into the picture. He is currently at work on a history of modern Europe since 1500 to be published by Oxford University Press. Beyond his work on empire and colonialism, Berenson is interested in the history and meaning of celebrity, fame and charisma, having co-authored and co-edited a book on this subject with Eva Giloi of Rutgers University. Another of Berenson's projects involves the relationship between history and memory, between the social and political uses of the past and the construction of memories in an individual's brain. He is particularly interested in the memorialization of traumatic events in historical museums, monuments, and other public commemorative sites. In addition to serving as professor of history, Berenson is director of NYU's Institute of French Studies and NYU director of the Center for International Research in Humanities and Social Sciences, a collaborative project with France's Centre national de recherche scientifique. He received the American Historical Association's Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award in 1999 and was decorated by French President Jacques Chirac as Chevalier dans l'Ordre de Merit in 2006.

You need a ticket and an ID, and when you finally make it to your destination&mdash;after a boat ride, extensive security checkpoints, and  a strenuous hike&mdash;everyone speaks a foreign language.             In 1882, Bartholdi wrote: &ldquo;The Statue commences to reach above the houses,  and by next spring we shall see it overlook [all of paris].&rdquo;      For historian Edward Berenson, director of NYU&rsquo;s Institute of French Studies, the  visit was the rare research mission that didn&rsquo;t require a passport. In his latest book,   The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story (Yale University Press), Berenson unpacks the  largely misunderstood story behind the statue&rsquo;s French origins, and traces its path as one of America&rsquo;s most famous symbols.   When the statue was first conceived of in 1865, France had experienced nearly a century of revolution and counterrevolution. In the midst of Napoleon III&rsquo;s authoritarian regime, a small group of liberal Frenchmen imagined a monument to the United States&mdash;which had just emerged from the Civil War a battered but still-united, democratic republic&mdash;that would also serve as a rebuke to their own dictatorial government.   By the time the statue was dedicated in 1886, Napoleon III was gone, replaced by the moderate French Third Republic. Lady Liberty quickly settled into her role as an American icon, one whose meaning has continued to shift with the tides of culture and history.            Berenson spoke with NYU Alumni Magazine about the copper colossus, and his own re-education in American history.        Your book is part of the &ldquo;Icons of America&rdquo; series, but much of it takes place  beyond our shores. It&rsquo;s amazing how little most Americans know about the French history  of the Statue of Liberty. Basically they think it was a gift from France, which it wasn&rsquo;t.  It was a gift from certain French people to the American people&mdash;the governments were not  involved.   None of the editors I worked with, for example, knew that Gustave Eiffel had built   the skeleton. Nobody knew there was an Eiffel tower inside the Statue of Liberty.      Were you familiar with the statue&rsquo;s history when you took on the project? I knew a lot about the French iconography, the history of Marianne, [their national] symbol of liberty, and all that kind of thing, so what I had to do in order to write this book was learn about the American side of the story.   What was the American reception like? Had there ever been such a gift from one people to another? It&rsquo;s pretty unusual. There were a few skeptics in the U.S. who referred to the statue as a Trojan Horse, but most of the opposition wasn&rsquo;t that explicit. It was more like: Why should we want this? We don&rsquo;t have classical Greek and Roman statuary; that&rsquo;s not who we are as 19th-century Americans. So when [French sculptor Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Auguste] Bartholdi first tried to sell the idea, a lot of Americans were befuddled.   One of the other things I learned is just how decentralized the United States was at the time, and so people from Philadelphia, much less San Francisco, couldn&rsquo;t possibly see why they should care about a statue that&rsquo;s going to go up in New York Harbor.    The statue was proposed at the end of the Civil War. Were the French making a specific  statement? It&rsquo;s completely fascinating. Emperor Napoleon III wanted the South   to win the Civil War because he wanted to see a weak and divided U.S.&mdash;he had designs   on Mexico.    So there&rsquo;s a whole geopolitical thing, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really   important to specify that it wasn&rsquo;t a gift from the French government, because that   government was pretty hostile to the U.S., and certainly hostile to its democratic values.   What was your research process like? There was a lot to do. Bartholdi&rsquo;s wife, who outlived him by a decade, deposited his papers in the Conservatoire National des Arts et M&eacute;tiers, which is the training institute for technology. It&rsquo;s mainly a massive archive of press clippings&mdash;from French papers and American papers, from German papers&mdash;and that was phenomenal. I had free rein, so I could follow the public opinion about it, and then I found all kinds of images.   And one of the things I discovered is that, because of all the drawings of the Statue of Liberty, the illustrated press, [it] was a reality before it even went up&mdash;and not just a reality, but a celebrity.   One of the reasons why this foreign import, which didn&rsquo;t really have any   intrinsic meaning here, could get accepted in this country, and then embraced, is because   the mass media of the time made the statue so much of a reality that by 1880 or so,   most Americans couldn&rsquo;t imagine not accepting it.   How do you think the book will be received in France? It has a different meaning, but there&rsquo;s a real pride that a lot of French people feel about the Statue of Liberty. There are 13 replicas in France, three in Paris and the rest sprinkled around the countryside. Once Bartholdi made the model, it made sense to run off some copies. And the foundry ran off a lot of copies.    Now there&rsquo;s an entrepreneur who just created another dozen because he was able to make a digital mold from the original plaster model. He&rsquo;s selling them for more than a million dollars apiece.              photo courtesy photography collection, the new york public library, astor, lenox and tilden foundation"}]},

He&rsquo;s selling them for more than a million dollars apiece.              photo courtesy photography collection, the new york public library, astor, lenox and tilden foundation"}, {"content": "Statue of Liberty - Media History of New York - NYU Wikis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Skip to content    Skip to breadcrumbs    Skip to header menu    Skip to action menu    Skip to quick search                                                                    Spaces                                      Create                          Quick Search                     Help                                                            Online Help                             Keyboard Shortcuts                            Feed Builder                            What\u2019s new                             Available Gadgets                            About Confluence                                                                                    Log in                                                      Media History of New York    Pages  Blog    Child pages   Content   Statue of Liberty     Browse pages  Configure Space tools                                                               Add                                                     Comment                                      Tools                                                     A t tachments (2)                                           Page History                                           Restrictions                                                               Page Information                                           Link to this Page\u2026                                           View in Hierarchy                                           View Source                                           Export to PDF                                           Export to Word                                                                                                    Pages                               Home                               Content                              Skip to end of banner                  JIRA links         Go to start of banner                          Statue of Liberty                                                                                                                                                                 Skip to end of metadata                                         Created by  Bridget D Murphy , last modified by  Ashlyn G Michalakis on Dec 17, 2010                  Go to start of metadata                                                         Statue of Liberty by Bridget Murphy   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a unique perspective that can be observed, peering out of the small windows in the Statue of Liberty\u00bfs crown. Her view is one of the Island of Manhattan, a cosmopolitan urban center that is characteristic of the innumerable cultures and lifestyles that make up our melting pot of a city. People travel from all over the world to call this place 'home;' A home of opportunity; an opportunity for change; a change for freedom. Lady Liberty oversees all of this, maternally ensuring the guarantees agreed upon in the declaration she is ever-clutching at her side.    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since the celebration of her inception, however, the Statue of Liberty has not successfully overseen liberties of America. Suffragists were outraged at her unveiling ceremony in 1886 due to the intentional exclusion of women to the ceremony. Similarly, an African American newspaper expressed its distaste of this Statue of Liberty being erected in a nation that was not yet fully free for all. 1 The symbol of freedom was an inaccurate representation facing those current realities in the United States. The country, while making strides towards freedom and equality in the wake of the Civil War, was still suffering from growing pains, facing a discrepancy between intentions and reality.    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That same line of freedom is still being negotiated in the United States that the Statue of Liberty overlooks today. Though it has been over 100 years since Lady Liberty was erected, not much has changed in America. Highlighted particularly after the September 11 th attacks, our nation remains fragmented and afraid of the proverbial \u00bfother.\u00bf The fear is so paralyzing that the Statue of Liberty herself has felt the ripple of consequence. Audiences can no longer freely travel to and from the statue\u00bfs breathtaking view of the Manhattan area. We, as free citizens of the United States, can no longer gain the Liberty perspective, but can only admire it from afar. In this way, our modern America is still the America of 1886. We look up to this symbol of freedom, one that we are still unable to grasp and achieve for ourselves.     1 &quot;\u00bfLiberty enlightening the world,\u00bf indeed! The expression makes us sick. This government is a howling farce. It cannot or rather does not protect its citizens within its own borders. Shove the Bartholdi statue, torch and all, into the ocean until the &quot;liberty&quot; of this country is such as to make it possible for an inoffensive and industrious colored man to earn a respectable living for himself and family, without being \u00bfku-kluxed,\u00bf perhaps murdered, his daughter and wife outraged, and his property destroyed. The idea of the \u00bfliberty\u00bf of this country \u00bfenlightening the world,\u00bf or even Patagonia, is ridiculous in the extreme.\u00bf    For Further Reading:  Bell, James B.; Abrams, Richard L.
