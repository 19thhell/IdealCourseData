Members of the department are drawn from different disciplines (including anthropology, history, Islamic studies, language instruction, literature, and the study of religion) and are committed to providing students with a solid disciplinary grounding; at the same time, the department fosters interdisciplinary and comparative approaches to the study of the Middle East and the Muslim world.    Subject to approval by the DGS and their advisor(s), students may opt for one of several available \u201ctracks\u201d of course work and supervised research leading to the doctorate in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. Each of these tracks may have its own specific requirements, in addition to or instead of the basic requirements for the doctorate; see below for details. At present the tracks offered by MEIS include: culture and representation; Arabic literature; and Islamic studies. The fields of research are not limited to these tracks as long as there is a faculty member who supports your research interests within the department.
