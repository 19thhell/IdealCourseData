Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and Maria C. Raven of the University of California and published in the December issue of Health Affairs, the new analysis of hospital emergency department (ED) use in New York City by Medicaid patients reveals that conditions related to substance abuse and mental illness are responsible for a small share of the emergency department visits by frequent ED users, and that ED use accounts for a small portion of these patients\u2019 total Medicaid expenditures. However, according to the study, frequent emergency department users have a substantial burden of disease, often having multiple chronic conditions and many hospitalizations.     The article, \u201cDispelling an Urban Legend: Frequent Emergency Department Users Have Substantial Burden of Disease,\u201d analyzes data on emergency department visits by 212,259 New York City residents who received their first emergency department care in 2007. The researchers reviewed each patient\u2019s eligibility, ED use, Medicaid fee-for-service spending, and diagnostic history. The main part of the analysis covers the three years before each patient\u2019s first visit to a hospital emergency department, the 12 months after the initial visit, and the subsequent two years. As the authors write, \u201ccontrary to urban legend, most repeat users in the study did appear to have relatively strong linkage to ambulatory care, at least as evidenced by their high rates of primary and specialty care visits. Except for ED users with ten or more visits in the index [initial] year, ambulatory care visit rates actually exceeded ED visit rates.\u201d     While hospital emergency department use is not a major cost driver for the Medicaid program, an improved understanding of Medicaid beneficiaries who frequently obtain ED care could help inform the current policy debate over how to meet the significant needs of this population and how to contain Medicaid expenditures, according to the researchers.     Importantly, the analysis indicates that \u201cpredictive modeling\u201d based on information provided at a patient\u2019s initial ED visit could be used to identify individuals likely to return to the emergency department frequently. Billings and Raven write that the predictive modeling approach, coupled with an understanding of the characteristics of frequent ED users, offers health care institutions an opportunity to design targeted, cross-system health care interventions to keep future high users from having to return to the hospital for emergency care.     \u201cIt is also important to note that only a small number of \u2018frequent fliers\u2019 are ultra-high ED users or serial high ED users, with frequent ED use year after year,\u201d Billings and Raven assert. \u201cTo date, most thinking by providers and policy makers about the problem of frequent ED users has focused on these serial users, but the overwhelming majority of frequent users have only episodic periods of high ED use, instead of consistent use over multiple years. More needs to be learned about these patients (they, too, could be interviewed in the ED), and predictive modeling and quick intervention will probably be critical since their repeat ED use is unlikely to continue over time.\u201d     John Billings is a professor of health policy and public service at NYU Wagner, where he directs the Health Policy and Management Program.

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and Maria C. Raven of the University of California and published in the December issue of Health Affairs, the new analysis of hospital emergency department (ED) use in New York City by Medicaid patients reveals that conditions related to substance abuse and mental illness are responsible for a small share of the emergency department visits by frequent ED users, and that ED use accounts for a small portion of these patients\u2019 total Medicaid expenditures. However, according to the study, frequent emergency department users have a substantial burden of disease, often having multiple chronic conditions and many hospitalizations.     The article, \u201cDispelling an Urban Legend: Frequent Emergency Department Users Have Substantial Burden of Disease,\u201d analyzes data on emergency department visits by 212,259 New York City residents who received their first emergency department care in 2007. The researchers reviewed each patient\u2019s eligibility, ED use, Medicaid fee-for-service spending, and diagnostic history. The main part of the analysis covers the three years before each patient\u2019s first visit to a hospital emergency department, the 12 months after the initial visit, and the subsequent two years. As the authors write, \u201ccontrary to urban legend, most repeat users in the study did appear to have relatively strong linkage to ambulatory care, at least as evidenced by their high rates of primary and specialty care visits. Except for ED users with ten or more visits in the index [initial] year, ambulatory care visit rates actually exceeded ED visit rates.\u201d     While hospital emergency department use is not a major cost driver for the Medicaid program, an improved understanding of Medicaid beneficiaries who frequently obtain ED care could help inform the current policy debate over how to meet the significant needs of this population and how to contain Medicaid expenditures, according to the researchers.     Importantly, the analysis indicates that \u201cpredictive modeling\u201d based on information provided at a patient\u2019s initial ED visit could be used to identify individuals likely to return to the emergency department frequently. Billings and Raven write that the predictive modeling approach, coupled with an understanding of the characteristics of frequent ED users, offers health care institutions an opportunity to design targeted, cross-system health care interventions to keep future high users from having to return to the hospital for emergency care.     \u201cIt is also important to note that only a small number of \u2018frequent fliers\u2019 are ultra-high ED users or serial high ED users, with frequent ED use year after year,\u201d Billings and Raven assert. \u201cTo date, most thinking by providers and policy makers about the problem of frequent ED users has focused on these serial users, but the overwhelming majority of frequent users have only episodic periods of high ED use, instead of consistent use over multiple years. More needs to be learned about these patients (they, too, could be interviewed in the ED), and predictive modeling and quick intervention will probably be critical since their repeat ED use is unlikely to continue over time.\u201d     John Billings is a professor of health policy and public service at NYU Wagner, where he directs the Health Policy and Management Program.

Vivian Cipolla, age unknown, as a true lady would never reveal her age, dedicated more than 50 years of service to NYU when she retired just a few years ago. Not only was she an ambassador for NYU, but indeed, she was also an ambassador for higher education around the world.   For decades, Vivian was the face of New York University outside of the United States. In an era when most universities were focusing on domestic outreach, Vivian was a trailblazer, spreading Perstare et praestare around the globe. She truly cared about the students, and the diverse backgrounds they were coming from. And not only was she one of the great experts on international educational systems, but she also knew their histories and how they developed into the systems that we know today.   Vivian at the 2013 OACAC Conference   Washington Square first welcomed Vivian Cipolla in 1958. She had graduated early from high school and wanted a part-time job before starting college. Little did anyone know when she was hired as a file clerk in the admissions office at the Washington Square College that one of the grande dames of NYU had just arrived on-campus.   Over the next fifty years, she went from a file clerk, to an admissions evaluator, to Associate Director, to Chair of Admissions, only the second woman at the university to hold a chair position. When the University sold the Heights Campus in the early 1970s, and Undergraduate Admissions was first consolidated, Vivian was named Deputy Director, and then Vice Dean, and eventually, in 1987, the University\u2019s first Director of International Admissions.   Beyond the distinguished titles, which she had been awarded over her long and successful career, was the Vivian that so many loved and adored.\u00a0In the days following her passing, she has been described as an icon, a one-of-a-kind lady, who lived life to the fullest with a contagious smile and a witty line. While I am not one of the thousands of international students who Vivian welcomed to Washington Square, I consider myself lucky to be among the thousands she impacted during her career at NYU.   Vivian, words cannot express the heartache that so many feel right now. You were an inspiration, and will never be forgotten.                       6 Comments                A true lady. She will be deeply missed by all who knew here. Her smile and laughter were her calling card. No conference will be the same without her. . NYU has lost a gem.                             Andrew Whyte                   December 22, 2014                                                    Based on the title and the baxround I bet no one can ever replace her  *she soundslike someone special*                             Sheinny                   December 23, 2014                                                    Sorry for my spelling                             Sheinny                   December 23, 2014                                                    Based on what I&#8217;ve seen, she seemed like a very remarkable person. My condolences&#8230;  Stay strong NYU!                             Jackson                   December 24, 2014                                                    She was remarkable. You will be in our hearts forever. Miss and Love You Aunt Vivian.                             Virginia                   January 2, 2015                                                    Vivian was an amazing woman&#8211;a natural leader, she had a quick intellect, high standards, and a heart of gold. She signed my acceptance letter to GSAS, and then, luckily for me, she became my boss in 1976 when she was Associate Director of Undergraduate Admissions, and I joined as Assistant Director. Her ethics and professionalism were impeccable, and she demanded much of those who worked with her. She was so respected and beloved, we fell over each other trying to meet her expectations. Her sensitivity to her co-workers, her colleagues at NYU and beyond, and, most important, to the students she assisted, were unequaled. She was a teacher, a mentor, and a dear, dear friend to many, many of the people who worked with her for decades after. Vivian will be sorely missed by the many of us who love her.
