If you wish to change programs within your current school or college, please contact your school\u2019s advising office directly for information on their interdepartmental transfer process.   To be eligible, you must be in at least your second semester of consecutive full-time study at your current NYU school or college. Students who have previously applied for an internal transfer and were denied admission must wait one full academic year before becoming eligible to reapply. Likewise, students who have already completed an internal transfer must wait one full academic year before applying for another. Students in the Core Program in Liberal Studies must complete the Core Program before transitioning to a new school/college for the beginning of one's junior year. Students interested in transitioning to a school/college that has additional academic or artistic requirements which may compromise the ability of a student to graduate in 4 years, should contact their Liberal Studies advisor to discuss options for beginning the transition process in one's sophomore year.     There is no application fee for internal transfers. You may submit only one application at a time. Applications submitted after the stated application deadline will be considered only on a space-available basis.   To access the online internal transfer application, log into NYU Albert . Click the &quot;Application Center&quot; link and follow the instructions.            Deadlines   Application deadlines have been established to enable as many internal transfers as possible to pre-register in their new school or college. Applications submitted after the deadline will be considered only on a space available basis.   The deadline for Spring start for internal transfer applicants is November 1. The deadline for Summer and Fall start is March 1.            Financial Aid   If you receive financial aid, please note that, with few exceptions, your current financial aid package will be transferred to your new school or college. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid at (212) 998-4444 with any questions once you are admitted to a new school or college.                    Notification   Notification for internal transfer applicants occurs on a rolling basis following the application deadline. Applicants will receive decision before the end of the academic semester in which they apply.            Registration   Until receiving an official acceptance email from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, internal transfer applicants should proceed with registering at their current school or college for the following semester. If you are granted internal transfer admission, you should contact your new school or college to secure a new registration date as well as more detailed instructions about the registration process. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will make every attempt to provide the admissions decision in time to complete early registration in your new school or college, but this is not guaranteed.             Notes:     Former NYU students who wish to re-enter the University via a different school or college than the one they attended may use the internal transfer application only if they have not attended another college or university since leaving NYU. Otherwise, they must file the Transfer Application of the Common Application .   Internal Transfer applicants and students completing the Liberal Studies Core Program should note that any minor declared in your previous program of study will not carry over to your new program. After consulting with an advisor in your new program, you may re-declare your minor if you are eligible to do so.   With the exception of Tisch School of the Arts students, former students who wish to re-enter the same school, college or division they once attended and who did not attend another college or university since attending NYU should log into NYU Albert , and complete the &quot;Undergraduate Application for Readmissions&quot; under the &quot;Application Center.&quot; Former Tisch School of the Arts students seeking readmission to Tisch should file the Tisch Readmission Application, available through their department.

You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

If you wish to change programs within your current school or college, please contact your school\u2019s advising office directly for information on their interdepartmental transfer process.   To be eligible, you must be in at least your second semester of consecutive full-time study at your current NYU school or college. Students who have previously applied for an internal transfer and were denied admission must wait one full academic year before becoming eligible to reapply. Likewise, students who have already completed an internal transfer must wait one full academic year before applying for another. Students in the Core Program in Liberal Studies must complete the Core Program before transitioning to a new school/college for the beginning of one's junior year. Students interested in transitioning to a school/college that has additional academic or artistic requirements which may compromise the ability of a student to graduate in 4 years, should contact their Liberal Studies advisor to discuss options for beginning the transition process in one's sophomore year.     There is no application fee for internal transfers. You may submit only one application at a time. Applications submitted after the stated application deadline will be considered only on a space-available basis.   To access the online internal transfer application, log into NYU Albert . Click the &quot;Application Center&quot; link and follow the instructions.            Deadlines   Application deadlines have been established to enable as many internal transfers as possible to pre-register in their new school or college. Applications submitted after the deadline will be considered only on a space available basis.   The deadline for Spring start for internal transfer applicants is November 1. The deadline for Summer and Fall start is March 1.            Financial Aid   If you receive financial aid, please note that, with few exceptions, your current financial aid package will be transferred to your new school or college. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid at (212) 998-4444 with any questions once you are admitted to a new school or college.                    Notification   Notification for internal transfer applicants occurs on a rolling basis following the application deadline. Applicants will receive decision before the end of the academic semester in which they apply.            Registration   Until receiving an official acceptance email from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, internal transfer applicants should proceed with registering at their current school or college for the following semester. If you are granted internal transfer admission, you should contact your new school or college to secure a new registration date as well as more detailed instructions about the registration process. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will make every attempt to provide the admissions decision in time to complete early registration in your new school or college, but this is not guaranteed.             Notes:     Former NYU students who wish to re-enter the University via a different school or college than the one they attended may use the internal transfer application only if they have not attended another college or university since leaving NYU. Otherwise, they must file the Transfer Application of the Common Application .   Internal Transfer applicants and students completing the Liberal Studies Core Program should note that any minor declared in your previous program of study will not carry over to your new program. After consulting with an advisor in your new program, you may re-declare your minor if you are eligible to do so.   With the exception of Tisch School of the Arts students, former students who wish to re-enter the same school, college or division they once attended and who did not attend another college or university since attending NYU should log into NYU Albert , and complete the &quot;Undergraduate Application for Readmissions&quot; under the &quot;Application Center.&quot; Former Tisch School of the Arts students seeking readmission to Tisch should file the Tisch Readmission Application, available through their department.

You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

Transfer Student Programs                              At the Student Resource Center (SRC), we recognize that students transferring or visiting from other universities, as well as those students transitioning from our abroad sites, have already had some college experience and know what it is like to be a college student. Our job is to help you understand what it is like to be an NYU student and to help you navigate a new campus, new policies and procedures, and a new campus culture.   For transfers, we understand that you may have many questions about your transfer credits, financial aid, and academic advising. For both transfers and transitioning students, we want to help you get involved and become familiar with the variety of resources that will help you with your acclimation to a new campus.   With the help of Transfer Ambassadors and professional staff from Transfer Student Programs at the SRC, you will be provided opportunities to attend fun and informative programs that will help you to meet other students. Check out the various links below to learn more about ways to get involved with one of our many programs.
