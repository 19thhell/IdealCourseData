Jews in the Muslim World in the Middle Ages HBRJD-UA 104 Offered every two years. 4 points.

Through a discussion of the problem of adjudication we will address the large problem of how much autonomy the Jews actually had.

In addition to discussion of secondary readings, classes will focus on the close reading of seminal primary sources in English translation. Israeli Politics in Comparative Perspective HBRJD-UA 711 Offered every two years. 4 points. One of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance. The objective of this class (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution. This course will attempt to address the growing interest in comparative analysis of middle-eastern politics, with a focus on the State of Israel. Israeli Territorial Politics: Between Security &amp; Identity HBRJD-UA 712 Prerequisite: general knowledge of contemporary Israeli/Middle Eastern politics. Offered every two years. 4 points. This course will explore the evolution of and conflict between different concepts of borders in Israeli domestic discourse and their respective impact on Israel's territorial policies and international boundaries. After considering the role of security and identity in shaping broad domestic understandings of territory in Israel, we will examine how these concepts have uniquely influenced Israeli compromise or lack thereof in the Sinai Peninsula, Southern Lebanon, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, and the West Bank. To accomplish this goal, this course will incorporate a range of scholarly historical and political readings on Israel as well as films and regular student-led discussions on relevant current events.

The Gender of Peace and  War   HBRJD-UA 784 Offered  every third year. Feldman. 4 points.   Is there a \"natural\"  fit between the sexes and the pacifist or military impulse? This  question has been at the core of the discourse about women and peace  ever since its inception in the 19th-century European peace  movements. This course traces the history of this debate, placing it  within the general theoretical discussion over essentialism versus  social and cultural constructivism (or, more commonly, \"nature\"  versus \"nurture\"). Readings include fiction, poetry, and essays  by activists and theorists alike, from Europe, America, and the  Middle East.

Over the past few  decades, many readers have come to a fuller appreciation of the  emotional and imaginative power of the Bible's narratives, which  still speak with remarkable clarity to our own sensibilities, leading  one critic to characterize the Bible as a \"full-fledged kindred  spirit\" of modernism. The course pursues this \"kindred spirit,\"  using a broadly literary approach as its guide. While the focus is on  narrative\u2014the Pentateuch (Genesis to Deuteronomy) and the Former  Prophets (Joshua to Kings), as well as shorter narrative books (Ruth,  Jonah, and Esther)\u2014it also studies Ecclesiastes and Job as ancient  precursors to modern skepticism. Finally, it studies one modernist  engagement with the Bible: Kafka's Amerika. Jewish Backgrounds to the New Testament HBRJD-UA 25 4 points.

Jews in the Muslim World in the Middle Ages HBRJD-UA 104 Offered every two years. 4 points.

In addition to discussion of secondary readings, classes will focus on the close reading of seminal primary sources in English translation. Israeli Politics in Comparative Perspective HBRJD-UA 711 Offered every two years. 4 points. One of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance. The objective of this class (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution. This course will attempt to address the growing interest in comparative analysis of middle-eastern politics, with a focus on the State of Israel. Israeli Territorial Politics: Between Security &amp; Identity HBRJD-UA 712 Prerequisite: general knowledge of contemporary Israeli/Middle Eastern politics. Offered every two years. 4 points.

To accomplish this goal, this course will incorporate a range of scholarly historical and political readings on Israel as well as films and regular student-led discussions on relevant current events.
