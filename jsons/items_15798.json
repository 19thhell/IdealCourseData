In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate.

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate. Undergraduate and graduate students also benefit from the extraordinary opportunities available through the diverse offerings of a major university in the cultural capital of the world, New York City.
