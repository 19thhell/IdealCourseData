The minor has two goals:       To develop an understanding of normal communication processes.    To develop an understanding of the nature of communication disorders across the lifespan.       This minor can enable students to complete some foundational prerequisite courses required for graduate programs in speech pathology. At the completion of the minor, students will have:       Gained familiarity with normal speech, language and hearing processes;    Developed a basic understanding of anatomy and physiology of the speech and hearing mechanism;    Become familiar with the disorders that affects the ability to communicate across the lifespan;    Been introduced to the impact of speech, language and hearing disorders on communication processes across the lifespan.       Advisement    The Communicative Sciences and Disorders minor is open to all undergraduate students at NYU. The minor consists of 15 - 18 points and has one required course: CSCD-UE.17 Introduction to Communicative Sciences and Disorders, which may be taken at any point during a student&rsquo;s course of study. Students can choose a minor concentration to focus on one area of interest: pediatric, adult/neuroscience, graduate school preparatory or customized, which allows students to take courses outside of the department in linguistics, psychology or American Sign Language.    Students wishing to declare a minor must meet with our academic advisor to enroll in restricted courses and discuss course selection. Note: Please consult with an advisor from your department or school before meeting with the advisor from our program.
