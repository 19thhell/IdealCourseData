After consulting with the translator, Nanette Twine (now Nanette Gottlieb), Dawn Lawson developed this electronic edition.   Optical character recognition was done on the pdf image file to make it searchable, and then it was converted to html, with links added for navigation purposes.   The original Japanese script for quotations from Japanese works, which appeared only in romanization in the original, has also been added from digitized versions available freely online.   Except for corrections of a few minor typographical errors, no other changes have been made to the translation as originally published.   A digitized version of Sh&#333;setsu Shinzui in the original Japanese is available at    http://csx.jp/~amizako/index.html .          Nanette Gottlieb , who holds the copyright to this translation, has agreed to make it freely available on the Internet for nonprofit educational purposes.   Please contact Dawn Lawson with any questions or comments about the electronic edition.               EDITOR'S NOTE       Dr. Nanette Twine translated Sh&#333;setsu Shinzui while holding an appointment as a research scholar at Queensland University in 1971/72.   She worked under the supervision of Mrs. Makiko Bulmer of the Department of Japanese Language and Literature.   Later, while holding her present university appointment she considerably revised it, to bring it into the form in which it is now presented.         I have pleasure in issuing the translation of this seminal essay in this series. The compressed Meiji period style and erudite vocabulary of the work present difficulties smoothly overcome in Dr. Twine's neat and easy sentences.   And the accessibility in English of the full text of such an epochal critical document will materially assist both scholars and students of modern Japanese literature.      J. I. Ackroyd    Editor             PREFACE       Tsubouchi Sh&#333;y&#333; (1859-1935) was a literary critic, translator of Western literature, and novelist who had a profound influence on the young writers of Meiji Japan, most notably Futabatei Shimei (1864-1909).   He began to formulate his ideas for changing the face of Japanese fiction while a student of Western literature at Tokyo University.    Sh&#333;setsu Shinzui (The Essence of the Novel), published in nine parts between September 1885 and April 1886, was an attempt to present a then radical view of    the true novel, drawn from study of Western novels, as an art-form in its own right, and, by so doing, to expose the deficiencies of the Japanese novel and open the way for its reform.         The novel in Japan had long been considered unworthy of the attention of the educated.   Tsubouchi, while admitting that Japanese fiction till that time was for the most part either sensational or dull and moralizing, nevertheless    contended that it could be transformed by looking upon the novel as a form of art the equal of poetry, music, or painting, and making realism rather than    didacticism the aim of characterization and plot.         The first, largely theoretical section of Sh&#333;setsu Shinzui seeks to trace the development of fiction and to define the nature of the true novel.   The second offers a series of practical suggestions for writing a novel, dealing with plot, style, and characterization.         Tsubouchi himself proved unable to apply his theories successfully to novel writing. It was Futabatei Shimei, in Ukigumo (1887-1889), who most closely realized his ideal.    Sh&#333;setsu Shinzui itself was Tsubouchi's greatest contribution to the new wave of realistic fiction.   It prepared the way for modern Japanese literature by raising the status of the novel to that of a respectable intellectual undertaking, and by indicating the ways in which that undertaking might most successfully be performed.          Sh&#333;setsu Shinzui has never been translated in its entirety before, although the preface has been translated by Donald Keene in Modern Japanese Literature .   A number of paragraphs also appear in Marleigh Grayer Ryan's Japan's First Modern Novel: Ukigumo .   The text I have used is found in Gendai Bungaku Taikei Vol. 1, published in 1967 by Chikuma Shob&#333;.      Nanette Twine    Language Centre,    Griffith University,    March, 1981         THE ESSENCE OF THE NOVEL                            INTRODUCTION       How splendid has been the history of the novel in Japan! Antiquity gave us Genji Monogatari, Sagoromo Monogatari, Hamamatsu Ch&#363;nagon Monogatari, and Sumiyoshi Monogatari 1,    followed later by Ono no Ots&#363;'s 2 J&#333;ruri Monogatari and the popular fiction of Ichij&#333; Zenk&#333;. 3    Closer to our own times, the fame enjoyed by such writers as Saikaku, Kiseki, Jish&#333;, F&#363;rai, and Ky&#333;den contributed still further to the novel's ever-increasing popularity.    4 The literary talents of the day competed in producing historical romances. Ikku and Samba wrote humorous stories, Tamenaga Shunsui love stories. 5    Both Tanehiko's Inaka Genji and Bakin's Hakkenden are famous works of this period. 6          Then the upheavals of the Restoration put a temporary stop to the work of popular writers, with the result that the novel lost ground.   Recently, however, it has made a very considerable comeback, the times being now more propitious to the publication of fiction.   Everywhere one sees in print all sorts of stories and historical romances, each trying to outdo the others in originality.   Things have come to such a pass that even newspapers and magazines are publishing rehashings of threadbare old novels.   As a result of this trend, there are innumerable novels of all varieties in circulation in Japan today--the sheer profusion defies description!   One may well say that the present happy reign of Meiji is a period of unprecedented prosperity for the novel.         At the end of the Tokugawa period, the prolific output of Bakin, Tanehiko, and others brought fiction a wide readership. Young and old, men and women,   country and city dweller alike, all pored eagerly over historical romances,   extolling them to the skies. The popularity of the novel was still far from its   present proportions, however, because readers in the early part of this century   were to some extent connoisseurs who purchased and read only works of   outstanding quality. Inferior novels rarely attracted attention, remaining in   manuscript form, unable to enter circulation because they were naturally   outclassed by superior works. Or, if they did get into print, they often ended   up as food for bookworms, rarely seeing the light of day. The range and number   of books in those days were, therefore, no doubt rather more limited than at   present. Today, all that has changed. How extraordinary it is that every novel   or romance should enjoy the same popularity regardless of its quality, no matter   how poor the tale or how vulgar the love story, whether it is an adaptation, a   translation, a reprint, or a new work! This is indeed a golden age for all types   of fiction!    There is certainly no shortage of writers of popular   fiction, but most of them write adaptations of other people's work. Not one can   be called an author in his own right. Every recently published novel has been   either a reworking of Bakin or Tanehiko, or an imitation of Ikku or Shunsui.   Novelists of late have taken to heart the words of Li Yu 7   --they regard didacticism as the main purpose of fiction, and construct a moral   framework within whose bounds they strive to devise a plot, with the result that   even if they have not consciously set out to ape earlier writers, the restricted   scope of their work nevertheless forces them along already well-worn paths. A   deplorable state of affairs!    Poor writers are not solely to blame for things having come to this pass. On   the contrary, a large share of the responsibility rests with undiscriminating   readers throughout the country. In Japan the novel has traditionally been seen   as an instrument of education. It has often been asserted that its primary   object is to encourage virtue and condemn vice. In reality, however, the only   really popular stories are those which are sadistic or pornographic. Very few   people even so much as glance at more serious offerings. Novelists lack   self-respect. They are slaves to public opinion and puppets of fashion, falling   over themselves to pander to the tastes of the times with erotic love stories   and bloodthirsty period pieces, always following the latest fashion. Yet even   so, they find it difficult to abandon the outward appearance of moralizing. In   their determined attempts to accommodate it, they present a distorted view of   human nature, misrepresent social conditions, and devise illogical plots. So   badly do they bungle things that no mature, educated person can bear to read   their work; yet still they trifle idly with the novel, never discerning what its   real object should be, but only clinging obstinately to their misguided ways.   The situation is utterly ridiculous, or rather, utterly deplorable!    I myself have been fond of novels since my youth. For more than ten years, I   frittered away valuable time on them whenever I had some to spare, but in doing   so I learned a great deal about both early and modern fiction. It is because I   also believe I have come to understand something of the true purpose of the   novel that I now presume to offer my theories, such as they are, to the world. I   hope that they will bring readers to their senses and at the same time enlighten   authors, so that by henceforth planning the steady improvement of the Japanese   novel we may finally bring it to the point where it outstrips its European   counterpart and shines together with music, poetry, and painting on the altar of   the arts. If scholarly and intelligent men everywhere will read and thoughtfully   consider what I have to say, kindly passing over my shortcomings and looking   with favour upon my words and the spirit in which they are meant, not only I   myself but Japan's literary world will be fortunate indeed.    March 1885    Note: Tsubouchi added the inscription: \"Written in the living room at   Haru-no-ya, by Sh&#333;y&#333;, the idler.\" Haru-no-ya Oboro was another pseudonym from   the name of his house, Haru-no-ya.             PART ONE    Chapter One    The Novel: An Outline    To explain what makes the novel art, we must first   define the nature of art itself; and to do that, we must determine its basic   principles, casting off popular misconceptions on the subject, which has long   been surrounded by controversy. Most of the arguments advanced have been erratic   and fragmentary--only rarely has any one of them come to grips with the   fundamental issues. An American scholar 1   recently gave several lectures in T&#333;ky&#333; on the principles of art, in which he   demolished a number of common fallacies. Rather than burden the reader by going   over the same ground again, I have decided in the interests of brevity to give   excerpts from his lectures and to follow them up with my own opinions on their   content.    \"Civilization is achieved entirely by the efforts of mankind. Human endeavour   bears kinds of fruit--functional, providing only the necessities of life, and   non-functional, meant to give pleasure and ennoble the character. It is the   non-functional variety that we call art. The main object of art is therefore to   ornament life; but it must not be concluded that, as a consequence, it lacks   purpose, for does not anything that gives pleasure and enriches character fulfil   a great need in society? Both sorts of undertaking are essential. The difference   is that utilitarian labour becomes beautiful because of its practicality, while   art has a practical application because of its beauty. The beauty of this   penknife, for example, lies in its usefulness, while that painting or book is   useful because its beauty inspires us. Looked at in this light, it is clearly   the beauty a thing possesses that makes it art.\"    Someone else, who may have heard this and then   developed the theme in greater detail, said: 2 \"Art   is the mainspring of human development, because its objectives are to give   pleasure and to ennoble character. Because it pleases, it creates a climate of   friendship and warmth among men; because it has a refining effect on character,   it subdues envy, greed, and cruelty. Given material expression, it takes the   form of the exquisite elegance and artistry of painting, poetry, sculpture, and   lacquerware; revealed through voice and posture, that of the serenity and   passion of poetry, music, and dancing. No one encountering its manifestations   can fail to become slowly aware of great concepts of nobility and purity. This   is what I mean by saying that art is a mainspring--it is the true source of a   nation's civilization. Surely it is of the utmost importance to society!\"    As these two scholars say, art is indeed the catalyst in human development,   but I think perhaps their logic is not entirely correct with regard to the   principles which underlie it. I propose now to state my reservations in my own   discussion of the point.    As art in itself has no practical use, one expects its \"aims\" to be only to   give pleasure and to achieve a transcendent beauty. Its perfection may inspire   the beholder to forget greed and cruelty, and rejoice instead in nobler   thoughts, but this to me is a natural side-effect rather than an \"aim\" of art.   It is, so to speak, a chance product rather than an end in itself. Were it not   so, the artists of the world, painters and sculptors alike, would have to work   with ideas restricted by the bounds of a preconceived matrix of \"human   development\". Surely this would be a grave mistake! Anyone making an artisan's   knife does so with the criterion that it must cut well, as its purpose is purely   practical. Likewise an artist, if he decides that his work must contribute to   human development, is bound to keep this aim always before him, whether painting   mountain scenery or carving images of birds and animals--no easy task. It is very   difficult to produce a masterpiece, no matter how hard one strives for   perfection, and it is complicated even further when the artist's ideas are   limited by a stipulation of this sort.    It follows that art, different by nature from practical crafts, should never   be created with predetermined controls. To arouse in the beholder by its sublime   beauty emotions so profound that his spirit seems involuntarily to soar--that is   its proper objective, and that is what makes it art. To beget nobility by its   elegance and integrity, by the excellence of its concepts, so that man's nature   is bettered in the process, is an incidental effect and not its true aim.    Leaving the word \"aim\" aside, we may say that art is by its very nature   something which gives man pleasure and improves his disposition, but it would be   a mistake to make too much of these characteristics. The point may seem trivial,   perhaps, but I state my case for thinking men to consider.    It will not do to group all forms of art together under   one heading. They may be loosely divided into two categories--the visual arts of   painting, sculpture, inlaid woodwork, weaving, copperwork, architecture, and   landscaping, and the abstract arts of poetry, music, and j&#333;ruri . 3   The appeal of theatre and dancing lies in their combination of the   qualities of both groups--they bring poetry and j&#333;ruri to life, enriching   them with the charms of music. Small wonder that they have always been   universally popular!    The forms taken by art are many and varied, as outlined   in the preceding paragraph, but their aim is always the same--to please the   beholder both visually and emotionally. The appeal of some is, by their nature,   directed chiefly to the mind; of others, to the ear. The visual arts, for   example, where form is paramount, set out to attract the eye; music and song--the   ear; and novels, poetry, and drama--the mind. In the execution of the visual   arts, therefore, attention is lavished on colour and shape, while in that of   music and song, voice is the central concern. Because poetry and drama appeal to   the mind, they focus not upon colour or sound but upon human emotions, which   have neither shape nor voice. The ancients, in speaking of a poem as a verbal   picture, were lauding the ability of poetry to open our eyes to the details of   those things not easily seen or painted--and nothing in the world is harder to   capture on canvas than man's passions. A superficial portrayal of joy, anger,   love, malice, grief, fear, or greed presents no particular difficulty, but it is   more than a painter can do to plumb their depths. Many things are beyond even an   actor to portray. Is it not true that in Japanese theatre those obscure passages   whose meaning is hard to convey through stage dialogue or mime are performed   with an additional chobo 4   accompaniment? Surely this alone is enough to illustrate the strengths of    j&#333;ruri !     Our    tanka 5 and    ch&#333;ka 6 , by   comparison with Western poetry, are very simple--they do no more than express a   transient emotion, rather like Western emotional or elegiac poetry. Most Chinese   verse is just as simple. Poems like \"Chang Hen Ke\" or \"Pi Pa Xing\" 7 do   bear some resemblance to Western poetry, but their narratives are flimsy and   their overall characteristics dissimilar. Western poetry, of course, takes many   forms. These include epic poetry, narrative poetry, didactic poetry   concentrating on edification, and witty, ironic or satirical poetry, as well as   lyrics for musical accompaniment, dramatic verse for stage performance, and many   others too numerous to list. In short, Western poetry bears more resemblance to   the novel than it does to Japanese verse, in that it strives to portray   situations from life. Tanka and ch&#333;ka, it must be said, belong to   an earlier backward age, not to the civilized present. I do not mean to   disparage our own product, but human nature does necessarily change and become   more complex as a result of the expansion of knowledge brought about by cultural   development. Where once a mere thirty-one syllables sufficed to reveal the   thoughts of our unsophisticated ancestors, today those of modern man cannot   possibly be encompassed by so few. Poetry of this kind, that cannot portray   other situations because the limited number of words at its command enables it   to deal fully only with the emotions, does not realize its full potential, and   is thus not the artistic equal of Western poetry. What a waste!     Some time   ago, the eminent scholars Toyama, Yatabe, and Inoue, dissatisfied with Japanese   poetry, published Shintaishish&#333; . 8 Any   reader curious about Western poetry may form a reasonable idea of its outline by   reading this, together with the new poetry published in T&#333;y&#333; Gakugei   Zasshi 9 and   Inoue Sonken's long poem \"K&#333;j&#333; Shiragiku\". 10    The novel may be described as blank verse, and as   verse not restricted to a certain length. It is a serious mistake to take the   superficial view that rhyme is the goal of poetry. The most important   constituent of poetry is the beauty of its spirit. If a poem succeeds in   mirroring both calm tranquillity and peaks of excitement, it has fulfilled its   proper function--why should it be necessary to contrive trivial rhymes? The great   English poet Milton 11   long ago argued against the practice. He abandoned rhyme and began to devise   long poems in blank verse. Prosody may have had considerable importance in the   days when poetry was chanted, but not today, when we savour the excellence of a   poem's content by reading it through silently. Like colour in painting, rhyme is   non-essential. We may say, therefore, that it is both possible and also   reasonable to class as poetry, as an art, a novel which exhibits a like richness   of spirit.    The novel attempts to describe human nature and social conditions. It should   reveal what is obscure, and give a realistic portrayal of the mysteries of   destiny in man's life by spinning the thread of an original idea into a skilful   web of emotions and cleverly devising innumerable d&eacute;nouements from a myriad of   mystery-shrouded beginnings. The perfect novel is therefore able to communicate   subtleties which neither an artist's brush nor poetry nor theatre can properly   convey. Because, unlike poetry, it is neither encumbered by prosody nor   restricted in length, and because, unlike painting and drama, it is so   constituted as to appeal directly to the mind, the novelist has ample scope to   develop his ideas. It is this which gives the novel a place in art--ultimately,   perhaps, it may even enable it to outstrip drama as the greatest of the   arts.    I propose now to flesh out my text by quoting from   what is considered the most thorough of literary criticisms, Kikuchi Dairoku's   translation Sh&#363;ji oyobi Kabun . 12    \"Many types of writing fall within the sphere of poetry, and the difficulty   of determining a standard common to all has long been known. The many prose   compositions evincing lofty poetic sentiments are proof that poetry is not   merely a matter of prosody. And how much more often is the reverse true, that   rhythmic verse does not deserve to be classed as poetry...\"    \"I say there is a single theme worthy of the name of poetry--one that has   never been absent from either ancient or modern verse and prose; it is social   phenomena, the progress and current state of human affairs, subjects with an   extraordinary power to stimulate thought. The plight of man, struggling   valiantly with the unpredictable forces of nature and the whole of society; his   life's unbearable sorrows, its triumphs, loves, achievements, eminence; his   eternal wish to leave a lasting mark behind him; the immensity, the mutability,   the complexity and the wonder of life and nature; the supernatural deity   recognized as controller of the universe; the vastness of the heavens, the   tranquillity of the earth; the rotation of years, months, hours, seasons; human   society; the lives, deeds, and changing fortunes of its kings, generals, and   heroes; the battles which decide the fate of nations; the labours of powerful   men who take upon themselves the betterment of civilization; the great upheavals   in human affairs--all these are part of it. It embraces every human   condition--selfishness, intimidation, nobility, reliability, charm and beauty,   grief, vivacity, animation and colour, everything! Excepted are those mundane   matters essential to daily existence that, though naturally claiming much of   man's attention, cannot compete with the affairs of society in the degree to   which they interest and inspire him, and therefore, of course, cannot be called   poetry. Nor can such things as scientific precepts, academic matters, logarithm   tables, budget calculations, molecular quantities--important though they are--be   put under that heading ....\"    \"It is often said that a lofty theme deserves language with a measured   rhythm, but is this really so? The language of prose is, to draw a comparison   from life, akin to the peace-time running of society. It lends itself to the   description of a leisurely, unhurried frame of mind. If prose is walking, then   poetry is dancing. But ever since prose first became one of the components of   literature and achieved polish, books without number have been put into   circulation. Prose has reached a stage where its themes are fit for poetry, and   the beauty of description reinforcing them equals that of the best rhythmic   verse... Even the style of those prose works of the Tokugawa period showed the   loftiest poetic sentiments, differing from that of poetry only in that it relied   on harmony of language rather than strict metre, thereby permitting unchecked   flow and variety.\"     On epic poetry: \"Any epic poem,   ancient or modern, Oriental or Western, basically tells a story. Stirring tales   of adventure, perils narrowly escaped, encounters with calamitous floods and   fires, breathless suspense, circumstances heart-rending in their pathos, love   stories passing through troubled beginnings to happy endings--all transport the   absorbed reader away from reality into a fantasy world. The material allows   endless variety within the genre. The whole range of this type of literature,   the development of its style from Homer to Virgil, 13   and the transition from the mediaeval romance to the modern realistic novel all   warrant detailed discussion, but they are weighty themes which should be   reserved for exhaustive treatment in a history of literature. I have not time   enough to deal with them here. Works prized as modern specimens of epic poetry,   however, are showing an increasing tendency to play down their tone and   characterization, the more closely to resemble life as it really is, so that the   vicissitudes of their worlds and the everyday ups and downs of their characters   seem both intelligible and natural to the reader. The fidelity of their   portrayal of the demeanour and activities of men and women creates in him the   feeling that he is intimately involved in an actual situation. If, when the   situation happens to be one he has personally experienced, he reacts with   pleased surprise and draws his own parallels, and if the writing is both   realistic and highly pleasing, then no matter what the genre of the work, it   deserves a high place. Defoe made good use of the style of epic poetry in   writing his social expos&eacute;s; Scott and   Bulwer-Lytton, among others, used it to impart a knowledge of history. 14   When a novelist aims to instruct, however, he is usually bent on moral   instruction, and both this and other objectives can actually be attained by   developing the art of writing in the epic style. But writing of that sort,   necessarily committed to pleasing an endlessly capricious public, is completely   subject to changing current fashions, rational or not.\"    Chapter Two    \"\"> The Development of the Novel       The novel is a form of fiction, a modification of the fantasy. Unlike the   fantasy (or romance, as the English style it), which is a tissue of absurdities   fabricated without regard to verisimilitude, the novel sets out to portray human   nature and behaviour, basing its themes on realistic material. The extreme   brevity of such a description leaves many questions unanswered, of course, but I   propose for the moment to postpone elaboration of the principles which underlie   it and begin by recounting the stages in the novel's development.    It may be said that fiction and unofficial histories began to circulate far   back in antiquity. To understand why, we must consider how things were when   society was in its infancy. It was in those days the universal practice among   all peoples to make the venerated head of one particular family the leader of   the whole clan. In a barbaric age of intense fighting, there were many who rose   precipitately in the savage wilderness to become heads of families and, soon   after, clan leaders. Once they had done so, such men naturally related for their   grandchildren tales of the hardships they had endured, and of their own exploits   in battle. The stories were true accounts of their own first-hand experiences   and observations, but, in time, as they were passed on down the generations by   word of mouth, faulty memories and exaggerations finally resulted in the loss of   the original core of fact, and overdramatized versions, transmitted orally over   long periods, eventually became the basis for mythology.    Normal and unremarkable though this practice was for the times, I am inclined   to think that there were three factors in particular which contributed to this   latter pass. Firstly, when a patriarch prospered and grew powerful, his people,   with understandable pride, would cry up quite trivial feats in order to boast to   other clans. They would deliberately misrepresent their ancestors' careers,   inflating their actions into mighty deeds. Secondly, man's innate love of the   fantastic led people to invent stories and misinterpret historical data even   when there was no particular need to do so. Then, too, as a country gradually   grew stronger and a civilized society emerged, it was not thought fitting that   its first leaders should have had humble origins, and so farfetched stories were   concocted to embellish the facts. People were much more pious in those days.   Even if they did not deliberately invent stories, they naturally spoke of their   ancestors as if they were gods, and thought of themselves as descendants of   gods. These three things are the real bases for the improbable stories of gods   found in many countries.    It seems quite certain that the myths of antiquity were the beginnings of the   romance, and that many had been added to or falsified in the telling. Yet the   tales of the gods were originally serious stories, not light entertainment.   Their function was totally different from that of the later romance, despite the   similarities in their natures. Posterity, long accustomed to hearing the   erroneous and distorted versions, did not doubt their authenticity but esteemed   them. As the myths were never regarded as fiction, they were printed with great   respect at the beginning of official histories, and came to be seen as reliable   data throwing light on the early days of the nation.    It is a serious mistake to speak of myths, as some do, as the romances of   ancient times. Nonsensical though they may be, they are intrinsically different   from fiction in that while the stories they relate are not strictly factual,   neither are they pure invention. They are semi-historical, semi-fictitious,   facts dressed up with a combination of invention and misrepresentation to   produce something in the style of a history. It is obvious that both authentic   histories and the romance originated from the myths. The novel and the history   have a common source, their present dissimilarity being merely the result of   their subsequent development.    Through generations of pre-history, historical material was always passed on   in song form, which in the dark ages before the advent of writing seemed the   simplest and most convenient way of transmitting it with a minimum of error. The   singers, wanting to be able to memorize and recite easily, naturally chose as   smooth and fluid a diction as they could. Knowing that stylistic refinement and   graceful circumlocution often catch the attention, they devoted much effort to   clever phrasing. As the wording of those passages in songs which express emotion   is usually full-bodied and elegant, the facts were often distorted for the sake   of this effect. The chants thus became increasingly ostentatious and responsive   to popular fancy, and in the process the veracity of their source material was   much eroded, until little resemblance to the original remained. In this   transformation of mythology from a historical mould to a form of entertainment,   the novel had its beginning. ( The Iliad, by the great Greek poet Homer,   came originally from The Sacred History of Troy; but I have heard that   there are many discrepancies in the events it describes.)    Chanted romances remained in vogue for a very long time, even after official   histories appeared in the wake of cultural development and the dawn of literacy.   By that time, however, they were seen as entertainment rather than as channels   for passing on important historical information, and nothing more than novelty   was asked of them. Minstrels, eager to make a name for themselves, often used   their own invention to expand the original ideas into outlandish stories. The   true romance dates from this time, but the early version, being generally   confined to a rhymed poetic style, resembles its modern counterpart only in name   and not in form.    In time, the romance diversified into several forms.   Some were humorous, others matter of fact. In wartime, they told of military   feats; in gentler times, of love or religion. Many Norman romances concerned   deeds of valour, while early Saxon chronicles often had a religious bent.   Japanese romances were different again-- Sumiyoshi Monogatari, Ise   Monogatari, 1 and   Murasaki Shikibu's Genji Monogatari dealt with love affairs, perhaps in   response to the prevailing contemporary spirit of carefree frivolity.    Such was the admiration for the fantastic in those days, then, that the   instant a tall story written along such lines appeared, it was delightedly   received with a total suspension of disbelief. Even patent contradictions of the   facts were accepted and praised for their singularity; this led authors to   strive actively for novelty, polishing up their writing and trying hard to   devise outlandish plots. Yet because they wrote in order to satisfy public   demand, they could know nothing of such things as the real purpose of art.   Flights of fancy unrelated to the truth went beyond being merely acceptable to   being a matter for pride. No doubt the readers loved it.    As civilization developed further, however, people grew tired of fantasy, and   the popularity of the romance declined. It was succeeded by the novel proper,   the steps in the development of which I shall discuss later.     The heyday   of the romance coincided with that of the apologue, an apologue being a work   which enlightens and instructs women and children in the guise of a nonsensical   story. The English call it a fable. Examples are Aesop's Fables 2 and    Zhuang Zi . 3 The   fable came into being when wise and good men began casting about for a means of   remedying the deplorable state into which mankind was sinking as morality   declined. Society had become hedonistic and idle; people seldom read books, let   alone academic treatises on morality. There was nothing which could be used to   instruct. The solution they finally arrived at was to construct fictitious   stories along the lines of the then popular romance with hidden overtones of   reproof, intending thus to exhort by insinuation. The romance and the fable   accordingly resemble each other in form, though not in substance--the former aims   to entertain, the latter to admonish. A fable is an instrument of Buddha, so to   speak. Its plot, not being the main issue, is simple; taken at face value alone,   it is thin and insipid. When we read it closely, however, and appreciate its   depth, we perceive in it a subtle epigrammatic point. Saru Kani Kassen,    Momotar&#333;, Shitakiri Susume, and Kachikachi Yama 4 are   all fables. On the face of it their stories seem trivial, but on a deeper level   they have profound significance.    It was inevitable that, as cultural progress continued and society reached a   state of civilization, the fable too would change and develop further. Next came   a swing away from the fashions of the past towards extravagance and luxury in   all things. As human knowledge expanded, the fable, too flimsy and insipid,   could no longer be read with pleasure. Particular masterpieces like Zhuang   Zi were kept in circulation by discerning men who valued them, but in others   less outstanding the admonition which was the whole point of these works   gradually lost its sting because scholars, already possessed of an understanding   of moral philosophy from the writings of the sages, had no need of instruction.   They simply enjoyed the cleverness of the construction or the skill of the   writing. Inferior works were relegated to the status of nursery tales or female   amusements, no more than playthings, and their intended exhortation was lost   altogether, for children took notice only of the story and remained completely   unaware of any hidden import. Saru Kani Kassen and Shitakiri   Susume, for example, each contains something of a moral, yet ninety percent   of the mothers and grandmothers who told the stories to children did not realize   it. They thought of them as no more than ordinary fairy tales. And so, this   being all in the nature of progress, the fable gradually lost ground and was   replaced by the allegory.     An allegory   is a type of fiction having a twofold plot--a surface story, and a veiled,   subtler level of meaning. A typical example is the famous Xi You Ji. 5 On   the surface it seems no different from the ordinary run of romances, but closer   inspection reveals its deeper implications. The reader becomes aware of a kind   of secondary plot, profound and wonderful, in which recondite principles of   Buddhism may be perceived. Other works such as Bunyan's Pilgrim's   Progress 6 and   Spenser's masterly Faerie Queene 7 also   have hidden import, sometimes instructing, sometimes castigating. The Faerie   Queene has three levels. On one, it appears to be an ordinary romance. On   another, unspoken, it deals with the mysteries of Christianity. Here and there   one may also distinguish flashes of satire and admonition directed at   contemporary society. It is without doubt an unparalleled masterpiece of   allegory.    There are many other allegories; I have merely chosen the best to serve as   convenient examples. The reader may discover for himself how a moral is   concealed within a circumstantial plot by carefully studying the three I have   mentioned. The allegory, surely, evolved from the simple fable. They are   outwardly different, one very straightforward and the other very complex, but   their common hidden purpose makes it difficult to think of them as separate   genres.    In time, as human knowledge expanded, fashions in clothing and furniture   inevitably changed, and tastes in popular literature swung away from the   unsophisticated to the fanciful and complex. In consequence, the public came to   reject both the romance and the fable as too shallow and insipid. Writers of   romances then began a frantic search for new ideas. They spun out their plots,   made them more complex, and tried harder to give the public what it wanted. The   popularity of the fable, meanwhile, continued to decrease until it was no more   than an amusement for women and children. When even its original purpose was   forgotten, it gradually lost ground until it disappeared entirely. Yet as the   efficacy of veiled exhortation had not passed unnoticed, and there were grounds   for not abandoning this expedient altogether, talented writers attempted to   integrate it into the romance, thereby opening the way for the didactic novel.   Priests with literary talent and virtuous scholars saw that not only were   romances of this sort popular, they also had a powerful influence for good.   Quietly realizing that counselling people and possibly putting an end to moral   turpitude could prove difficult unless they began by taking advantage of this   popularity, they lengthened the fable, gave it a more complex story with a   hidden moral, and brought it out as a competitor of the romance.    Both the allegory and the didactic novel thus began with the fable, but the   two were intrinsically very different. The main purpose of the allegory was   moral instruction, and its story was a means to that end. The didactic novel, on   the other hand, treated the story as paramount and moral instruction as an   embellishment. Because of this, inconsistencies or absurdities in the plot of an   allegory will pass unchallenged if it has a clever meaning, but even a clear   moral cannot redeem a didactic novel with a bad plot. How strange it is that   Oriental didactic writers, unaware of such refinements, consider the novel's   main aim to be merely to impart a moral lesson, and pay scant attention to that   description of human nature which should be their main concern! The root of the   trouble is their failure to understand the difference between an allegory and a   didactic novel. They are like a foolish merchant emulating a street vendor. The   street vendor has hired a space under the merchant's eaves from which to sell   the principle of moral instruction. The merchant, while dealing in human nature   in his main shop, sets up a booth of his own under the eaves to handle moral   instruction as a sideline. In the process, his desire to concentrate exclusively   on selling moral instruction leads him to neglect his regular business, and he   ends by closing down his shop.    Drama, too, began as an enactment of the legends, but   with the growth of knowledge came to be regarded as a means of admonishing   society, conveying a sermon under cover of a story as the allegory did. The    Bakabayashi were performances of ancient events recorded in works like   the Kojiki . 8 They   were regarded as ancient traditions, as yet devoid of any hidden meaning.   England's miracle plays were much the same sort of thing, giving unqualified   accounts of miracles and great achievements wrought by saints and holy men.   Later, the morality plays were different--they were dramatizations of   allegories.    There is of course much more to be said about the development of drama, but   as it is irrelevant to the present discussion, I shall not include it here. I   shall say only that the theatre at its inception was very similar to the romance   in that its sole aim was novelty. With the development of a more advanced stage   of civilization, however, it gradually turned from fantasy and absurdity to   ordinary, simple subjects and then assumed a didactic intent. Thus clearly, it   is human nature and behaviour that form the stuff of drama. Moral instruction is   not its first consideration.    It was inevitable that the romance, in a natural progression, should also   turn gradually away from outlandish plots towards realistic descriptions of   society. In an era of semi-civilization, however, when man's nature was base and   his taste limited in its aspirations, authors lacked pride and the courage of   their convictions. Their work followed the dictates of convention, and they were   far from comprehending the true essence of the novel. They strove neither to   portray human nature and social conditions nor to admonish society, but only to   win momentary fame by conforming slavishly to the current fashion. The people   and situations described in their works were thus not the primary consideration   of the romance but merely the means of satisfying public demand. The hidden   moral was an excuse, nothing more than a temporary expedient to stop intelligent   men condemning the stories as worthless. As it was never the main aim, it was of   course of little efficacy by comparison with genuine allegories. The novels   popular in Japan since the early part of this century have been on the whole   just this kind of didactic novel and not real novels. It is because of them that   perceptive men criticize the novel as low class, destructive and unprofitable,   and the novelist suffers as a result!     When,   then, will the true novel appear? What will set it apart from the romance? It   will probably emerge when drama loses its popularity. In the Dark Ages, people   loved superficial novelty. Their outlook being limited, they were wont to take   an interest in and lavish praise on anything singular enough to attract their   attention. Moreover, human nature was not the same then as now. Our ancestors,   whether angry or pleased, happy or sad, generally exercised no restraint in   expressing their views--all their emotions were obvious from their bearing and   expression. On the other hand, they made little use of the power of reason,   being incapable of controlling the carnal desires of the moment. Even their   innermost thoughts were visible in their faces or behaviour, with the result   that they were prone to eccentricities of all kinds, laughable, reprehensible,   pitiful, or detestable. There were impudent, vulgar types like Zenroku 9 and   J&#333;hachi, 10   and silly fools like Arinari (the clown Ariwaraya Narihira in Himeky&#333; Futaba   Ez&#333;shi ). 11   Such emotional transparency made it simple for contemporary romances to portray   human nature and behaviour, and in the main they did so, presenting them for the   world's entertainment; but there must have been many facets of life which the   authors, not very talented, found it beyond their abilities to describe   realistically.     In such an era, it is usually   drama which is the main vehicle for the detailed delineation of customs and   emotions. Not only is its plot much simpler than that of the romance and its   artistic effect greater, its stage settings and the deportment and dialogue of   its actors also give it the power to bring staged emotions and situations to   life. When a skilled actor performs an outstanding work by a great playwright,   each movement, each smile, each scowl is true to life--under his spell, the   audience lose themselves in the play, laughing or crying like lunatics.   (Everyone knows how the masterpieces of Tsuruya Namboku 12   and great actors like K&#333;shir&#333; and Hanshir&#333; 13   move the townspeople.) The romance of the same period, by comparison, is   slipshod, absurd, and fantastic; it is shallow--steering clear of the subject of   human nature--and lifeless, like the ashes of a fire. The tedium of its plot   alone highlights the vast difference between the two. That is why all over the   world drama prospered and the romance lost ground.    Even so, nothing stays the same forever. Civilization continues to develop,   fashions inevitably change, everything moves forward. As the human intellect   also broadened with cultural progress, people began to develop a taste for show   which affected every detail of their lives. For the most part the adornment was   external, and human nature itself remained unchanged; but outward behaviour   altered considerably. The bizarre customs of earlier ages disappeared little by   little as time passed and intellectual growth led men to try to restrain their   passions and preserve an unruffled demeanour, allowing neither anger nor grief   to show. Gradually, the way in which personalities and social situations were   portrayed on the stage became incompatible with the trend towards less   boisterous behaviour, so that drama was no longer realistic. Rather than   preserving that authenticity that is a property of the theatre, it went a step   further. In other words, instead of trying to reproduce something exactly as it   was, it tried to be larger than life.      To illustrate: whether the subject of   the performance is love or strife, rigid verisimilitude is as unappealing as   total lack of realism. The people of a civilized society find the story of   Hinadori and Koga 14 or   Oshichi and Kichisa 15   uninteresting because their own custom of keeping up appearances prevents them   from freely expressing their feelings in front of a lover, however much adored.   Nor does fighting amuse them. In the days of military government with the   ever-present threat of civil war, even private citizens picked up some knowledge   of the military arts or practised j&#363;jutsu . 16   Faced with a sudden dispute, no doubt they challenged and fought their opponents   in every possible way allowed by the rules. Since a real fight would have been   interesting to watch, a staged version must also have held an attraction. Today,   however, people merely brandish their fists, not following any prescribed set of   rules. Their fights are boring to watch. Not only would a realistic reproduction   on stage serve no purpose, it would also prove extremely difficult. To persist   in staging real situations with photographic accuracy would mean that no one   would waste his money going to see a play. It is only when something goes a   little beyond reality and seems interesting or funny that actors perform it and   audiences go to see it. Thus, whereas the volatile people of former ages   probably found everything in a play interesting because it was possible then to   dramatize situations as they actually were, modern people find everything on the   stage absurd, and as a result there has grown up a group critical of drama's   artificiality. Yet rigid adherence to realism in acting is not only a dubious   practice harmful to the rationale of natural theatre, it is also extremely   difficult to achieve. Consequently, even though civilization is now in full   flower, eight or nine out of ten plays inevitably deal with the past. Even   dramas of contemporary life are performed with old-fashioned touches. An   example: a maiden meets a handsome young man and falls in love at first sight.   Enraptured, she drops the fan she is holding and gazes fixedly at his face. That   sort of thing happened in the days when people were frank about their feelings;   it would not happen today. Yet it is a device much favoured by writers of    ky&#333;gen 17   and kusaz&#333;shi 18   who frequently employ it to indicate love! That fact in itself proves how hard   it is to reproduce present-day situations on stage.    As a result of the developments I have outlined, drama no longer merits   admiration as a mirror of its times. Its audiences are growing inclined to   quibble. Some say wigs are unrealistic, others that masks are unnecessary; some   extremists even argue in favour of abandoning makeup.     (Apropos   of audience comment: as a certain raconteur 19 in   T&#333;ky&#333; once pointed out, the taste of theatre-goers has changed considerably with   time. Realistic performances, no matter what their subject, are enthusiastically   applauded. People praise the subdued colours of Ichikawa Danj&#363;r&#333;'s 20   costumes for their restrained elegance. Stage dialogue resembles ordinary   speech, and shouts of approval greet the substitution of omoi-ire 21   for words to convey a meaning. In years to come, probably, Danj&#363;r&#333; and his   contemporaries will play heroes confined to bed by illness, and nap through   several acts in the dressing room! Who can tell, the humorist asked, whether   public opinion might not swing in favour of cropped hair and unpainted faces on   stage? He joked about how strange it is, and his words bear out my point.)    A further drawback of drama is that there are some things, particularly among   human characteristics, which are impossible to dramatize, as well as some which   no one would be interested in seeing performed. Playwrights have accordingly   never employed them. Were such aspects of human nature to be closely examined   and brought to life by the written word, however, they would make absorbing   reading. Audiences have grown tired of seeing nothing but superficial,   exaggerated personalities. How can subtler natures be savoured in the absence of   fine detail? The theatre is disadvantaged in this respect.    Drama is simply mimicry. Normal characteristics are harder to imitate than   idiosyncrasies--an ordinary voice, for example, is not as easy to mimic as the   voice of an actor with distinctive speech traits. Long ago, the superficiality   of human nature meant that all a man's feelings showed in his face, so that   there were often unusual things to be seen, which was very convenient for the   stage. Cultural development put an end to eccentricity, however, and many things   can no longer be dealt with by omoi-ire alone. Perhaps this is another   reason why the theatre has gradually lost ground to the novel.    The scope of the novel is on the whole wider than that of the theatre. It   affords a comprehensive and satisfying portrayal of contemporary society.   Whereas the depiction of personality in the theatre is limited by its dependence   on visual and aural appeal, the novel, by communicating directly with the   reader's mind and stimulating his imagination, has a much wider range. On stage,   nature, scenery, houses, and furnishing are represented by paintings or props.   Mechanical devices are enlisted to give evidence of rain, wind, and storm. All   these things are described in elegant prose in the novel, captivating the   reader's spiritual eyes. The degree of interest aroused in him thus depends on   the strength of his own imagination. For some, the best part lies outside the   text; for others, within the text itself.    (The works of the English novelist Sir Walter Scott are replete with   elaborate description. When writing about a cave which was a brave rebel's   hideout--in Rob Roy --he took the trouble to leave his house and go to a   cave said to have been the man's old lair. There he scrutinized the area and   made notes of the various flowering plants then coming into bloom, before   returning home to write a graphic description of the place for his novel. Such   detailed descriptions of scenery are not only riveting, they are also the   fort&eacute; of the novel--no theatrical   props can equal them!)      There is a fourth drawback to the   theatre in the unwieldiness of its plot. As the primary appeal of a play is to   the eye, there must be some clear and logical connection between the events of   earlier acts and those of later ones. It is particularly important that the   final catastrophe of a tragedy be clearly traceable to an earlier cause. The   nature of the final catastrophe is perhaps difficult to grasp without first   understanding what tragic drama is. There are, of course, many tragic Japanese   romances, but as they have only the substance of tragedy without the name, two   or three examples are needed to make the meaning of the word clear. Sanada no   Harinukizutsu , 22   recently performed by Danj&#363;r&#333;'s troupe at the Shintomiza, 23 is   a tragedy, as are Sanmon Gosan no Kiri 24   and Banzuiin Ch&#333;bei . 25   Such plays centre around a sorrowful, heartrending plot in which the main   character--the hero--meets an untimely end in the last act. His death may take   various forms. There are suicides and murders, thieves who perish on the   execution ground at dawn, and double suicides for love. It is the death of the   hero that is known as the final catastrophe. Should his death be accidental,   unrelated to any earlier events, the audience is bound to find it less   interesting; they will feel as though something has been snatched from their   grasp. In a novel, on the other hand, the incomprehensibility of accidental   death works to heighten the sense of climax, perhaps because although many of   life's vicissitudes can be traced to a cause, many others are the result of   chance. (I shall discuss this further in the section on plot.) Schiller 26   was right when he remarked, in a discussion on plot in drama, that the d&eacute;nouement of a play must be a consequence   and not an accident.    Despite the novel's superiority to the theatre in the ways noted above, it   cannot arouse people to the extent that drama can, because, of course,   imagination does not have the same degree of impact as first-hand observation.   But to disparage the novel for this reason is like classing a beautiful gem as   rubble because of a small flaw. The idea is not even worth discussing!    Through the ongoing process of evolution I have   outlined, the novel will inevitably have its day of popularity. The operation of   natural selection, however, is not easy to defy. Macaulay 27   once said of art that it was fated to die out as civilization progressed. The   argument he advanced was well-reasoned, certainly, but it applies only to art   rooted in the past and not to the novel, which has developed as an art form   during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In On Milton, he   discussed in detail the reasons for the decline of poetry; yet those are the   very reasons which make the novel certain to flourish henceforth! The romance   had its origins in poetry, as I have already pointed out. The two are very much   alike, which means there are bound to be common factors in their fall. If the   true novel has qualities which allow it to replace the romance in the public's   esteem, it ought also to have the capacity to supplant poetry among the   arts.    Perhaps Macaulay was right in saying that the art of   the past has gradually disappeared--it is unlikely that even the glories of   modern English civilization will produce another Milton, or the elegance of   Italy another Virgil. It is only the art form of the novel which has a bright   future. It would not be so very difficult for an author bent on doing so to join   the ranks of the many great modern writers like Scott, Lytton, Dumas, and   Eliot. 28   Fellow countrymen--do not waste your time worshipping Bakin and Shunsui and   Tanehiko, and trying to follow in their footsteps! Make up your minds to avoid   stereotypes, reform the Japanese novel, and write masterpieces worthy of a place   in art!    Chapter Three    The   Aims of the Novel    The main business of the novel is human nature. Social conditions and   behaviour rank second. By \"human nature\", I mean man's sensual passions, what   Buddhism calls the one hundred and eight appetites of the flesh. All human   beings, even those who are wise and good, are creatures of carnal lusts. Sages   and fools alike harbour evil desires--what sets a man apart as good or wise is   simply that he suppresses them, and uses the exercise of his reason or the   strength of his conscience to drive away the hounds of passion.    Very intelligent, dignified men conceal their grosser instincts, never   allowing them to become apparent. It may seem that they have escaped them   altogether, but the fact that they are sentient beings makes that impossible.   That they are temperate, taking neither grief nor pleasure to extremes, neither   becoming angry when anger is merited nor bearing a grudge when one is due, is   attributable to the strength of their rational powers rather than to any   faintness in their passions. Surely, before they attain to that irreproachable   behaviour which others see, they must face many a secret attack from impure   impulses! Lust and reason war within them; good conduct is only possible when   reason wins. Does the man exist--apart from holy beings--to whom virtue comes   naturally? It is precisely because wise men subdue temptation through reason   that we call them wise. Virtue would be nothing out of the ordinary if there   were no temptation to begin with; were that the case, it would be foolish to   call someone a sage.    In the human animal, then, there exists a dichotomy between outward behaviour   and inner thoughts, with as many variations of both as there are faces.   Histories and biographies usually deal with the former; a man's secret thoughts   can seldom be described therein, because of their rambling nature. It falls to   the novelist to plumb the depths of human nature, to reveal it in meticulous   detail, omitting nothing in his portrayal of the inner workings of all types of   minds, not merely those of the wise, regardless of age, sex and moral character.   The true novel is not satisfied with a merely superficial account of human   nature. It lays it bare. How sad it is that although famous writers in both   Japan and China have always scorned superficial plots and tried to give as much   depth as possible to their story lines, they have not hesitated to skimp on   characterization, which should have been their main concern!    A novelist is like a psychologist. His characters must be psychologically   convincing. Should he contrive to create by his own invention characters at odds   with human nature, or worse, with the principles of psychology, those characters   would be figments of his imagination rather than human beings, and not even a   skilful plot or a curious story could turn what he wrote into a novel. Such   characters are like marionettes. They seem at a quick glance just like a group   of real people moving about, but the spell is instantly broken when closer   inspection reveals both the operator and the mechanism. Similarly, a novel at   once loses its charm if it becomes obvious that the author is behind each   character pulling strings to direct his movements.     Let me give an example of what I   mean. The eight heroes of Bakin's masterpiece Hakkenden are   personifications of the eight Confucian virtues. 1 They   cannot, surely, be described as human beings. Bakin's intention from the outset   was to write a novel in which virtues would be represented in human form, and to   convey his message by consistently portraying the conduct of his characters as   perfect. As a didactic novel, Hakkenden is without equal, but as a   description of human nature it leaves something to be desired, since not only   the actions but even the innermost thoughts of the eight remain rational and   pure from start to finish. Surely even during the golden reigns of Yao and Shun   in China, 2 one   could hardly have hoped to find eight such wise and saintly men in the world at   the same time--men who have never experienced even momentarily the inner struggle   between violent passions and reason. Bakin idealized his heroes. They were not   true representations of contemporary man, hence the anomaly. Yet so cleverly did   Bakin contrive to conceal his departure from reality that it passed unnoticed,   and Hakkenden is wrongly acclaimed as a thorough examination of human   nature.    I do not mean to say, even so, that Hakkenden is not a novel because   of this. The fact that it is a great work, long universally known, simply makes   it a convenient example. I have more to say about Bakin's work, of course, but I   shall leave it until later.    The novelist, then, should concentrate on psychological   realism. Once his characters make their appearance in the story, he should think   of them as living people. In speaking of their feelings, he should stand by as   an onlooker and describe things as they really are, rather than superimposing   his own ideas of emotion, good or bad, upon them. Let us imagine that people are   chess pieces. Many are hisha, moving in a straight line to their goal;   many others are kaku, manoeuvering sideways. There are comical    kei, aimless ky&#333;, richly talented gyoku able to change   direction as circumstances dictate, and many, many fu who know only how   to move ahead and not how to escape sideways. Each person behaves in his own   preferred manner as he traverses the board of life. But the straight-moving    hisha may mature, unlike its counterpart of olden days. A fu who   achieves worldly success may sometimes take the straight path. Sometimes    gyoku may fall victim to fu , or a random ky&#333; take    kin and gin . 3    The player is the creator of the universe; his pieces are mankind. His moves   are mysterious and unpredictable. Sometimes, when it seems that a move in a   certain direction by kin must lead to a checkmate, a fu suddenly   bars the way and kin , unable to escape in time, falls victim to    kei . Similarly, a man's success or lack of it in life does not   necessarily reflect his character. Some clever people follow no profession. Some   quite mediocre people achieve their ambitions. The cause and effect   relationship, capable of innumerable variations, is impossible to predict.    If a novelist wants to explore the depths of human nature and paint society   as it is, then he must write as if describing a chess game he is watching other   people play. Should he, as an onlooker, offer even the smallest piece of advice,   the game becomes his instead of the players'! It is only when he resists the   temptation to change those things he thinks he could improve on and confines   himself to the facts that his work can be called a novel.    There is, on the whole, no external difference at all between a novel and a   true story, but the hero of the novel is entirely a product of the author's   imagination. Even so, once a character has made his appearance in a novel, not   even the author may move him about at will. He must think of him as another   person, and ascribe to him only realistic behaviour. When an author interferes,   as Japanese and Chinese writers bent on exhortation have done, by picking and   choosing emotions, discarding some feelings as unsuitable for a particular   character or sensual passions as likely to detract from another, doing his best   to create splendid characters fit to be saints or sages--when he fits the   creative process to an artificial mould of didacticism, then the personalities   and behaviour he describes are not natural but are his own cherished inventions,   unique to his characters.    Since the hero is of course an imaginary character, a novelist cannot be   prevented from idealizing him to whatever extent he chooses, if he so desires,   but it is vital that he set predetermined limits for himself and do his best to   stay within the bounds of human nature. Suppose a painter hard at work on a   portrait of a beautiful woman, made reckless by his desire for perfection, were   to paint eyes, eyebrows, and mouth unlike any ever seen on a mere mortal. No   matter how lovely the face as a whole, no one could call his work a   masterpiece--or at least, not a masterpiece representing a living paragon of   beauty. Were he really set on painting a vision of feminine beauty, he would do   better to model the eyebrows on those of a living woman renowned for hers, and   the eyes on a pair whose loveliness has made their owner famous. As to hair,   facial dimensions and of course nose and lips--taking each of those features from   life would allow him to paint the most beautiful woman ever seen. Should he not   do this, should he create eyebrows and mouth from his own whimsical imaginings,   the result would be a portrait not of a living person but of something more, or   less, than human.    An author, when he sets about creating characters for a novel, should do the   same thing. Seeking out elements of the personalities of people around him and   bringing them together in one perfect character is permissible, so long as it is   done in a way that does not contradict the principles of psychology; but   frivolously inventing peculiar, unnatural types should be avoided.    As I have said before, the novel is basically an art-form like poetry and   drama, but there are naturally some differences. Imitation, for example, is not   one of the aims of poetry, whereas it constitutes the basic tenet of the novel,   which endeavours to reproduce human nature and social conditions in as realistic   a manner as possible. Before the novel developed past the romance stage, its   format was similar to that of poetry and its themes were outlandish. Since it   has taken on its present form, however, it can no longer trifle with far-fetched   plots and absurd stories, and this renders the modern novel a demanding craft   indeed!    When a novelist sets out to describe the personality of a character he has   created, he must first assume that that character already possesses sensual   appetites. He must go into great detail. How will this character feel under the   stimulus of a certain situation? What effect will the arousal of a certain   emotion have on his many other emotions? What difference do his former education   and the nature of his employment make to his emotional processes, not to mention   his character? All the character's hidden thoughts must be exposed. In the case   of a virtuous person (known in kabuki by the term jitsugotoshi ),   the author must do his best to portray only those emotions that such a person   might be expected to feel. In the case of a scoundrel, he must concentrate on   those that an evil heart might harbour. Yet even a good man has a dark side to   his nature, and a scoundrel a conscience--if the novelist fails to show that each   hesitates slightly before he acts, then he has only skimmed the surface without   penetrating to the truth of the matter. Rumour has it that there is an earnest   oil painter who visits execution grounds--among other places--to scrutinize the   movement of the executioner's arm, the play of his muscles, and, of course, the   features of the condemned man. Likewise, the novelist should not presume to   abhor the ugly side of man's nature or the wickedness of his passions, but   should be single-minded in describing them. How else can he come to grips with   the reality of human nature?    I do not mean to imply, even so, that he should seek out and portray even   those deep-buried appetites which embrace obscenity and coarseness. The novel is   art. It must avoid lewdness, as music avoids bawdiness; painting, eroticism; and   poetry and drama, vulgar language.    The English scholar, John Morley 4 , had   this to say about the works of George Eliot: \"An intelligent person once defined   literature as existing solely to provide a critique of life. Why is it that the   novel, which ought to be celebrated as one of the great forms of literature, is   instead often despised and downgraded? Probably because novels so seldom do   offer a commentary on life. There are many who earn their living by the pen, but   they have not all been endowed with the same degree of talent. Some lack   discernment, others ideas. Broadly speaking, few books weave the thread of an   original idea into a fabric of human emotions and vividly illuminate the hidden   workings of causality in our lives by the way they fashion charming yet   endlessly different, constantly changing d&eacute;nouements from an infinite number of   mystery-shrouded beginnings. Life offers many pleasures, none so keen as being   able to penetrate the mysteries of man's nature and comprehend the principle of   cause and effect. To arrive at a thorough understanding of how life is   structured is a very difficult task, one to which shallow, incompetent writers   are not equal. Only those with outstanding talent and unflagging energy are able   to reach the goal.    \"Most highly regarded forms of literature make it their principal aim--and all   make it at least one of their objectives--to comprehend the workings of the human   world. Religion, philosophy, poetry--the form changes with the name, but the   substance is always the study of mankind. They account for all the tricks of   nature which cause our characters and fates to function in certain ways, offer   explanations for the things which puzzle us, banish the clouds of doubt, and   satisfy our curiosity. Whether a reader fully understands their arguments or   not, they remain of absorbing interest as treatises on the nature of life. They   may not enlighten the ignorant, unlearned reader to the point of   self-examination and self-determination, but even he will be able to discern,   albeit vaguely, the justice of what is written within them . . .    \"George Eliot's novels are short cuts whereby the reader may enter this world   of ideas. However, she is loath to pass arbitrary judgment on the merits of her   characters' actions. She simply shows very clearly the interrelationship of   events in their lives and leaves judgment to the reader. Like a sower of other   people's seed, she reaps no harvest of her own; untouched by envy, she leaves it   for others.\"    Morley is right. Aspiring authors should always make the discussion of life   the first consideration of their writing.    The novel reveals what is hidden, defines what is indistinct, and brings   together all man's innumerable passions within the covers of a book, thereby   naturally stimulating the reader to introspection. There is a parallel between   God, who created all things on earth but put nothing of himself into them, and   authors with my way of thinking, who create a variety of characters with   complete impartiality and present every aspect of daily life in a realistic   manner. But the boundlessness of God's creation, the immensity of its scale,   makes it extremely difficult for ordinary, simple people to comprehend the   inherent relationship of cause and effect. A novelist of my persuasion picks out   the essentials, gathers them together in a book, and presents the information   for general examination and evaluation. His is a very great responsibility. If   he discharges it well, he has achieved something truly momentous.    Motoori Norinaga, 5   discussing the central theme of Genji Monogatari in Tama no   Ogushi, said: \"None of the many theories about the theme of Genji   Monogatari has ever taken into account that the work is a novel. It has been   discussed as if it were nothing more than a Confucian or Buddhist tract: this   was not at all its author's intention. True, it shows occasional resemblances to   religious writings in spirit and substance, but not enough to place the whole   book in this category. Its overall tenor is very different. A novel purports to   tell a story, as I remarked earlier . . .    \"In the Koch&#333; chapter, the author writes: 'When she read stories about the   past, she recognized the people and the situations . . .' As a rule, novels deal   with various social situations and people's circumstances and thoughts, so that   reading them leads to an understanding of such situations and of the way people   act and feel. This must be regarded as the real reason people read them.    \"Thus the general yardstick against which the   characters and actions of the persons in a story are measured is the degree to   which they possess mono no aware 6 and   are compassionate and in harmony with their fellows. The presence or absence of   these qualities is what commends or condemns them. Not so far removed from the   concepts of good and evil in religion, we might think; but looked at more   closely, what is or is not in harmony with man's nature is not always consistent   with religious ideas of good and bad. The definition of morality is softened,   instead of being rigidly propounded as in Confucian debates. Certainly there are   many points in the plot of Genji Monogatari where mono no aware is   emphasized to the detriment of religious teachings.    \"Anything irrational among the many, both good and bad,   that move men ought to be resisted, but there are times when emotions take over   from the will, when we cannot help responding to feelings impossible to   suppress. Prince Genji's attempts to see Utsusemi, Oborozukiyo, Fujitsubo 7 and   the others constitute the gravest immorality from the religious point of view;   no matter how numerous his other virtues, he deserves to be condemned. The   writer does not dwell on the fact that he is behaving badly. She merely states   over and over again how exquisite is the sensibility displayed by Prince Genji   in his affairs, making him the model and personification of virtue. That is the   theme of Genji Monogatari --its concepts of good and evil are different   from those of religious works.    \"Even so, immorality of this sort is not condoned. That Prince Genji's   conduct is wrong is made clear without words. Such misdemeanors are often   discussed in books of this sort; we can hardly expect to find them not   mentioned. Genji Monogatari does not lead its reader past doubt to   enlightenment, like some solemn religious doctrine. It is a story of society,   and as such does not concern itself with discussions of the morality of the   events it narrates, but makes mono no aware its criterion of virtue. Its   outlook is rather like that of someone who saves up muddy water, despite its   dirtiness, because he wants to grow a lotus flower to enjoy its beauty. To write   of illicit love is not to admire the turbid mud, the material from which springs   the flower of mono no aware! Prince Genji's conduct is like that lotus   bloom, grown up from the mud into a glorious blossom. No reference is made to   the fact that the water is dirty--only his compassion and mono no aware   are singled out as criteria of virtue.\"    Norinaga's remarks make plain indeed the aims and nature of the novel. Very   few of our countrymen have approached the novel with the insight he displays. I   understand that many classical scholars are deluded by the superficiality of   their knowledge into triumphantly interpreting even Genji Monogatari as a   didactic work. How very wrong they are!    Chapter Four    Types   of Novel    When novels are classified according to their aim, they fall into two   groups--didactic and artistic.    The characters and plot of the didactic novel are   created with an eye to their usefulness in moral instruction, in an attempt to   chide men for their wicked ways. Most writers since Bakin have produced this   kind of work. Within the didactic classification a further subdivision is   possible into commendatory and censorious. The characters of the former are   embodiments of the eight Confucian virtues. Their conduct is depicted as   meritorious, in the hope of invoking the reader's admiration and thereby guiding   him imperceptibly towards righteousness. This was Bakin's aim in writing    Hakkenden and Asaina Shima Meguri no Ki ; 1 the   characters of both are personifications of the virtues.      The censorious didactic novel, on the other hand, uses   different tactics. It chronicles tyranny and cruelty, immorality and filial   disobedience, showing stupidity to be ludicrous, and infamy shameful. It   endeavours to set people on the right path by employing the technique of the   horrible example. Into this category fall Bakin's Mus&#333;by&#333;e 2 ,   Samba's Ukiyodoko and Ukiyoburo , 3 and   the light fiction of Fukuchi Kigai. 4 In   most of his works, however, particularly later ones like Bish&#333;nenroku , 5   Bakin used a combination of both censure and commendation.    The method of censure takes two forms--strict, as in Bish&#333;nenroku , or   humorous and candid as in Kigai's light fiction, which provokes laughter.    The characteristics of the artistic novel are quite different from those of   the didactic. As its sole aim is to describe social conditions, it attempts to   handle its imaginary characters and their imaginary setting in as realistic a   fashion as possible. In the manner of a poet who describes real scenery and   expresses real emotion, an artist who paints the many aspects of nature by   recourse to his palette, and a sculptor who carves out people and animals with   his chisel, its author aims at realism in his plot, characterization, and   description. A novel of this kind never has a hidden meaning or a deliberately   distorted plot. Its author confines himself to describing plausible situations,   hoping to make them lifelike. He strives to reproduce the bounty and beauty and   freedom of nature, to transport his readers unawares to his make-believe world,   and to enable them at last to divine the hidden and mysterious forces at work in   their lives. There is thus in the artistic novel an unintentional means   of exhortation by rebuke: it has an indirect civilizing influence. Above all,   since it sets out to portray modern social situations, the story (even though   its events and characters are fictitious) can be styled a living history which   reveals contemporary social trends, informs of drifts in fashion, and makes   clear the tenor of society. For an intelligent reader, its value is enormous. It   offers an experience far removed from that of groping circuitously towards an   understanding of life's causal relationships gained by researching biographies   of real people or situations from other eras; and it is much more profitable   even than arriving the hard way at an examination and perception of life through   repeated experience.    Japanese novelists, however, do not seem to have understood this. Taking Li   Yu's advice to seek out a moral from commonplace things, they have created a   mould of admonition within whose bounds they try to confine their plot. What a   strange practice!     Classified according to subject   matter, the novel again falls into two categories--historical and social. The   former is constructed around some historical event or personage, the latter   around contemporary situations. Most Japanese novels--the works of Bakin, for   example--are historical, as are the small rice-paper books written in a mixture   of kanji and kana commonly known as yomihon; 6 but   Murasaki Shikibu's Genji Monogatari and most of Tamenaga Shunsui's    ninj&#333;bon 7 are   social novels.    The following diagram outlines types of novel:               There are other kinds of novel,   too many to enumerate, among them political, religious, military and maritime,   but in the final analysis they are all either historical or social novels.   Political novels describe the world of politics. Many are written by politicians   as an indirect platform for the party line--the Earl of Beaconsfield's    Coningsby , 8 for   example. Religious novels are principally concerned with proselytism. There are   no real examples of this genre as yet in Japanese literature. Perhaps the   nearest we have are the miracle stories, or the later novels of Sant&#333; Ky&#333;den.   Military novels deal with either actual wartime events or wartime situations but   involve fictitious characters. They are not the same as our Japanese gunki   monogatari . 9   Maritime novels describe imaginary sea voyages. They bear a slight resemblance   to Japanese tales of such experiences, but while those are romances, maritime   novels are usually just ordinary stories about life at sea.    As shown in the diagram, there are three kinds of   social novel, built around upper, middle, and lower class situations   respectively. There are not discrete classifications; the three are   interrelated, differing only in the characteristics of their heroes. The paucity   of social novels in Japan makes it hard to find examples. Generally speaking,   though, the ninj&#333;bon of Tamenaga Shunsui are set among the lower classes;   sometimes they also deal with the upper. Sant&#333; Ky&#333;zan's 10    kusaz&#333;shi , although ostensibly historical, are really middle and lower   class social novels.     The    ninj&#333;bon versions of Kagamiyama 11   (rewritten by Sh&#333;tei Kinzui 12 )   and Sendai Hagi 13   could perhaps be said to portray the upper levels of society; Genji   Monogatari and Daini Sanmi's Sagoromo certainly do.    Chapter Five    The   Benefits of the Novel    The novel is art. As it cannot be put to practical use, it would be a serious   mistake to discuss its practical advantages. Yet just as there are indirect   benefits in poetry and music, so perhaps a novel also contains some few not   consciously planned by its author; incidental results of an artist's   single-minded desire to give pleasure to his reader by stimulating his aesthetic   sensibilities. A perfect, beautifully executed work of art, as I have already   said, profoundly inspires a reader. Indirectly, it ennobles his character and   rounds out his education. This, however, is a natural response to consummate   artistry and is certainly not the aim of art; nor can it even be correctly   termed a direct benefit.    Before we can discuss the benefits to be derived from the novel, we must   first divide them into direct and indirect. The direct benefit is the pleasure   the reader feels. In other words, the novel is meant to entertain people.   Entertainment takes many forms: the novel strives for the gratification of man's   aesthetic sensibilities--his finer feelings. Civilized man delights in poetic   sentiments and in manifestations of elegance. Once possessed of finer feelings,   he revels in richness and beauty, and loves grandeur. Awe rises unbidden in his   heart in the face of greatness. Excitement and commotion involuntarily arouse   him and inspire him with courage. He rejoices in both elegant circumlocution and   candour. This is presumably the normal condition for a human being! The artist's   duty, and the aim of the true novelist, is to give pleasure by falling in with   these sentiments. If the novel plumbs the depths of human nature, searches out   the details of all that is most obscure in society, and describes that which is   beautiful, majestic, interesting, and humorous, it cannot fail to stimulate its   reader's aesthetic sensibilities. Because its main concern is neither colour nor   sound but human nature in a living world, it presents an aspect of constant   movement. It is much more interesting than music and painting, without being in   any way their inferior.    Even were this not so, John Morley has described the critical discussion of   man's world as one of life's great pleasures. The novel is, so to speak, a   guidebook to life. Within its covers is presented for the reader's appraisal a   graphic description of the reasons why one person fails and another succeeds, or   the ways power tends to corrupt moral sense, or examples of rational behaviour   being abandoned under emotional stress. An intelligent reader finds this much   more interesting than histories or Chinese classics--the explanation, no doubt,   of the eagerness of adults and scholars in Western countries to read novels for   pleasure.     In Japan, the novel has always   been looked upon as a plaything. Novelists themselves have meekly acquiesced in   this assessment; not one has contemplated remodelling the novel into an art-form   to delight mature, educated people. Comparing the Japanese novel with its   Western counterpart is thus like comparing the Utagawa ukiyoe woodblock   prints 1 with   the Kan&#333; paintings. 2 The   prints, though certainly not clumsily executed, lack the quality of refinement;   having nothing to offer the viewer's aesthetic sensibilities, they serve merely   to amuse women and children. Certainly the traditional Japanese view has been   that the novel's only inherent benefit is to ward off drowsiness on a long,   solitary spring day, or to soothe the pangs of loneliness in the drawn-out   autumn nights. The blame for this error--a result of the fallacy that the novel   is not an art-form but a nursery or boudoir amusement--can probably be laid at   the door of authors who take no pride in their craft.    That concludes my remarks on the direct benefits of the novel. Let us now   proceed to the indirect, of which there are several. It ennobles character,   provides moral instruction, supplements history books, and furnishes a model for   literature.    1. The ennoblement of character    I have already discussed this great advantage of art in a general way in   Chapter One. Let me now reiterate the main points.    The novel is not something to be used in the service of man's carnal   passions. It aspires to entertain him by appealing to his more refined tastes. A   taste for elegance and an emotional sensitivity, however, are the most noble of   attributes, to be found only in civilized, culturally advanced peoples. Ignorant   savages give themselves over to the appetites of the flesh. As they know nothing   of intellectual pleasures, their slightest action is motivated by lust. They are   thus carried away by vulgarity, thoroughly selfish, extremely brutal, and   absolutely insensitive to beauty. When a man is tormented by desire and dogged   by passion, his conscience and faculty of reason grow ever weaker, and all that   is discreditable in him is allowed to reign unchallenged. Even a civilized man,   if he turns his talents to the pursuit of fame, riches, and notoriety in   gambling halls, insatiably greedy, caring for nothing but temporal wealth and   fame, will gravitate towards insensitivity and selfishness. However little he   may desire to slide into meanness, he cannot very well avoid it, no doubt   because his lack of spiritual reserves makes him, in spite of himself, a slave   to his appetites.    To achieve control, a man must use the power of reason; yet there are times   when violent passion renders even reason useless. Our carnal impulses may be   likened to a fever gripping a child. At its peak, he struggles against all who   try to make him drink his medicine. Reason is his stern father. No matter how   harshly he scolds, the child, in a fit of wilfulness, refuses to obey him,   whereupon it becomes necessary to resort to a mother's methods. She cajoles the   child into taking the medicine by tempting him first with sweetmeats. When he   grows thirsty and asks for a drink, she gives him the infusion. After he has   taken the medicine several times and realizes it is helping him, he will drink   it voluntarily to be rid of his suffering, and as taking it often reduces his   thirst to some extent, he will gradually stop asking for water alone.    Inadequate though this parallel may be, it does illustrate how our carnal   desires may be controlled. Reason cannot be called into play to cure violent   outbreaks. If the gentle medium of art is invoked to appeal to a man's aesthetic   sensibilities, to arouse his finer feelings, gradually to drive out lust and   lure his thoughts outside the everyday world, and to lead him to an awareness of   the subtler kind of beauty, then he will be uplifted in spite of himself, and   will soon escape from the seas of passion. It is this which makes art so   important despite its lack of practical value. Thus an art-lover who indulges   himself frequently will develop more and more of a taste for elegance and his   character will become increasingly finer. As the novel is an art-form, it too,   of course, offers this benefit. It is a very rare Japanese novel justifiably   classified as art, however, though the reader may find such an assertion hard to   accept. I was hard pressed to find a convincing explanation for this myself. As   I remarked in an earlier chapter, the novels prized in Japan are crude; they   lack the qualities of art. They occupy a position like that of ukiyoe ,   which cannot be called genuine paintings. If we appreciate the significance of   this example, we can comprehend something of the nature of the true novel.    2. Moral Instruction    Earlier writers have frequently asserted that the novel has a contribution to   make to encouraging virtue and castigating vice, a view also widely held in   society at large. Oriental authors in particular have one and all made   exhortation their first consideration: they have held the belief that the aim of   the novel should be to alleviate depression and to benefit its readers through   moral instruction. One naturally expects that any book written with such an   intention will have didactic value! Yet any beautifully written work, even one   not specifically written as a parable, occasionally speaks indirectly to its   reader, impelling him to look closely at himself. With this in mind, I have   included moral counsel among the benefits to be derived from the novel.    I will not here reiterate the advantages of the very popular didactic novel.   I would like, however, to spend a short time clearing away the false ideas of   the didactic novelists and, at the same time, to explain something of the way in   which exhortation is useful, in answer to those short-sighted critics who   question its efficacy even in the didactic novel itself. Some even go so far as   to censure the novel for teaching people to be lascivious and greedy.    Before anyone can pass comment on an object, he must first have analysed it   and familiarized himself with its structure, in order to avoid such errors as,   say, talking about a deer when he really means a horse. The structural   similarity between the two animals could lead someone unfamiliar with horses to   mistake them for each other, and to bring ridicule upon himself by describing a   horse as having spots and living in remote mountain fastnesses.     The same can be said of the   novel. Critics who rush in without first ascertaining its exact nature are   liable to make the mistake of including the novel in their comments on the   romance that bears some resemblance to it. Perhaps the condemnation by some   Chinese of the novel as a corrupting influence fits such novels as Jin Ping   Mei and Rou Pu Tuan . 3 Our   traditional Japanese scorn for fiction as an agent corrosive of public morals   may well apply to that kind of lascivious love story that relates the intimate   details of amorous dalliance. This, however, is nothing but a spurious imitation   of the true novel. Such works do not deserve to be called genuine novels,   because they contain the very element of indecency art must most stringently   avoid. Indeed there can be no doubt that risqu&eacute; love stories are written with the sole   intention of leading people astray. It would not be overstating the case to say   that the blame for the regularity with which these counterfeit novels appear   lies not with their authors but with their readers. Authors generally give the   public what it wants. Why should they have turned out pornography on a regular   basis unless the demand was there? There are certain prurient passages in    Genji Monogatari , but for these the authoress is not solely   responsible--they were an inevitable product of the effete society eventuating   from the Fujiwara 4   assumption of absolute power.    Those who disagree with me are bound to point out that novels invariably   include a love story. Many run counter to moral teachings because they are   written expressly to initiate a trend. Rumour reports that in recent times   children in America and other countries have been influenced by novels to embark   on illicit affairs. Does it not follow, they will clamour, that the novel   counsels vice and encourages lust?    My reply is that because the novel builds its plot   around man's emotions, love between the sexes is indispensable material, for   love is more important than any of man's countless baser desires. Thus a genuine   novel may have as its theme the mutual love of a man and a woman, but it does   not set out to unearth secrets better left unspoken nor to portray debauchery as   writers of the Tamenaga School 5 do.   It goes no further than a subtle, psychologically convincing exploration of the   hidden depths of human nature. Should its reader experience adulterous or evil   thoughts, the fault lies in his own mind and not in the novel.    Naturally, the novel's description of life will prove   thought-provoking to a discerning reader. An intelligent person usually learns   from someone else's example. Those disposed to envy Hisamatsu's elopement with   Osome 6 are   envious by nature, whether they read novels or not. The kind of person who hears   about a girl in the east running off with her lover and is immediately   encouraged to lay similar plans with a girl in the west is not capable of using   another's example to modify his own behaviour, and will experience many   hardships before he achieves enlightenment. To criticize the novel on his   account is unjust, irritatingly misleading, and a nuisance to the novelist.   Zhang Zhu-po's statement in the preface to Jin Ping Mei that the blame   for any attendant evil thoughts lies with the reader and not with the book is   most unreasonable in that particular instance, but would be fair comment in the   case of a genuine novel.    Let me interject a note of warning here! In both East and West, novels are   considered of no importance and are customarily given to young children to read.   This is a very dangerous habit. Children are extremely impressionable; they   react to external stimuli much more sharply than adults. They should not be   exposed to any source of intense mental stimulation, let alone to novels. Art is   certainly a toy, but it is the toy of mature, educated people. While it is not   something to be feared, neither should children be allowed to amuse themselves   with it.    Another argument advanced by the novel's critics is that honourable men, by   virtue of their upright natures, do not need to read novels for any moral   instruction implicit therein. Therefore, they say, its deeper levels of meaning   are intended to benefit either women and children or mediocre men who pass their   days in idleness and debauchery: in fine, it can have no didactic benefit at   all. Women and children are ignorant. They know nothing of the realities of   life. They can enjoy an unusual plot in a novel, but they cannot appreciate its   hidden import. The idle and the self-indulgent read novels only as a panacea for   depression and anxiety, and do not concern themselves with quality.    To this I say that while it is only to be expected that a child who has had   the guidance from birth of right-minded parents will grow into a virtuous,   principled adult needing no prompting to reject evil in favour of good, such a   man will yet suffer occasional involuntary lapses of behaviour. They may not be   sufficiently severe to be labelled immoral or wicked, but if they were to become   common knowledge they would doubtless expose him to derision. A proper didactic   novel spares not even such trivial slips, so that to read it sometimes produces   a twinge of shame even in those who make much of morality. I have a friend in   T&#333;ky&#333; whose scholarship encompasses Japan, China, and the West, a man much   admired for his upright and chivalrous nature. Yet he once told me that reading   about the company of dog-knights in Hakkenden arouses in him an   occasional private pang of self-recrimination. It is his very integrity that   produces his reaction. Others like myself often feel the same way. Should   readers prove impervious to such pricks, it means only that they read without   insight, not that exhortation is valueless in a novel. Those who say that a   moral in a novel is intended for the ignorant man alone have been reading the    kusaz&#333;shi so popular of late. Their ridiculous comments are not worth the   trouble of refuting, for they relate to the romance. The argument is frivolous   in the extreme.    Women and children, being fundamentally ignorant and poorly educated, simply   read the novel for its story and are unlikely to be able to grasp its   significance. Yet it is not right to say that they are altogether unable to make   moral and aesthetic distinctions. There can be no doubt that frequent perusal of   a didactic novel will result in its moral being unwittingly taken to heart, to   become in some degree a source of encouragement and an influence on behaviour. A   perceptive reader, however, would feel its influence more keenly. That is why   the novel is not written for women and children alone!    Some may say that as idlers really only read novels as a form of escapism, it   is only to be expected that such aspects as their deeper implications will be   lost on them. Be that as it may, it will be rare that a man's sense of shame,   however faint, will allow him to enjoy being lampooned, even if he does not go   so far as to grasp the moral, repent at once in mortification, and mend his   ways. Should he do so, the admonition has had an even deeper effect on him. A   moral may not immediately have an influence for good, but it will indirectly   stir a man's conscience. Whether the road to repentance and reform will open up   if frequent pricks of conscience lead him to overcome sensual desire we cannot   know. In any case it is wrong to say that admonition in the novel has no effect.   I may have unwittingly changed my views on this point--perhaps I am stretching   the facts.    According to a certain Western scholar, \"few people realize that the novel   has another marvellous practical advantage in addition to its well known virtues   as a tonic for depression. It is a treasure-house, a repository wherein is   stored a wealth of potential sources of instruction. If a man once opens the   door, he will benefit greatly. The word 'instruction' may suggest concentration   on the principles of duty and morality with comment on the rights and wrongs of   our conduct. I use the term here in a different sense. Certainly moral   principles provide an essential discipline for life and set up valuable   standards, but the instruction I speak of covers a much wider field. Even things   outside the moral sphere have been generally mistermed 'instruction' if they   have had the slightest power to chide people and to improve their inner and   outer deportment. Instruction includes, for example, teaching manners,   cultivating a ready wit, and revealing the quality of human nature and the vast   array of human passions. If a reader has realized that such teaching is to be   found in the novel and has been able to appreciate correctly its true   significance, then we may indeed say that he has succeeded for the first time in   grasping the novel's real benefits, as well as plucking the fruits of pleasure.   Many of those who read novels are strangers to reason. They concentrate only on   the plot in the mistaken belief that they have drawn from it the fruits of   pleasure, when they have seen only the flower, and have never tasted the   fruit!\"    His argument is most perspicacious. It deserves praise as a new theory   elucidating the nature of the exhortation often concealed in the novel.    There remains much which should be said on the benefits of didacticism, but   because of its length I shall omit it here and continue with it later if   occasion requires.    3. Supplementing official histories    By \"supplementing\", I mean that the novel makes good the omissions of history   books, creating a history of local manners and customs through a finely   detailed, graphic portrayal, like a painting. It describes contemporary mores   skimmed over by official histories. This advantage is therefore to be found only   in historical novels; and yet, as even novels of modern life will become the   historical novels of the future, it is indisputably true of them as well.   (Murasaki Shikibu's story of Prince Genji, for example, is essentially a novel   of contemporary life, but from it later generations, exploring the customs of   her time, discover how many things began.) The novelist, while endeavouring to   probe human nature, also scrutinizes customs and manners. He must keep abreast   of his times--nonsensical archaisms are to be avoided!    There are many Western writers who have commented on this aspect of the   novel. Instead of discussing it myself, I shall quote two or three excerpts as   useful testimony.    First, the great English writer, Sir Walter Scott: \"The historical novel   benefits two kinds of reader. The first is the person whose interest in history   is initially kindled by reading a fictitious historical novel, after which he   abandons fiction for history books in order to find out more about the events on   which the novel, of course, is based. The second reads only for pleasure.   Conversant only with contemporary affairs, he knows nothing of the past, and   first becomes aware of the outlines of history through reading historical   novels. Even sketchy knowledge of this sort is better than total ignorance.\"      Hugh Miller: 7 \"An   official history has a strict format. Its details of names, dates, and events   are accurate, but it does not offer a true picture of the times because it   merely skims over contemporary customs and human nature. The characters and   events of historical romances are creations of their authors, just as in popular   fiction, but the depth and complexity of their stories make them all the more   useful in portraying human nature and behaviour, and many are really   photographic reflections of their times. Someone intending to study history and   wanting to know just how things were in his great-grandfather's day will gain   more by reading the novels of Fielding and Richardson 8 than   by wasting his time perusing Dodsley's Annual Registers . 9   Home 10   was closely involved in the uprising of 1745, and in his history of the era set   down hearsay reports as if he had been an eyewitness. Yet comparison with   Scott's Waverley Novels shows that Home failed to mention many aspects of   contemporary life.\"    Thackeray 11   (an English novelist): \"I gain many things from reading a novel. I find out what   the world was like in those times, what the spirit of the day was. I learn about   customs, fashions in dress, and how the pleasures, pastimes and humour of those   days were different from those of the present. People long dead return to life,   a society long vanished reappears, and I feel as if I am in the England of   bygone days. Ah, a novel is a finely-crafted history, with so much more to offer   than an ordinary history!\"    Many others have expatiated on the virtues of the historical novel, but as   all concur in viewing it as a history of manners and customs, I have omitted   them to avoid monotony. I may refer to them later, when I discuss the historical   novel further.    4. Providing a model for literature    I refer here to the way in which the novel is written.   The great masterpieces of literature are of considerable benefit to those who   set out to study them, not only because of the originality and skilful execution   of their plots but also because they are superbly written, every phrase rich in   beauty--witness Genji Monogatari and Shui Hu Zhuan . 12   Writing being first and foremost an instrument for expressing thought, it   follows that violent thoughts demand a fiery style and delicate ideas an elegant   one. Sometimes simplicity will be called for, sometimes detail. Skilful writing   adapts the style to the content, whether simple or complex, robust or gentle,   richly beautiful or unsophisticated.    If, on the other hand, the style remains invariably the same whether   describing pain or joy, then of course it will reflect neither sentiment and the   reader will probably remain unaware of their existence. In times of great anger   or sorrow, for example, the words we use become succinct and highly descriptive.   By descriptive, I mean metaphorical--the type of expression known in the West as   \"figures of speech\", which are both ornamental and elliptical. To illustrate:   when we describe an \"ungrateful wretch\" as a \"beast\" or a \"brute in human form\",   we use a metaphor which compares his lack of shame with an animal's. Under   normal circumstances, the full expression would be \"that fellow is a stranger to   honour!\" We all know, however, that a man does not concern himself with   semantics when emotions are at boiling point; he shortens his utterance to one   or two words like \"beast\" or \"brute\", and underlines significant points with   mime or gesture. But it takes a knowledge of human nature gained through long   experience of life to understand this, and so there are many young writers who   write an accomplished but elaborate style which lacks the power to move people.   They waste their time on sterile writing that expresses barely a fraction of the   underlying thought, a situation resulting from their failure to seek out a   fitting relationship of style to circumstance and theme. Their subject matter   and style are out of harmony.    Man's feelings and thoughts are infinitely varied, however, and to produce an   appropriate style for each one is a difficult task indeed. Unless he is a rare   genius, a writer cannot know without being taught what style will best express   certain thoughts and feelings, or what words will give a certain tone. He must   have an example to follow. The difficulty lies in finding one. To model his work   solely on dissertations written by the old masters may only give him a tendency   to theorize unduly and an overly straightforward style. Yet to limit his studies   to descriptive compositions cannot but result in an excessively elaborate style   devoid of the charm of animation. Strict emulation of the dialogue style hampers   the development of descriptive skills; of the historical style, the ability to   write critically. All these troubles arise from a one-sided approach.    According to Spenser, perfect writing uses an infinite   number of styles to express an infinite number of themes. Someone who sticks to   a single style, however well he handles it, cannot be described as a good writer   in all fields. Those with any aspirations at all towards becoming literary   greats should polish their style by patterning it on one which is both elegant   and thoroughly versatile. A century or two ago, it was enough to be proficient   in only one kind of writing, but the emergence of today's world, with the rapid   advance of culture, has so greatly increased the range of needs to be said and   written that on occasion a descriptive or historical style is called for even in   political attacks and deliberations. It is well known how Burke, when he   impeached Hastings in the House, 13   impressed all those present with his impassioned oration.    As a versatile, beautifully executed style on which to pattern one's own   writing, that of the novels written by the most eminent authors cannot be   surpassed. The task of any novel worthy of the name is to portray the whole   gamut of social conditions and emotions, omitting nothing. It will therefore   contain passages of rich beauty, of grandeur, of deep pathos, and of quiet   elegance. Past events will be related in historical style, situations described   in graphic style. There will be styles for dialogue, denunciation, humour, and   severity. The thoughts of energetic people will be expressed in appropriately   vigorous language, the emotions of mourners in the sombre phrases they deserve.   In sum: because the primary aim is to co-ordinate style and feeling, the style   will undergo an endless series of changes. This is what makes the novel a good   model for a stylist.    I have not yet exhausted my subject, but to relieve the monotony I shall   leave this topic for a while and take it up again in the section on style in   Part Two.    (Let the reader clearly understand that the argument I have just put forward   refers to the perfect novel, and not to the recently popular    kusaz&#333;shi!)    If the novel really possesses such possibilities as these, then, would it not   be seriously remiss of us not to overhaul and improve our crude Japanese novels,   to make them flawless, better than those in the West, to produce a great art   form fit to be called the flower of our nation? To do it, we must work out a   plan for writing the perfect novel by first understanding the reasons for past   successes and failures, taking care not to make the same mistakes again while   seeking out and concentrating on the good points. Without a campaign of this   nature, the Oriental novel will probably always remain at the level of the old   romance, with no chance to develop.    Since it is only a short time ago that I left university, not only have I not   yet written the books I want to write, I have very seldom even done any   translation. My actual experience is thus very limited, but I have spent many   years reading both early and modern novels, and feel I have acquired a fair   amount of theoretical knowledge. I therefore wish to present as a guide in the   second part of this work a discussion of the rules of the novel. If the reader   will be so good as to peruse it carefully and give it some consideration without   dismissing it out of hand, it will not only shed light on the difficult craft of   that great art form, the novel, it will also open the way for the true novel to   eclipse the kusaz&#333;shi .             PART TWO    Chapter One    The   Rules of the Novel: An Introduction    All things in the universe are governed by natural laws. The seasons rotate   in fixed order throughout the year, as darkness follows light in the course of a   day. If even nature is subject to regulation, how much more so are the works of   man! How can they exist without it? The humblest task depends for its completion   upon a set of rules. There is an art to painting, and a rhythm to music. Poetry,   dancing--each has its canons to guide later learners. It is because the same must   surely be true of the novel that I now embark on this discussion.    No doubt there are some who have formed the mistaken opinion of the novel as   a rambling tale hastily dashed off by the author as his fancy takes him, without   rules or standards. They are victims of the superficial view, who have failed to   comprehend the true nature of the novel. The characters and events of the novel,   unlike those of an ordinary biography or history, are entirely figments of an   author's imagination. They are pure invention. If, therefore, an author does not   begin by establishing some kind of foundation on which to start building, the   end result will be sequential confusion, monotony, and jerkiness. Even an   unusual story, though it may meet the objectives of the novel by its perceptive   description of human nature and social conditions, will be boring if it is   poorly arranged and has a tedious, irksome plot. The reader will weary of such a   story halfway through, and lay it aside before he reaches the climax.    Writing a novel is similar to producing a long composition. Its plot and   layout must be systematic, and there must be clearly discernible patterns in its   flow of events. If its plot incorporates both high and low points, if the   texture of its narrative avoids monotony, and if some discretion is shown with   respect to the personalities and situations portrayed, then and only then will   the novel make an impression on its reader, and win honour as an art which   equals poetry and music.    Despite what I have just said, if an author adheres rigidly to a set of rules   and attempts to construct his plot in a contrived manner like an artisan working   to a preordained plan, the scope of his description of personalities and   behaviour will perforce be limited. Even if by some happy chance he does manage   a comprehensive treatment, the overall tenor of his work will be dreary and   lifeless. It is no easy task to produce a graceful, elegant composition by   relying on formulae to prescribe variations in tone. Novelists should bear this   in mind as well.    Writing a novel is like cooking. A cook, simply because he is a cook,   naturally chooses one of the conventional ways of preparing fish as soup,   grilled fish, raw fish salad, or salt fish. So long as the flavour is good,   however, he may successfully serve it raw even when his usual programme calls   for it to be grilled. Or he may devise a new way of salting the fish he should   have used for salad, or grill a fish instead of making it into soup. His meals   are thus not merely palatable but positively interesting. The way to bring out   the best in food is to subjugate preparation to taste. No one reckons on the   order being reversed, and that is why a resourceful cook occasionally exerts all   his culinary skills to prepare a dish in some unexpected way. The key to the   novel lies in a similar approach. The most important thing is to make an   impression on the reader. Rules are used in constructing the plot in order to   prevent his becoming bored, and to elicit his admiration. They are therefore of   secondary importance, a means to an end, and the means must be made to fit the   circumstances. Some laws are immutable, but by no means all. A novelist who sees   a chance to move his reader should adapt himself as a matter of course to the   demands of the occasion. Quick-wittedness of this sort goes by the name of   talent, and should be practised in all types of writing, not just the novel.   Those who do not pay attention to it will fall short of the perfection they   desire. Regrettably, they will kill that which they desire to bring to life.    Generally speaking, rules may be thought of as resembling advice--helpful if   given before the event. To point out an error while the thing is in train may   lead to its rectification, but there will be something clumsy about the handling   of the project, and the end-product will be marred. Rules operate on the same   basis, a fact which should be fully understood before work is begun on the plot   of a novel. If an author fails to realize this, and sticks rigidly to a formula   like someone measuring up dimensions with a ruler, he will end up with a novel   cast in a rigid mould irritating to read. Experienced writers occasionally   succeed by chance; beginners often expect to succeed and do not. A great deal of   thought must be given to the matter.    The following chapters deal with various rules. My   arguments are hastily put together, and are, of course, incomplete--much has been   either left out or not treated in full. The quality of novels and historical   romances, in particular, is chiefly determined by the degree and quality of   their writers' inborn talent. No amount of memorizing guidelines will make   someone not so gifted a match for a person with that instinctive flair which has   nothing to do with rules. Bakin once went to Ky&#333;den and asked to be taught how   to write gesaku , 1 but   Ky&#333;den refused his request with the very proper reply that it was not something   which could be learned from somebody else. The laws of the novel are intuitively   understood--many are very hard to verbalize. That I have here nevertheless taken   several points and explicitly designated them as rules is because of my deep   concern that our inexperienced Japanese novelists should know all there is to   know about the objectives of the great art of the novel. It is certainly not my   intention to expatiate the true rules, which are intuitive. I ask all you   scholars, therefore, not to pounce arbitrarily upon the word \"rules\" and chide   me for my ignorance! The points I make in the following chapters are for the   most part my own personal opinions; it may be that many of them are wrong. It   would give me very great pleasure indeed, and fulfil my original purpose, if you   would correct my mistakes without deriding me.    Chapter Two    Style    Style serves both as a vehicle and an adornment for thought. It is of   paramount importance in writing a novel. If it is clumsy, it robs even the   cleverest plot of life; and if the wording does not flow naturally, neither does   the description. In China and many Western countries where the written and   spoken languages are almost identical, there is no particular need to choose one   specific style, but here in Japan the existence of a variety of styles, each   having advantages and disadvantages, according to the purpose in mind, means   that we have to make a choice of which to use in the novel.    The three styles long used in the Japanese novel, albeit with much diversity,   are the classical, the colloquial, and a mixture of the two. I propose, as a   guide for the reader, to restrict this discussion to the relative merits of   these three, without going into greater detail. I have much more to say about   style in the novel, which I shall omit for fear of becoming overly tedious; but   later I intend to write a supplement in which I shall deal with stylistic reform   rather than variety.    Classical Style    The classical style is known as wabun . 1   Vague and refined, it is naturally suited to euphemistic, elegant prose, but it   lacks a needed air of animation and grandeur. It is reminiscent of a weak,   pliant willow tossed by the wind, or a court lady languishing behind a screen.   In addition to its seductive charm, wabun possesses serene cadences and a   natural classical grace, and is therefore not appropriate for descriptions of   violent emotions, bizarre behaviour, or debauchery, let alone savagery.    As the duty of the novel, broadly speaking, is to present before the reader's   eyes a graphic description of everything from the innumerable phenomena of the   natural universe to the manifold passions of man, there are times when it must   deal with elegance, grace, excitement, gaiety, sadness, loneliness, and   laughter. Even the best plot will be ruined unless the writer is versatile, able   to convey both elegance and grace with equal facility. Sublimity and humour,   beauty and pathos are all attributes of fine writing. They are especially   important to the novel--the lack of even one is sufficient to flaw its style, no   matter how skilfully the other three may be used.    Here in Japan, of course, the age-old dichotomy between pen and sword has   meant that literature was long ago left entirely in the hands of the effeminate   court nobility, with the result that writing became very elegant and naturally   lost a great deal of its frankness and animation in the process. Those books in   particular which later ages have come to regard as landmarks of Japanese   literature are merely the products of the leisure hours of a group of women in   the licentious days of the mediaeval Fujiwara regency; small wonder that their   style is languid. Genji Monogatari , written in wabun , won lasting   fame for Murasaki Shikibu because its style and content, both charming,   complemented each other well, and also, I think, because the quality of her   writing so well matched the spirit of the era. The style of the novel is not   immutable, of course. When human nature and social customs advance further,   style must be adjusted accordingly. It must make appropriate allowances for   changes in language, and strike out in new directions, because the stuff of   which the novel is made is the portrayal of contemporary human nature and   behaviour. Even Murasaki's talent would be hard pressed to produce a description   of our present society in the pure wabun of her day. The following   extracts from Genji Monogatari give some idea why.

Ishikawa Masamochi 2 used   it in &#332;miagata Monogatari and    Tsukushi Bune Monogatari , and Takebe no Ayatari 3 in    Nishiyama Monogatari . The reader may form his own opinion of its relative   merits by perusing these three works.     In this connection let me mention    Miyako no Teburi by Roku Juen, 4 in   which the classical style is used to describe the streets of Edo. The taverns of   Bakuroch&#333; and the streetwalkers, in particular, are dealt with in graphic and   searching detail, but the elegant style used for these mundane matters often   seems incongruous, even laughable. The extreme deliberation of the language in   which arguments are couched makes the speakers seem more like the inhabitants of   Ky&#333;to than like Edokko, 5   proof that wabun is not a fit medium for animation and plain   speaking.    Shikitei Samba and others occasionally used the classical style for humorous   descriptions.

The above excerpt is not written in pure classical style, of course, but   neither is it what I call a combination of classical and colloquial. No doubt   Samba had good reasons for using the classical style in a descriptive passage.   From a purely literary point of view, humour results when the level of the words   used is inappropriate to the subject matter--in other words when obscenities are   expressed in stately words, or a lofty theme in provincial language. Perhaps   that was why Samba used the classical style in the passage quoted. The crux of   the matter is that the classical style, archaic as it is, is not suitable for   describing the present. Unfortunately, should an author persist in attempting a   realistic portrayal of modern society in this style, using it without   discretion, his work will just be classed as humour and provoke laughter where   none was sought.    The classical style, therefore, when used in anything except humorous novels,   has two disadvantages--it lacks frankness and animation, and it appears   flippant.    Colloquial Style    The colloquial style uses the everyday language in its natural state. Being   clear and easily understood as well as animated, it naturally possesses those   qualities of simplicity and lucidity so essential to good writing, in addition   to being extremely vigorous and passionate. Sometimes even the most intimate   thoughts may be elegantly expressed by suiting the rhythm and tone of its words   to the mood. Because of this, the colloquial style is used wherever possible,   except in narrative passages, as a medium of expression in Chinese and, of   course, Western novels.    Despite such advantages, however, there is unfortunately no written   colloquial style in Japan. Our written and spoken languages are so markedly   different that the vernacular in writing either sounds too choppy or has too   common a tone. It gives a provincial air to even the most refined story, and   attracts charges of uncouthness and vulgarity. Moreover, in addition to this   sharp linguistic division, not found in the West, there also exist within our   country at no great distance apart dialects bearing as little resemblance to   each other as English bears to French. The use of colloquial Japanese in   historical novels is therefore not only awkward but quite unjustifiable. It may   be used most felicitously in novels of modern life, being appropriate to their   tone, but even then a certain amount of thought and selectivity is necessary if   success is to be attained. As readers of the Tamenaga school of writers will be   aware, even they, in passages where severity is called for, use   theatrical-sounding dialogue to fill out those parts where the colloquial alone   is not sufficient.      Bakin once said: \"Both the standard   language and dialects appear in books written in colloquial style in China. That   is the way everything is done. Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist works one expects   to be written in standard language, yet Nitei Zensho 6 and    Shushi Gorui 7 are   partly colloquial, and Kik&#333; Shinji , Sh&#333;kan Joben , Kid&#333;roku ,   and K&#333;meizo 8   entirely so. Earlier writers kept the two separate, with the result that   although their style is very elegant, it lacks fluidity because it does not draw   strength from the marvellous power of the spoken language. How much greater are   the divisions within our own written language, between its Chinese and Japanese,   classical and colloquial, and modern and archaic elements! Anyone venturing into   the literary world today must be well aware of them. How very difficult it is!   The writers of such ancient tales as Taketori Monogatari 9 and    Genji Monogatari probably took no special care in choosing words for   dialogue. They just recorded verbatim the normal speech--even dialect--of court   nobles at the time. Naturally, though, that speech was not rough. Although both   classical and colloquial expressions were common in the speech of court ladies,   later ages consider these clever men and women authorities on wabun   because of their very high rank and their literary talent. We may therefore   regard the ancient s&#333;shi monogatari 10 as   being written in the colloquial. The written languages of China and Japan,   though different, resemble each other in that neither can do full justice to a   description of human nature and social conditions without using colloquial   vocabulary. Even so, the unintelligible, hybrid forms of colloquial speech in   circulation today cannot be written down verbatim. In my own opinion, we should   avoid adulterating our style with low-class gibberish.    The spoken language does indeed have many drawbacks, as Bakin points out.   While I cannot argue with what he says, neither can I entirely agree, and so I   propose now to explain something of my own views on the colloquial style.    The description of human nature and social conditions   is fundamental to the novel. It follows that when it is lower-class society the   author is attempting to describe, the language used by the characters must   necessarily be plebeian in character! Used properly, roughness notwithstanding,   it reflects the realities of the common man's life. It cannot therefore be   claimed that there is no place for colloquial style in the modern Japanese   novel. Dickens 11   and Fielding used any amount of slang in their works without attracting   criticism. Fielding was often attacked for being coarse, but coarse in content   rather than style. Not only, therefore, is there nothing to prevent the use in   an appropriate context of even dialectal corruptions or elliptical patois; such,   may even add, to the effect.    The Japanese vernacular, however is verbose to a fault. Strident and   grammatically uncoordinated as well, it does not flow smoothly in passages of   narration (relating the background to things) or description (portraying the   appearance and nature of things). Its verbosity stems from the innate ambiguity   of our language, while its interlarding of Chinese and Japanese words with   corrupted, dialectal forms probably contributes to its lack of either euphony or   grammatical coherence. Furthermore, the way in which the spoken language is used   varies remarkably according to the relative status of the person being   addressed, something which does not happen in Western languages. Some people   make no tense distinctions when addressing others or their own level or below,   so that what in narrative passages is written sara ni koei no shirezari   shikaba may also be expressed as sara ni koei ga shirenu kara , or    tonto koei ga shirenakatta mono da kara or sara ni koei ga shirenu mon   da kara . The last two, used in conversation, are the most casual, so no   doubt the first would be used for narration; but being in the present tense it   cannot be termed suitable for recounting past events. English has a form called   the historic present, but it is rarely used; it is, in fact, normally not   suitable. Depending on the nature of the subject, to speak of the past as the   present can be very interesting, but if a writer were to spin out a lengthy   account of something in our prolix language without distinguishing between the   two, they would occasionally become confused and the sequence of events would be   hard to follow, which is the one thing a reader finds most tiresome. It is my   firm belief therefore, that, while there is no reason not to reproduce the   colloquial language in the dialogue of a story, as long as it remains in its   present unrefined state, it ought not to be used in narrative passages , as I   fear the development of the story would suffer.    The following is an extract from one of the ninj&#333;bon of Sh&#333;tei Kinzui,   a member of the Tamenaga school.

The passage is written in what is called colloquial style, but colloquial   language accounts for only eighty per cent of the whole. Some classical diction   has been blended into the narrative sections, perhaps to overcome the   difficulties I mentioned earlier. Whilst a difference in wording between   dialogue and narrative is only to be expected, there is surely nothing pleasing   about destroying the internal coherence of one of them with anachronistic   expressions. The words I have underlined in the above passage, for example, are   theatrical; no one would employ them today. They are not in harmony with the   words around them. The author does not necessarily deserve a reprimand for   this--he used them because everyday speech is too awkward--but they do detract   from that charm of movement which is the quintessence of the colloquial style.   This naturally undesirable state of affairs comes about because the   incompatibility of style and content prevents the mood being given the full   expression it deserves. As I remarked earlier, using the colloquial style in a   historical novel may prove most unsatisfactory. What is needed is a combination   of both the classical and colloquial styles.    I have also mentioned already that the incorporation of a certain amount of   classical diction makes it much easier to write narrative passages in novels   even of modern life. To combine colloquial dialogue with classical-colloquial   description is not easy, however, and requires a great deal of care on the part   of the author to succeed. If he were to follow a descriptive passage in Bakin's   favourite style with such dialogue as beranmei or oyashinasa ina ,   often used by Shunsui, the two would be at odds and the colloquialisms would   naturally strike a jarring note. On the other hand, slanting narrative passages   too much towards the colloquial style in an attempt to eliminate the conflict is   bound to detract from descriptions of magnificent spectacles. This is where the   greatest difficulty lies. If the colloquial style is to be effective, a new   method of using it must be devised. It will not do at all to try to use Bakin's   style for description and Shunsui's for dialogue. That method is clumsy; it   would have been better to write a ninj&#333;bon style in its original form.   The vernacular may appear to be erratic, but such is not at all the case.   Aspiring authors should give a great deal of thought to these points.    My readers are very much mistaken if they think that I have been   surreptitiously denigrating the spoken language by saying that it lacks euphony   and is full of linguistic corruptions. Language is spirit; style is form.   Emotions are expressed with complete frankness in speech, whereas in writing   they are overlaid with a veneer which to a certain extent camouflages their   reality. Dialogue written in the colloquial savours of a face-to-face   conversation; in a classical-colloquial mixture, it puts one in mind of a   letter, which of course is not nearly as entertaining! Dialogue is one area   where a colloquial style does have advantages. Unfortunately, though, there is   no getting around its defects. Perhaps one of my clever friends will discover a   means of doing so. I shall wait impatiently for the day when a new version of   the colloquial style appears.    Combination of the Classical and Colloquial Styles 12    The classical-colloquial combination divides broadly into two types, namely    yomihon style and kusaz&#333;shi style.    A. In the style used in yomihon , classical words account for seventy   or eighty per cent of the whole in description, and fifty to sixty per cent in   dialogue. It is therefore very simple to adjust descriptions of different ranks   and breeding as occasion demands by using classical diction for an elegant tone   and colloquial vocabulary for the reverse, without the danger of a clash between   description and dialogue. Even Chinese words are occasionally employed to   compensate for deficiencies in our own language, so that passages full of beauty   and grace are delicately shaded in with wabun and gaps in descriptions of   grand and fiery scenes are filled with Chinese expressions chosen for their   vigour. Realistic representations of backwoods scenes may be achieved by   increasing the vernacular content to sixty or seventy per cent. On the other   hand, the proportion of classical content may be boosted to eighty or ninety per   cent to reproduce the speech of the ancient courtiers. I do not think any other   style is as eminently suited to the historical novel. It is not impractical even   in the social novel; but there, perhaps, the kusaz&#333;shi variant of   colloquial style is marginally better, because the rather idiosyncratic dialogue   of yomihon style is often quite different from modern speech, and this   makes it seem more natural not to use it in the social novel. When the blending   of classical and colloquial elements is well handled, this is really the only   style suitable for the historical novel. Getting the proportions right is not   easy, however, and the crudeness of attempts made by amateur would-be authors   can be horrible to behold. I propose now to essay an examination of one or two   of the trouble spots.    One danger lies in leaning too heavily towards a   classical tone, a mistake often made by writers well-versed in classical studies   in their first attempt at yomihon style. Either they concentrate their   attention on grammar, making no effort to distinguish between different ranks in   speech and producing an uneven, unpleasing style; or they think only of rhythm,   so that their work is reminiscent of ch&#333;ka or imay&#333; 13   and often lacks animation. Of course, the presence of a proportion of classical   vocabulary makes it natural to continue using classical Japanese grammar, but to   make this grounds for dwelling on grammar to the exclusion of that portrayal of   human nature and social conditions which is the novel's main concern is totally   unproductive.     The second danger lies in   favouring the colloquial too much. When a writer not very familiar with    wabun rashly attempts to incorporate a large number of colloquialisms   into his text, it often happens that he drifts into a style similar to that used   in j&#333;ruri texts or hauta . 14   The rhythm of the text may be smooth, but the tone is so common it hardly bears   reading. Such works as Segawa Jok&#333;'s 15    Teishinroku are open to this charge.    The combination style is best exemplified in such great novels as    Hakkenden and Bish&#333;nenroku. A few excerpts will suffice to convey   a general idea of it.

They are not   sufficient to reveal it in its entirety, but I think they make clear the ways in   which it differs from the other two styles. As I said earlier, classical words   make up seventy to eighty per cent of the narrative, while their proportion in   dialogue is fifty to sixty per cent, so that there is no marked contrast in tone   between the two and the author may conveniently indicate differences in speech   based on rank, age, or sex, merely by adjusting the ratio. It is this which   makes it the best style for describing both scenes taken from the distant past   and those from all levels of society.    A few points which must be mentioned in any discussion of the yomihon   variant of the combination style are the devices of phonetic and semantic   pivot-words, quotation from classical poetry, and the creation of fanciful   titles.    Phonetically related pivot-words are a variation on the stereotyped epithets   of ch&#333;ka . The technique involves making the second half of a word which   has already expressed one meaning into the first half of the following word. For   example:    &#12373;&#12390;&#12399;&#21629;&#12399;&#28010;&#36895;&#27743;&#12398;&#12289;&#30701;&#12365;&#34310;&#12398;&#34180;&#21629;&#12308; &#12405;&#12375;&#65288;&#31680;&#65289; &#12354;&#12399;&#12379;&#12309;&#12289;&#12354;&#12399;&#12378;&#12394;&#12426;&#12375;&#12434;&#12358;&#12425;&#12417;&#12375;&#12398;&#12289;&#36817;&#27743;&#12308;&#12354;&#12405;&#65288;&#36898;&#65289;&#12415;&#12309;&#12392;&#12399;&#12383;&#12364;&#21517;&#12389;&#12369;&#12445;&#12435;&#12289;&#12373;&#12375;&#12390;&#24448;&#26041;&#12399;&#30952;&#37341;&#12398;&#12289;&#26368;&#12308; &#12356;&#12392;&#65288;&#31992;&#65289; &#12309;&#12418;&#12399;&#12363;&#12394;&#12420;&#21460;&#27597;&#22827;&#12373;&#12408;&#12289;&#12394;&#12365;&#21517;&#32862;&#12375;&#12390;&#24460;&#12293;&#12395;&#12289;&#29289;&#24605;&#12408;&#12392;&#12420;&#12388;&#12428;&#12418;&#12394;&#12365;&#12290;    Sate wa inochi wa Naniha e no, mijikaki ashi no fushi -awase,   awazunarishi o urameshi no, &#332;mi to   hata ga nazukeken, sashite yukuhe wa surihari no, ito mo hakana ya ojigo sahe, nakina   kikashite nochi nochi ni, mono omohe to ya tsure mo naki.    I have underlined several instances of phonetic pivoting in the passage   above. They are probably more a way of limiting the length of the text than mere   attempts at cleverness. Some novice writers, perhaps not realizing this, think   their use is mandatory when in reality they are not so essential. Not using them   at all may result in unpleasantly drawn-out, boring, lustreless prose, but   fitting awkwardly correlated words into inappropriate spots, or triumphantly   producing very clumsy specimens like Toshi wa nij&#363;hachi ka nij&#363;ku karanu,   Y&#333;su wa nanika shirakami mo, Oku no hitoma iriai no, Nan to sen kata namida   nomi --common in j&#333;ruri texts and well-known to women and children--is   most undesirable. It looks bad. Straightforward writing is much better.    Semantic pivot-words involve a slightly different approach. If a writer   thinks a word of similar meaning can be used to reinforce a preceding or   following word, he will contrive to employ it regardless of whether or not there   is any phonetic similarity between the two. In the sentence Kie ni shi hito   wa mutsu no hana, nanatsu ka yattsu o ichigo to shiken , for example,    mutsu no hana derives from kie ni shi . Normally one would just use    yuki; but here, desiring to apply the pivot technique, one uses mutsu   no hana to make the following nanatsu ka yattsu more effective.   Sometimes, depending on where it is used, semantic hingeing serves to keep the   passage concise. More often, though, it is simply a stylistic ornament.    When these two techniques are employed, it should not be obvious that the   author has deliberately twisted his words in order to achieve his effect. As a   general rule, the most important thing in using interrelated words is to manage   the transition smoothly and easily. In other words, they should be so handled   that one reading is enough to show a reader of ordinary intelligence the reason   for the conversion. More elaborate examples, even, should become clear after a   second reading. Otherwise, no matter how clever the shift, the difficulty of   working it out may destroy its effect, which may in turn obscure the meaning of   the entire passage.     A friend   remarked to me that while he agreed that the pivot technique was a brilliant   literary device which imparted a savour to description as yet unknown in Western   writing, he felt that its similarity to word-play made it out of place in   dialogue. In the earlier example, Mijikaki ashi no fushiawase, awazu narishi   o urameshi no, &#332;mi to hata ga   nazukeken , the characters for &#332;mi   are a play on words harking back to au which he believed inappropriate to   such a sad conversation. I answered that in my opinion the use of such a device   was not at all overdone, because the wistful thoughts of a pale, melancholy   young girl confronted by even the names of inanimate objects might suggest just   that sort of thing to her. It is touching. One comes across it often. An early   English poet named Wither 16   once wrote in a poem lamenting the declining fortunes of his house, \"The very   name of Wither shows decay\". In our own country, the last words of Minamoto   Yorimasa 17 as   he sat on the lawn at the By&#333;d&#333;in 18 ,   about to end his life, were Umoregi no hana saku koto mo nakarishi ni, mi no   naru hate zo kanashikarikeru . The word-play here seems to me to express the   poignancy of his emotion better than ordinary words could.    Let me say here that although these devices are meant to keep dialogue short,   as I mentioned earlier, they occasionally have the opposite effect. In    Wakareshi nochi z&#333;ki koto o tsuge no ogushi no tsuguru ma mo naki   yogatari ni naran to wa, omohigakena ya kurokami no kami naranu mi zo   zehi mo naki , tsuge no ogushi and kurokami are not necessary   to the sense. There is no need to use them to lead in to tsuguru and    kami naranu ; all they do is add to the beauty of the text. If they were   eliminated, however, some other way of providing the sparkle which style needs   would have to be found, lest the text should lose its reality for the   reader.    Quotations from classical poetry are most often found in mediaeval fiction,   where parts of old poems were used to fill out and enhance descriptive passages.       &#26376;&#12362;&#12412;&#12429;&#12395;&#12373;&#12375;&#20986;&#12390;&#27744;&#12402;&#12429;&#12367;&#23665;&#12371;&#12406;&#12363;&#12365;&#12431;&#12383;&#12426;&#24515;&#32048;&#12370;&#12395;&#35211;&#12422;&#12427;&#12395;&#12418;&#20303;&#12399;&#12394;&#12428;&#12383;&#12425;&#12435;&#23721;&#12411;&#12398;&#12394;&#12363;&#12362;&#12412;&#12375;&#12420;&#12425;&#12427;&#12290;&#65288;&#12302;&#28304;&#35486;&#12303;&#38920;&#30952;&#12398;&#24059;&#65289;    Tsuki oboro ni sashi idete ike hiroku yama kobukaki watari kokoro bosoge ni   miyuru ni mo sumihanaretaran iwaho no naka oboshi yararu. ( Genji   Monogatari , \"Suma\")    &#34966;&#12414;&#12365;&#12411;&#12373;&#12435; &#20154;&#12418;&#12394;&#12365;&#36523;&#12395;&#12358;&#12428;&#12375;&#12365;&#12371;&#12445;&#12429;&#12374;&#12375;&#12395;&#12371;&#12381;&#12399;&#12392;&#23459;&#12383;&#12414;&#12402;&#12390;&#12290; &#65288;&#12302;&#21516;&#21069;&#12303;&#26411;&#25688;&#33457;&#65289;    Sode maki hosan hito mo naki mi ni ureshiki kokorozashi ni koso   wa to notamahite. ( Ibid , \"Suetsumuhana\")    In the first of the above examples, the words iwaho no naka have been   borrowed from the old poem ikanaran iwaho no naka ni suma ba kawa, yo no   ukikoto no kikoe gozaran . As well as shortening a descriptive sentence, they   carry extra-textual connotations. In the second example, the words sode maki   hosan , taken from the poem awayuki wa kefu wa na furi so shirotahe no   sode maki hosan hito mo aranaku ni , are used to curtail the length of the   dialogue. Chinese poems, too, have often been used in quotations, but I am   unable to think of an example just now. What usually happens is that a character   is first described in as much detail as possible in prose, and then, if   something is still felt to be lacking, the description is supplemented with a   line from an appropriate poem. It is a device often used in Western novels. Some   try for the same effect by inserting a Chinese poem of their own making after a   description of scenery, with the words masa ni kore , but this lacks the   elegance of classical poetry.    The choice of title, of course, is entirely up to the author--he need follow   no prescribed rule. The little I have to say is meant only as a suggestion. To   use two rows of characters like a couplet of poetry as a title, in the manner of   Chinese novels, is dated; but to begin each chapter with a bare number and a   r&eacute;sum&eacute; of its contents is too dull. In the West, quotations from old poems are   occasionally substituted for titles, and some Japanese authors have been known   to use haiku; both methods appeal to me. While any manner of caption will   do, the rubric should be as eye-catching as possible, as it is that which   attracts the reader's attention.    As all my examples of the yomihon style have been drawn from the works   of Bakin, there may be some who misinterpret this to mean that I am advocating   imitation of his style. Such is not at all my intention. I have merely used his   style to illustrate the way in which the classical and colloquial styles can be   blended, without at any time advising taking him as a model. He is indeed a   master of this particular style, but his own special brand of writing is   peculiarly his. No one else can imitate it. The harder they try, the less they   succeed. Writing should be flexible; its only constraint should be that its   classical and colloquial elements be well blended. To concentrate on emulating   Bakin's style will lead to the kind of circumscribed writing I spoke of earlier,   stilted and mannered, as if someone blindfolded had tried to pour water into a   cup. Adjusting the proportion of classical to colloquial is like mixing wine   with water. It is difficult for a blindfolded person pouring wine to judge the   exact amount because he pours it little by little for fear of overfilling the   cup. If he hurries, the wine might overflow and stain the matting. Not to pour   enough is gauche, of course; and stains on the matting are unsightly. When water   is added to the wine, the quantities are the important thing--they should be   adjusted so that the flavour of the wine is not lost. Wine offered to a   non-drinker should be well watered; to a drinking man, much less so. The   proportions, however, are entirely up to the author, who needs no instruction   from anyone else. He should taste and test it himself, using his own discretion   to decide what amounts make the best mix. The wine is classical vocabulary, the   water colloquial. Blending them together in one style is exactly like mixing   wine and water, an idea which should appeal to devotees of the combination   style.      One of my friends once said to me: \"A lot of novelists these   days seem to be fascinated by Bakin. They devote all their efforts to imitating   him, but their styles are starved, gaunt, and in extreme cases dead! How   laughable! Bakin's own marvellous style was a synthesis of the styles of works   like Genji Monogatari , Heike Monogatari , 19    Taiheiki , 20    Suikoden 21   and Saiy&#363;ki . 22 It   was the fruit of his own endeavours. There are times when it is slipshod or   laboured, but because Bakin's facile pen produced those awkward patches in   response to the demands of an occasion, they are sometimes--depending on the   circumstances--more to be praised than condemned. Perhaps that is because his   talent automatically kept them within bounds. But some of today's authors copy   both the good and the bad in him. Perhaps they just do not think about it, or   else they lack his skill. They rejoice in plucking out even the stilted   expressions from his texts and forcing them in after phrases where they do not   belong. Surely they are making a great mistake! What they ought to do, if they   want to learn what style to use in a novel, is go back to Bakin's starting   point, savour great works like Genji Monogatari and Heike   Monogatari and Taiheiki , and then strike out on a new path of their   own. The classics are masterpieces of elegant prose! If authors would only study   them, and blend their styles into a composite, there would be other outstanding   literary talents to praise besides Bakin, whose most successful imitator, even,   could never become more than just a latter-day Bakin without immense effort. A   style synthesized from those of the ancient novels, on the other hand, would   belong to its creator rather than to somebody else--its user could compete with   Bakin, perhaps even outstrip him. Would not that be a more enjoyable prospect?\"   I could not agree with him more.    B. The kusaz&#333;shi variant of the combination style differs from the    yomihon version only in that it has a higher proportion of colloquial   vocabulary than Chinese words. As a result, like the classical style, it   sometimes seems unequal to dealing with sections of description requiring   grandeur of tone. There is no law against using Chinese words, however, and   future users of the style would be within their rights to increase the   proportion as they see fit to overcome such difficulties. The reason they have   been kept to a minimum is probably that the kana text might have made   them difficult to understand. Also, as kusaz&#333;shi were meant as amusements   for women and children, one could say it made sense to use as few as   possible.     There are several varieties of    kusaz&#333;shi style, some quite similar to yomihon style, others   closer to colloquial style. Ky&#333;zan and Tanehiko, for example, wrote their   dialogue in the Ky&#333;to-&#332;saka   colloquial, while Ry&#363;katei Tanekazu 23 or   Mantei &#332;ga 24   used a fairly high proportion of classical diction. The differences will be   obvious if the following examples are read carefully:    &#12381;&#12428;&#12362;&#12381;&#12400;&#12408;&#12392;&#31361;&#36963;&#12425;&#12428;&#12289;&#28145;&#38634;&#12399;&#12399;&#12383;&#12392;&#12371;&#12369;&#12363;&#12445;&#12426;&#12300;&#12510;&#12450;&#20804;&#12373;&#12435;&#12398;&#24746;&#12425;&#12375;&#12356;&#12289;&#26031;&#12358;&#12367;&#12445;&#12425;&#12378;&#12392;&#12418;&#21487;&#12371;&#12392;&#12434;&#12289;&#22072;&#12363;&#12375;&#12362;&#25163;&#12364;&#30171;&#12415;&#12414;&#12379;&#12358;&#12289;&#12406;&#12375;&#12388;&#12369;&#12394;&#12364;&#12425;&#12301;&#12392;&#32080;&#12403;&#30446;&#12398;&#12289;&#22533;&#12365;&#12395;&#27503;&#12414;&#12391;&#12390;&#12388;&#12384;&#12405;&#12390;&#12289;&#28472;&#12293;&#12411;&#12393;&#12369;&#12400;&#27177;&#19977;&#12418;&#12395;&#12388;&#12371;&#12426;&#12300;&#12414;&#12385;&#12364;&#12405;&#12390;&#20854;&#24460;&#12399;&#12289;&#12392;&#12435;&#12392;&#12362;&#30446;&#12395;&#12363;&#12445;&#12426;&#12414;&#12379;&#12396;&#12289;&#20581;&#65288;&#12383;&#12387;&#12375;&#12419;&#65289;&#12391;&#12362;&#30446;&#12391;&#12383;&#12356;&#12289;&#21448;&#12381;&#12398;&#12358;&#12385;&#12395;&#12301;&#12392;&#31435;&#12388;&#12398;&#12434;&#24341;&#12392;&#12417;&#12290; &#65288;&#31278;&#24422;&#65289;    Sore osobahe to tsukiyarare, miyuki wa hata to kokekakari 'maa anisan no   nikurashii, kau kukurazutomo yoi koto o, sazo kashi ote ga itamimaseu,   bushitsukenagara' to musubime no, kataki ni ha made tetsudafute, y&#333;y&#333; hodokeba   gonz&#333; mo nitsukori 'Machigafute sono nochi wa, tonto ome ni kakarimasenu,   osukoyaka de omedetai, mata sono uchi ni' to tatsu no o hikitome.

(Ibid)    Both these passages contain many colloquial words,   words which resemble the old Kansai 25   speech more than that of Edo. As the language of that area is not very far   removed from classical diction, it may be that the author's aim in using it was   to minimize any clash between dialogue and narrative.    &#12356;&#12394;&#65295;&#65340;&#12381;&#12428;&#12399;&#20605;&#35328;&#12394;&#12425;&#12435;&#12289;&#23039;&#12399;&#36046;&#12367;&#12420;&#12388;&#12377;&#12392;&#12418;&#38463;&#22899;&#12399;&#27491;&#12375;&#12367;&#21305;&#23142;&#12395;&#12354;&#12425;&#12378;&#12290;&#12354;&#12414;&#12388;&#12373;&#12408;&#22899;&#23376;&#12395;&#12395;&#12370;&#12394;&#12367;&#12289;&#24515;&#12398;&#12358;&#12385;&#12395;&#22823;&#26395;&#12434;&#12289;&#24605;&#12402;&#12383;&#12388;&#36523;&#12392;&#12415;&#12383;&#12399;&#20731;&#30446;&#12363;&#12290;&#12362;&#12398;&#12428;&#12399;&#24180;&#27604;&#19990;&#12398;&#20154;&#12434;&#12289;&#30456;&#12377;&#12427;&#12371;&#12392;&#12434;&#20462;&#34892;&#12394;&#12375;&#12289;&#20854;&#34899;&#22937;&#12434;&#24471;&#12383;&#12427;&#12422;&#12433;&#12289;&#26368;&#21069;&#12362;&#12371;&#12392;&#12364;&#34903;&#36947;&#12395;&#12289;&#39340;&#12402;&#12365;&#12394;&#12364;&#12425;&#12383;&#12445;&#12378;&#12416;&#12434;&#12289;&#19968;&#30446;&#12415;&#12427;&#12424;&#12426;&#20961;&#20154;&#12394;&#12425;&#12396;&#12289;&#32773;&#12392;&#12399;&#26089;&#12367;&#12418;&#35211;&#26997;&#12417;&#12390;&#12289;&#31363;&#12395;&#21839;&#12405;&#12409;&#12365;&#20107;&#12354;&#12428;&#12400;&#12289;&#12377;&#12445;&#12416;&#12427;&#35328;&#33865;&#12434;&#12373;&#12356;&#12399;&#12402;&#12395;&#12289;&#39340;&#12363;&#12426;&#12358;&#12369;&#12375;&#12418;&#20154;&#12392;&#12384;&#12360;&#12375;&#12289;&#27492;&#12354;&#12383;&#12426;&#12408;&#26469;&#12426;&#12375;&#19978;&#12289;&#32032;&#24615;&#12434;&#21839;&#12399;&#12435;&#28858;&#12382;&#12363;&#12375;&#12290;&#65288;&#20013;&#30053;&#65289;&#12392;&#35328;&#33865;&#12434;&#23613;&#12367;&#12375;&#12390;&#12356;&#12405;&#12434;&#12365;&#12445;&#12289;&#23569;&#22899;&#12399;&#12375;&#12400;&#12375;&#40665;&#28982;&#12383;&#12426;&#12375;&#12364;&#12289;&#12420;&#12445;&#12354;&#12388;&#12390;&#27888;&#28982;&#12392;&#24418;&#12434;&#12354;&#12425;&#12383;&#12417;&#12289;&#32705;&#12395;&#12416;&#12363;&#12402;&#12390;&#12289;&#12362;&#12435;&#36523;&#12364;&#26126;&#23519;&#24863;&#12376;&#20837;&#12427;&#12289;&#26143;&#12434;&#12373;&#12375;&#12383;&#12427;&#20854;&#12371;&#12392;&#12400;&#12289;&#20170;&#12399;&#12388;&#12445;&#12414;&#12435;&#35201;&#12354;&#12425;&#12397;&#12400;&#12289;&#12356;&#12363;&#12395;&#12418;&#23455;&#12434;&#21578;&#12368;&#12409;&#12365;&#12364;&#12289;&#12381;&#12428;&#12424;&#12426;&#20808;&#12365;&#22974;&#12418;&#12414;&#12383;&#12289;&#12362;&#12371;&#12392;&#12395;&#20062;&#12399;&#12435;&#12418;&#12398;&#12371;&#12381;&#12354;&#12428;&#12289;&#12365;&#12445;&#20837;&#12428;&#12390;&#12383;&#12414;&#12405;&#12409;&#12365;&#12420;&#12289;&#12392;&#35328;&#33865;&#12418;&#12395;&#12399;&#12363;&#12395;&#12354;&#12425;&#12383;&#12414;&#12426;&#12290; &#12301;&#65288;&#31278;&#21729;&#65289;    Inaina sore wa itsuwari naran, sugata wa iyashiku yatsusu tomo okoto wa   tadashiku hippu ni arazu.

(Ibid)    It is almost impossible to distinguish the two   passages above from yomihon style. Both the dialogue and the narrative of    Inaka Genji 26   are heavily laced with classical words, perhaps because although    kusaz&#333;shi style incorporates a good deal of modern colloquial, to use the   colloquial alone would be inappropriate for descriptions of life in a much   earlier age.     To sum up: while    kusaz&#333;shi style is the style best suited to novels of modern life, it   still will not do for historical novels. There is something of a gesaku   atmosphere about colloquial dialogue used to represent the speech of those who   lived in the Ashikaga 27 or   H&#333;gen 28   periods--it lacks both the ring of truth and any harmony of sentiment. Not only   that, some parts of the dialogue may prove impossible to express in the modern   idiom, because as human nature and customs have changed over the centuries, so   also have the words in daily use. Even supposing an author were able to use his   talent to camouflage that particular problem, others remain. I see no prospect   of getting rid of them all: When kusaz&#333;shi authors write historical   tales, for example, they usually incorporate into the dialogue of heroes or men   of rank a liberal amount of classical vocabulary items, replacing sonata   with okoto , shikajika share with shikajika shitamae and so   on. In the dialogue of lower-class characters, however, one finds words such as    gozanse and nikurashii . What this amounts to is that the gap   between the by-and-large domestic tone of the lower-class scenes and the   historical tone of the upper-class scenes is so wide that the observant reader   might be forgiven for thinking that the two sets of characters come from   different eras, if not from different countries. Were authors to try to get   around the difficulty by increasing the proportion of classical words in   lower-class dialogue, their style would probably become yomihon style and   the special advantages of kusaz&#333;shi style would be lost, and this would   be a pity.    Still on the same subject, this sort of thing has been   happening quite often in the theatre recently. The play at the Chitose Theatre   is a case in point. In the dialogue of Shizuka Gozen, Yoshitsune's concubine, 29 we   find such expressions as okotora , shikajika ahitsuru zo kashi , the   formal declarative naninani saretari , and the literary shikajika seru   zo ya . Yet the divided lines spoken by a succession of actors and the   dialogue of serving maids in the self-same ky&#333;gen , needless to say in the   scenes of lower-class life, are so vulgar as to bear no resemblance at all to   the speech of Shizuka Gozen. A search would doubtless turn up all manner of   other inconsistencies and irregularities, but because they are part of a play,   they pass virtually unnoticed. Had they appeared in prose, where each could be   subjected to careful perusal and appraisal, they would have diminished the   reader's enjoyment and marred even the most interesting plot. As    kusaz&#333;shi have, until now, been intended solely as entertainments for   women and children, ambiguities within them need cause no particular concern;   but any future author desiring to write a great novel in the kusaz&#333;shi   style will first have to fashion it into a suitable medium for art by   eradicating this problem.    The kusaz&#333;shi style, then, is certainly not   suited to historical novels. It should be reserved for novels of modern manners.   In its present form, however, it cannot properly express the grander aspects of   human nature and social conditions, so that authors will naturally have to use   it carefully and to a certain degree refine it. Actually, historical novels were   the fort&eacute; of the authors of the Bunka-Bunsei 30   period, when many outstanding examples of the genre appeared. A novelist writing   today would find it very difficult to improve on Bakin's masterpieces. He would   do better to abandon that idea and instead devote all his efforts to planning   the best modern novel ever seen. First, of course, he would have to seek out the   most suitable style for such a task and adapt it to meet the demands of the   social novel. The obvious contender is the kusaz&#333;shi style. Perhaps   Japanese novelists of the future will exert themselves to refine it and to   create the perfect modern novel. If slow-witted would-be scholars mock the    kusaz&#333;shi style as being too uncultivated, it is only because they have   failed to understand what the novel really is. The aim of the novel is to make   an impression on its reader by portraying man's nature and customs with total   realism. The presence of colloquial elements in its style, provided that style   itself is sublime, will not rob it of its place alongside painting, music, and   poetry as a great art form.     I might   point out here that although the style of most serials published in the   miscellaneous sections of furigana 31   newspapers recently has been kusaz&#333;shi style, it is a greatly improved   version. The main improvement is the substitution of T&#333;ky&#333; speech for the Kansai   colloquial in dialogue, so that it now resembles colloquial style (Shunsui's   style) more than Tanehiko's style. The change has come about naturally, ever   since T&#333;ky&#333; was made the capital. One contributing factor has been that   newspaper serials, however ridiculous their stories may be, generally treat them   as if they were fact; naturally, therefore, the characters' dialogue must be   written in the contemporary T&#333;ky&#333; colloquial. Meiji authors, however, are not   the first to use the T&#333;ky&#333; vernacular in kusaz&#333;shi . Beginning with the   works of Nise Tanehiko, 32 we   may find many examples of it in the kusaz&#333;shi of Nise Shunsui 33   and others. Social novels in those days, though, rather than being openly   presented as novels of manners, were disguised in historical form, with the   result that some classical diction and some Kansai dialect were mixed in with   the T&#333;ky&#333; idiom. It was by no means Edo speech in its pure form.    Lately, various clubs such as the Kana Club and the   R&#333;maji Club 34   have sprung up here and there. Some people are attempting to reform written   Japanese. While their experiments are both proper and promising, I do not think   that the supremacy of either the kana or the Roman script is really their   ultimate aim. The long-range goal of these kindred spirits is to unify all   countries into one vast republic with as far as possible a common political   system, language, and customs. Their ultimate aims in the event that this   happens can therefore be only to improve the Japanese language and make it the   same as Western languages, or to make Western languages the same as Japanese. As   the civilization of the West is far in advance of ours, of course, to realize   the second of these alternatives would be well nigh impossible, which is why   learned men sympathetic to the idea established the R&#333;maji Club as a   stepping-stone to realizing the first. Now that this has been said, surely it is   obvious that neither the Kana Club nor the R&#333;maji Club is an end in itself, but   a means to an end. The R&#333;maji Club is closely attuned to that ultimate aim--it   therefore seems very natural that scholars and experts should come together to   research the subject. The Kana Club, on the other hand, resembles as it were a   stepping-stone to a stepping-stone, a rehearsal for writing a Roman script. If   that is in truth its purpose, why have its members not set out along an easier   shortcut? Is it not overdoing things to do the same job twice? Surely it is more   imperative to begin devising a new style which can be written in Roman script,   in co-operation with the supporters of romanization. The kusaz&#333;shi style   is the simplest and smoothest--polished up a little, who knows whether it might   not become a fine, thoroughly versatile style? It is far superior in some ways   to the indigestible combination style Kana Club supporters have lately persisted   in using.    I myself am neither a member of the R&#333;maji Club nor an opponent of the Kana   Club. I have led the discussion on to them not by design but by chance. It may   be that I have misunderstood the objectives of the Kana Club, and that they are   not as I have represented them. If so, I trust that its members will not call me   too harshly to account.    Chapter Three    Constructing a plot    A novel is the product of its author's imagination. It follows that unless he   takes meticulous care in planning the construction of its plot, he will end up   with a collection of ideas haphazardly thrown together in an attempt at realism,   his story line disrupted by sequential confusion and his portrait of human   nature obscured by lack of continuity. The cause and effect relationship may be   masked by an over-abundance of incidents, and a satisfactory conclusion impeded   by the presence of too many characters. All these factors naturally make it   vital that he construct his plot in accordance with a predetermined set of   rules.    It is essential when writing a novel to preserve a clear and logical   sequence, so that all incidents, major and minor alike, are connected and not   left dangling. In true stories, travel sketches,and the like, the events related   are essentially not fictitious, and so the constant introduction of new topics   and switches in the focus of the story give the reader the feeling of watching   scenery pass by from a moving carriage. The events of the earlier part are   forgotten halfway through, and with them the prospect of discovering their   outcome as the story switches to completely unrelated matters. New characters   are introduced without their predecessors' fate being fully explained. The   sequence of the whole book is disconnected; only the most cursory attention is   paid to continuity. A novel, on the other hand, must be consistent. No story in   which there is no connection between beginning and end, no relationship between   cause and effect, can be called a novel. It is no more than an absurd piece of   fiction, similar to, but different from, a faithful factual account of social   conditions.     Bakin had this to say about rules   in the novel: 1   \"There are of course structural rules to be seen in the work of Chinese   novelists of the Yuan and Ming dynasties. 2 They   use the techniques of role gradation, adumbration, pre-arrangement, parallelism,   contrast, abbreviation, and allusion.     \"Role gradation is akin to the    shite and waki of recent Noh plays. 3 In   Chinese novels, the protagonist-deuteragonist relationship may remain constant   throughout, or change with each chapter. Occasionally the roles may be reversed.   Adumbration and pre-arrangement resemble each other, but are not the same. The   former involves hinting at events several chapters before they occur, the latter   laying foundations, something known these days as preparation arranging the   beginnings of things in such a way as to yield a clever plot. Jin Rui 4 used   this technique in his commentary on Shui Hu Zhuan .    \"Parallelism is also known as comparison. It means   that, like parallelism in verse, two things are compared with each other and   paired off in the plot. While it may seem redundant, it is not. Redundancy   occurs when an author makes the mistake of repeating an event similar to an   earlier one. Parallelism involves making both a deliberate parallel and a   comparison with the earlier part of the story. Funamushi Obanai's death on the   horns of a cow, for example, parallels the fighting bulls of Hokuetsu Nij&#363;son. Inukai Genpachi's struggle on the   boats moored in the Senj&#363; River, on   the other hand, is in contrast to the struggle on the roof of the Hory&#363;kaku. 5   Although this particular contrast and comparison resemble each other, they are   different. The comparison compares ox to ox--two animals in different situations,   whereas the contrast involves the same person in two different situations.    \"Abbreviation is a device used to reduce the quantity   of text to avoid tedium, by making someone overhear something he has to know, or   having a character explain something in place of a description by the author. It   is meant to shorten the story and prevent the reader's becoming bored. Allusion   is the suggesting of a deeper meaning than the words spell out. Allusions   require considerable hindsight to understand. Shui Hu Zhuan is full of   them--nobody has ever been able to explain them satisfactorily, though many   Chinese men of letters, including of course Li Zhi 6 and   Jin Rui, have toyed with them.\"    The first of Bakin's rules, the protagonist-deuteragonist relationship, I   intend to discuss at length in a separate chapter. What I have to say here   concerns the other six.    Adumbration and pre-arrangement are merely factors in preserving the logical   sequence I mentioned earlier. Most Oriental scholars in the past, despite their   erudition and retentive memories, were unable to sum up broad concepts in a   name--they picked out and named individually the characteristics of certain   sections. Both adumbration and pre-arrangement are meant to ensure a smooth,   connected plot and do not merit separate classification.    Comparison and contrast are too contrived. To pursue this sort of long-winded   novelty too enthusiastically might perhaps result in a distortion of that   description of human nature and social conditions which is the novel's main   concern. These two are techniques for Chinese writers, to whom style is   all-important. Japanese writers need not employ them.    Abbreviation I shall discuss in a separate section on the principles of   description.    Allusion can hardly be said to be essential. Any story which gives a faithful   description of human nature and social conditions and moves the reader to admire   its elegance constitutes a novel, regardless of whether it possesses any   profound extra-textual significance. As failure to do so is in no way   detrimental to the novel, to imply a second, not immediately obvious level of   meaning in any work other than an allegory is no more than a conceit of the   author, a labour of love. Its presence or absence is immaterial.    As I have already said in my introduction to this section, the sole purpose   of rules in the novel is to keep the reader interested. Once this is clearly   understood, no more detailed explanation is necessary, but I shall nevertheless   press on for the future benefit of our own authors, who as yet possess only a   rudimentary knowledge of such matters.    The first thing to be dealt with in any discussion of   plot is the difference between comedy and tragedy. (Tragedies and comedies may   be called in Japanese hiai sh&#333;setsu and kaikatsu sh&#333;setsu   respectively.) The tragic novel I have already touched on in the first section   of this work. A comic novel restricts itself to light-hearted matters and   abounds in jokes and witticisms. The comic novel of today is vastly different   from that of the days when what then passed for comic novels attempted to hold   society up to ridicule by depicting only laughable, ludicrous antics. Besides   not always aspiring primarily to jokes and puns, it sometimes even incorporates   into its plot a dash of pathos. Hakkenden and Yumiharizuki 7   provide examples of modern comedies on the home front. The final scene in a   comic novel finds the hero safe and prosperous. In a tragedy, however, he meets   an untimely death as the end approaches. Modern novelists, to avoid monotony,   occasionally spice even tragic novels with jokes or cheerful topics, so that   there is no longer any clearcut distinction between tragedy and comedy--many   so-called comedies, in particular, are not funny at all. That is why a certain   English scholar not long ago styled novels like Hakkenden and    Yumiharizuki tragi-comedies. The description is probably apt.     The one   thing to be avoided above all else in a purely comic novel is a pornographic   plot. Sometimes authors with little self-respect stoop to obscenity to raise a   laugh when hard-pressed for humorous material--witness Ikku's Hizakurige 8 and   Kinga's Shichi Henjin , 9 both   of which are outstanding among pre-Restoration novels but fall far short of the   standards of the true novel because of their high content of bawdy dialogue.   Dickens's Pickwick Papers 10 is   pure comedy--it is full of witticisms, but contains no hint of indecency in   either plot or language, because wit is not founded on bawdiness. The secret of   humour lies in cleverly mixing solemnity, pride, and nobility with stupidity,   meanness, and coarseness. One way to raise a laugh is to exaggerate the   insignificant or to exalt the lowly. An old retainer's absent-mindedness, the   downfall of a haughty person--this is the stuff of which comedy is made. In   short, the seeds of laughter are often to be found in situations arising from   unintentional mistakes. There is no need to make a joke of coarseness.    The novel of the future will not be like that of the past. It will set out to   attract men of discrimination rather than to entertain women and children. This   means, of course, that even humorous novels will have to avoid plots unworthy of   an artist's standards. Just as an indecent painting unfit for the eyes of family   groups cannot be classified as art, no matter how skilful its execution, so too   a book which cannot be read aloud to parents and children is not a real novel.   Someone once said that there would be no pornographic literature if public   demand did not ensure a ready sale for it, and that it is thus the readers and   not the authors who are to blame if novels are bawdy. Authors merely describe   human nature and social conditions appropriate to the times. If their   contemporaries are low-minded, if they delight in eroticism, then that will   naturally be reflected in the novels of the day. It is inevitable, he said,   because the novel is a mirror of its times!    His argument is reasonable in the main, but not altogether incontrovertible.   What he says was true of pre-Meiji novelists, whose aim was to entertain women   and children with their work, but it will not do as a justification for their   modern counterparts. As a general rule, there is a line which should not be   crossed in dealing with the seamy side of life. While some aspects of it must   inevitably form part of any description of human nature and social conditions,   others should never be mentioned. Those that are unavoidable should be handled   with care. They should be dealt with as briefly as possible, and the rest left   to the reader's imagination. In times when morals are lax, for example, many men   and women carry on clandestine intrigues, but to lay bare the mysteries of the   bedroom and reproduce the details of their conversation there in the name of   realism is a task belonging not to the novelist but to the writer of   love-stories.    What I have just said applies to comic novels as well. Surely it is not   really necessary to take their subject matter from the lower classes of society   when the people and affairs of the upper classes provide such rich material for   humour! It is understandable that gesaku writers of the Ikku school, who   of course were not very highly principled, should have drawn their material from   middle and lower class life to amuse their lower class readers. What I find   really amazing, however, is that today's comedy writers, rather than striking   out in a new direction, continue to use the same old methods and still consider   bawdy jokes the pinnacle of humour. None of them is interested in reshaping the   Japanese novel into an art form!    As long as the novel is not considered to be art, it need do no more than   provide contemporary readers in a given area with entertainment. Not even the   most contemptible story, the most erotic tale, can be criticized. If, on the   other hand, one looks upon the novel as a great art form, it will take more than   the mere fact that a story has the power to interest people in a certain place   and time to earn it that description. As I said in Part One, true art is   beneficial--it moves a man deeply and ennobles his character without his being   aware of it. Anything which lacks even the least part of this benefit is not art   but merely a commonplace diversion. Can the coloured woodblock prints, in which   the public delight, be classified as real painting? They are beautiful,   certainly, but it would be wrong to label them indiscriminately as embodiments   of the pure essence of art, when their eligibility for such a description must   depend on whether or not they have the ability to enrich a man's nature.     As the   artist must strive to paint not merely a pretty picture but one so beautifully   executed that it ennobles the human character in some way, so too the novelist   must strive to inspire his reader by the vividness of his portrayal of human   nature and social conditions. No novel which fails to uplift its reader ranks as   art, nor does its author deserve the proud title of novelist. If hesitant   authors choose to deprecate themselves as being only Meiji authors, or Bunsei 11    gesaku writers, and try to repudiate the title, refusing to consider   themselves artists, I do not blame them at all, no matter how much they pander   to the interests of children or the lower classes. It is of no consequence. To   amuse people in a given time or place is a simple matter; to create an   impression on a larger scale is much more difficult. To take an instance from   the world of ukiyoe; Hishikawa Moronobu 12   was a pioneer in their development, second only to Iwasa Matabei. 13   Because of that, he was famed throughout the country in his day. Everyone   acknowledged him a master. Yet the artists of the world would surely not   acquiesce in praising the extremely bad ukiyoe produced by the followers   of that same Hishikawa as masterpieces of elegance. To do so would be to confuse   elegance with antiquity. Their example shows how easy it is to win localized,   contemporary approval, and how difficult true art is!    What I have just said must not be construed as advice to the novelist to   ignore contemporary human nature and social conditions and confine himself to   writing instead about a nobler kind supplied by his imagination. Any historical   novel must inevitably contain passages dealing with violence and cruelty. Even a   social novel, if its author lived in a society as yet only semi-civilized, would   be an idealized rather than true picture of life in its times. The best way to   deal with them, I feel, is to include them, but to exercise restraint in their   handling. If an author feels even the slightest twinge of personal interest in a   brutal episode, he will be apt to dwell on the incident to an extent unpalatable   to some other perceptive, detached person. The same applies to pornography--any   eagerness on an author's part to divulge such details becomes obvious from the   way he writes about them, causing discriminating readers to lay aside the   book.    To sum up: while it is not necessary to banish all   mention of cruelty or obscenity from the novel, such elements should be kept to   a minimum. The intelligent reader should not be wearied with the sort of   thoroughly squalid tale hitherto produced by Japanese authors. In the works of   the French novelist Dumas, one encounters both barbarity and eroticism, but as   he does not expose in full the secrets of the bedroom, unlike our own historical   romances, his novels may safely be read aloud to whole families. Many of the   works of the English novelist Lytton-- Ernest Maltravers , 14   for example--also relate stories of love, but he too handles such matters   differently from Japanese novelists. The bedroom itself, of course, and any   details of such private matters are kept entirely out of the picture. Nothing is   made explicit. Instead, Lytton turns his facile pen to exploring every detail of   his lovers' ardent emotions. His love stories, from the nature of the story to   the handling of the plot, resemble those of the Tamenaga school, but they   escaped a scornful reception from the English public not only because of the   superior nature of their characters and incidents but also because of the   elegance of his method of description in dwelling not on specific behaviour but   on abstract emotions. Future Japanese novelists would do well to make this   distinction in their new works.    I might just mention here the subject of rape, which occasionally crops up   either in passing in the plot of Japanese novels or as the main topic of a   historical romance. Human nature and social conditions being what they are, its   presence is attributable to them rather than to any fault on the author's part,   but it does not enhance the plot in any way. If its omission would detract from   the realism of the description, then it must be included, but there is surely no   need to describe it frankly as an end in itself. There are many ways of skirting   the subject--by making one character tell another that it happened, for example,   thereby sidestepping the prurient details. This would be quite a novel method,   one which would do justice to both points of view. There are many other such   ways to improve a plot. When Japanese novelists want to shed light on the way   men and women think, they invariably progress to bedroom matters. This above all   else must be stopped. I refer to such phrases as \"although they do not yet sleep   together\" and \"at first they were afraid and shy, but later they became joyous   bedfellows\". Such things need not be put into words. Expressions like \"slamming   shut the door, what dreams they must have dreamed together\" are always to be   found in our novels. They may be worded in any one of a variety of ways, but   their implication is always deliberately sexual. This is going too far. If an   author wishes to make it tacitly understood that the characters in his story are   engaging in illicit sex, he should be able to communicate it from the context   without needing to mention doors being closed!    In this connection, it may be said that many recent    sewa-ky&#333;gen 15   have had mediocre plots and little artistic appeal. This is because of the lack   of ability of the basically unimaginative authors. They have abandoned brutal,   erotic plots in response to the arguments of thinkers seeking to bring about the   enlightenment of society, but have had no idea of the kind of pure, carefully   crafted plots that should be substituted. All they have done is serve up dull   offerings which are simply ordinary ky&#333;gen from which the erotic elements   have been removed. Sewa-ky&#333;gen these days are neither accurate portrayals   of modern social conditions nor representations of an ideal society. As the   events they describe have obviously been contrived by the author, they contain   such unlikely incidents as the miraculous recovery of a man who should have   died, or the reform of an incorrigible villain. In short, modern ky&#333;gen   offer neither well-turned and accurate descriptions of contemporary life nor   elegant climaxes wherein are expressed deeply felt emotions; lacking both, they   naturally have nothing in them to interest us.    Let me now return to my original subject of the comic novel, from which I   have digressed at some length. I have a little more to say about today's   so-called comic novel, or tragi-comedy, as it really is.    In tragi-comedy, it is the blending of humour and pathos which demands the   most careful attention. There is as a rule a limit to how much the sensibilities   can be taxed, just as the muscles or the power of observation grow tired and   weak and temporarily cease to function if used for too long without a break.   After staring too long into the radiance of the sun, for example, we cannot see   even the light of a candle; and even the strongest perfume seems to have as   little impact as water to a nose grown accustomed to its fragrance after   prolonged exposure. Likewise the sensibilities too can be blunted--too many   tragic stories will result not only in a gradual weakening of the ability to   empathize but also eventually in boredom. For this reason it has long been the   custom among authors to season tragedy with laughter and comedy with dashes of   hardship and misery in order not to weary their readers. I do not have the space   to explain it all over again, but there is one cautionary note I must sound on   the subject. Humour and pathos in a tragi-comedy should not be alternated in a   mechanical way with none of the charm of the unexpected or they will make little   impression on the reader, no matter how well the proportion of each is   regulated. They should be used judiciously.    The same applies to tragic novels. Should they   encompass nothing but misery and sadness from beginning to end, on the grounds   that such should be the primary concern of a tragedy, their readers will   eventually become bored. The final catastrophe, in particular, should be   described simply, with the lightest possible touch. Look at the famous love   story Musume Setsuy&#333; 16 --its   d&eacute;nouement is the more unbearably   poignant for being so delicately handled. Murasaki Shikibu, in the \"Kumogakure\"   chapter of Genji Monogatari , informs the reader in a roundabout way that   Genji is dead. The care she takes to do so marks her as a great writer.    There is much more I ought to say about the plot of the tragic novel, but as   I have already gone on too long I propose to turn now to other matters. I trust   my readers will forgive me for not taking this section to its conclusion.    Here follows as a guide for authors a list--not exhaustive, of course--of the   main faults to be avoided in the plot of a novel. They will from time to time   discover others, which they should take their own measures to avoid.    1. Fantasy    I shall not go over this ground again, as I have already explained repeatedly   that the true novel shuns absurd nonsense and fanciful extremes of mystery.    2. Monotony    By monotony, I mean constant repetition of the same sort of idea. Music and   poetry are nothing without rhythm. Variety is even more important in the novel,   which catalogues the infinite, ever-changing spectrum of human nature and social   conditions.    3. Redundancy    Redundancy is the repetition of an idea similar to one expressed earlier. As   it is a matter often debated with great heat by Japanese novelists, the reader   is probably already familiar with the arguments without my joining the fray.    4. Eroticism    I have discussed this point several times already. Eroticism is to be   avoided, but not to the extent of never mentioning liaisons between the sexes. I   merely expect that an author should not seek personal gratification by writing   of the secrets of the bedroom.    5. Favouritism    This really applies to characterization rather than plot, but I shall take   the opportunity to mention it now. By favouritism, I mean the attitude of an   author towards the characters he has created. It may seem rather odd to speak of   taking sides in connection with characters who are wholly imaginary, but such   being the way human nature works, it is not really strange at all. An author may   grow unconsciously attached to a virtuous character, for example, and twist the   plot to allow his behaviour to continue unblemished when the thread of the   narrative really dictates that that person act dishonestly. Or he may sometimes   so arrange things that a villainous character is made to perform all manner of   wicked deeds.      Biographers as well as novelists have been known to indulge   in favouritism. Ieyasu's 17   biographer, recounting the battle of &#332;saka, would naturally defend Ieyasu's   actions, whereas Toyotomi's 18   biographer, describing the same event, would favour Hideyori and his mother and   revile the behaviour of Ieyasu and his son. If this can happen in histories,   which ought to present the unvarnished facts, what hope is there for the novel?   A novelist may speak good or ill of his characters as he pleases. He is free to   portray the behaviour of the main object of his affections, the revered hero, as   good and pure in every particular, or conversely, to paint the villain utterly   black. Should he allow himself a biased attitude, therefore, Meiji society would   see the appearance of a crowd of men as holy as the saints, who could put Yao   and Shun to shame, and of villains so pitiless and cruel they would strike fear   into the hearts of Dao Zhi 19   and Jie and Zhou. 20   Japanese authors in the past have shown a marked tendency towards favouritism.   No writer whose guiding principle is to observe life as it is and write about it   in strictly realistic terms ought to have such a bad habit, but as they pander   to the frivolous tastes of women and children it is inevitable that such bias   will occur. Women and children, simple creatures that they are, probably think   that heroes are always good and villains always bad. In reality, however, even   heroes are sometimes prey to evil passions, and even villains sometimes stirred   by conscience. If an author loses sight of this fact even for an instant in the   process of peopling his novel, his characters will not ring true. Take care!    6. Patronage     Patronage too relates to   characterization. It occurs as a result of the favouritism just mentioned. When   an author takes his partiality for his hero to extremes, he shelters him and   saves him from every threatened danger. The practice is not wrong in itself, of   course, since it is only in tragic novels that the hero must die, but things   have been very badly managed if the reader takes it for granted that the hero   will always be over-protected and rescued from peril. The eight heroes of    Hakkenden , for example, are wizards who encounter no difficulties and   never die. Inue no Masashi, 21 in   particular, does not die even though he is killed, perhaps because he has the   aid of a sacred rosary bead as well as of the divine spirit of the guardian   angel Fusehime. Thanks solely to Bakin's literary talent, this defect goes   unremarked throughout the novel. Any other author would have had the reader   yawning and throwing the book away by the eighth or ninth chapter. Some English   novelists--Richardson, 22   for example--are guilty of patronage.    7. Inconsistency    I address myself here to both plot and description.   Let me give an example. Shint&#333; Suikoden 23   was begun by Gakutei and continued by Chisokukan. Any inconsistencies are   therefore excusable on the whole, but there is one particularly glaring   discrepancy which makes a good example because of the unpleasant jolt it gives   the reader. Gakutei describes Tamaoki Genkur&#333; as swarthy, powerfully built, and   round-eyed, whereas Chisokukan, much later, says that he is pale-complexioned   with a straight nose. An astounding contradiction indeed! Of course, Tamaoki   first appears in the story as a woodcutter deep in the mountains, so it is quite   natural that he should appear dark, but it ought to be explained that this is   the result of exposure to the sun. No matter how many years have passed, a   rough, uncouth woodcutter cannot be transformed into an elegant Adonis. Too many   such inconsistencies will weary the reader and take the edge off even the most   interesting plot.    8. Ostentatious scholarship    Ostentatious scholarship--the flaunting of one's own   erudition--is seldom seen in the work of experienced writers. It is younger   authors who are often guilty of this abominable practice--they launch into   lengthy accounts of past events when danger threatens, and give lectures on   archaic words in front of their betters who cannot speak out, or they give a   character more learning than he might reasonably be expected to have. The most   frequent sinner in this regard among Japanese novelists was Bakin. The practice   crops up occasionally in some of Lytton's earlier works, and even Scott is said   to have yielded to the temptation to some extent in The Pirate , 24   for which he was trounced by the critics. Nonetheless, it would be a great pity   if an author's learning were to pass completely unnoticed. He should take care   to limit his display of it to occasions when the text of his novel calls for it,   so as not to bore his reader.    9. Too long a story    I am not referring here to the story as a whole. There is nothing wrong with   writing a long story, so long as an author provides enough variety in its plot   to keep his reader's interest. If he delays the progress of the story   interminably in the manner of a professional storyteller, however, the impatient   reader may grow tired of waiting and lose all interest in the outcome. The   impact of the denouement will be diminished because his attention will probably   have wandered to something else by the time it is produced.    The following amusing anecdote illustrates my point.   Not long ago, a certain prostitute from a brothel in the Shin'yoshiwara 25   took a handsome lover. The lover, thinking to cement their relationship even   further by a trick, deliberately kept his distance for a time in an attempt to   increase her longing for him. For more than ten days, he paid her no visit.   Meanwhile the woman, who had forsaken her trade for love of him and was even   ready to marry him, was in torment imagining various accidents which might have   befallen him. She tried to find out what had happened by sending people to spy   on his movements, or sending anonymous letters, but he smiled to himself to see   his plan in action and from then on only returned commonplace answers once or   twice a month. Eventually he sent not even a postcard. Three or four months   passed in this way. The woman, who was in any case of a jealous disposition,   thought he had transferred his affections elsewhere. She seemed to feel the   first cold breath of an unexpected autumn wind. Jealousy tore at her. Try as she   might, she could not forget the words of love they had exchanged in the past. In   the months which had already passed, even when dressed to receive patrons, an   unceasing rain of unseen tears had soaked her sleeve. When still not even the   faintest whisper of a message came from her lover, however, she untied the knot   of the wanton, fickle thread of a courtesan's love which bound them and entered   into a close alliance with another lover. Meanwhile, her former lover had no   idea what had happened. When the four months were up, he told himself that the   time was ripe. Planning to meet her that very day and play out a fine stormy   scene which would be by turn sad and humorous, he went triumphantly to visit   her--with what little success the reader may deduce for himself! Had this   self-assured paramour practised his delaying tactics in moderation, all would   probably have been well. He failed because he did not appreciate this fact,   which is also a key to the novel. Novelists, I implore you, keep his example in   mind when you write!    10. Lack of poetic interest    This is not at all the term I am looking for, but it will do for the moment.   What I really mean is lack of dramatic sense. Because the novel is a faithful   reproduction of social conditions, its plot is apt to be plain and insipid. To   avoid this, a novelist should strive to keep his reader's interest by weaving   occasional touches of the romance into his plot--a secret feud, for example. I   need not elaborate further.    11. Making characters relate long personal histories    This device not only helps to keep the story short, it has a charm of its   own. It can be used without overdoing things two or three times in a long novel,   but used too often it will provoke sighs of \"Not again!\" from the reader. In   works of only a few chapters, especially, the less it is used the better.    That concludes my remarks on the subject of plot in general. There remain   several things to be said about the plot of the historical novel, however, which   I shall deal with in a separate chapter to avoid making this one too long.    Chapter Four    The   Plot of the Historical Novel    Before going on to discuss plot, I propose to say a little about the   difference between a historical novel and a history, because unless that   difference is clearly understood, the historical novel will not be easy to   write. I trust the reader will forgive me if I seem to repeat arguments already   covered in earlier sections.     There are some who say that   although many people read historical novels for pleasure because they fill in   the gaps left by official histories, they would lose their attraction were   histories to develop to such a stage of thoroughness that we could assume there   were no omissions. Such an event, they claim, would mean the eventual demise of   the novelist, who expends his energies on fanciful original fictions. Even   Macaulay himself, it appears, felt the same way--he often put forward a similar   idea in his works, and talked about why writers of novels and historical   romances would ultimately disappear. \"It is not only students and scholars who   enjoy finding out the details of their country's past. Even laymen take a   certain amount of pleasure in reading history, which of course is as it should   be. How can they amuse themselves with the fictions of novels alone?\" Surely he   is mistaken: There is a vast--more than vast--difference between the so-called   authentic histories found in England and what pass for chronicles in the Orient,   of course, but it is hard to believe that, as matters now stand, outside   literary circles a historian's literary style can have more appeal than a   novelist's. An aptitude for writing history being essentially different from a   talent for poetry or fiction, the two are never found in the same person.   Macaulay was a talented historian, of course, with a flair for poetry as well.   There can be little doubt, however, that had he been commanded to write a novel   or a historical romance it would have been clumsy and undistinguished. Lord   Brougham, 1 a   prominent English historian, actually did write a few novels, but their unwieldy   plots and ungraceful style rendered them hardly fit to read. Novelists, on the   other hand, suffer no such handicap. Quite a few famous novelists have also   written famous histories. Thackeray is one eminent figure whose novels have   brought him prominence in recent times. I have heard that on several occasions   he produced manuscripts for a history, but dropped the project before   publication. I am firmly convinced that had he seen it through, the result would   have been brilliant. The Four Georges and The English Humourists 2   prove beyond doubt that his is no ordinary historian's talent. George Eliot was   similarly gifted; and Lord Lytton actually wrote several sections of a history   which were well received.    Before I go any further, I shall spell out just what it   is that distinguishes a novelist from a historian. In the first place, a   novelist's penchant for fiction makes him reluctant to record facts in a plain,   unvarnished manner. Without consciously realizing it, he introduces a certain   amount of literary embellishment, and occasionally gets his facts wrong. Lapses   into rhetoric are often unavoidable, however, when the topic under discussion is   a person. Even Macaulay, both in his histories and his biographies, occasionally   set down seemingly fanciful, questionable information. Carlyle, 3 who   enjoys a considerable reputation in England, was another whose style was   exceedingly ornate. It is therefore difficult to distinguish between novelist   and historian solely on the grounds that one writes fiction and the other fact.   Such masters of the historical novel as Sir Walter Scott always based their   plots on historical fact, but one reading is enough to make apparent the   difference between their works and the history books. It is not just attention   to detail or ornateness of style which sets the two apart, but the fact that a   novel can both smooth over the gaps left in histories by supplying missing facts   from the author's imagination and also indulge freely in familiarity, by which I   mean that when a novelist describes the words and actions of his characters (who   are also historical figures) with meticulous attention to detail, he creates in   his reader the impression that the novelist and the character as represented in   the novel are well known to each other. A historian narrating facts must   substantiate every incident. Not so a novelist, who is at liberty to perform the   by no means easy task of dissecting human nature as he pleases, to trespass   within even the forbidden inner sanctums of court ladies in order to give an   account of how those ladies behave there, and to describe what is happening both   inside and outside closed gates and doors, without having to go into the   background of events in any detail.     The most important of the   differences between a novel and a history is this ability of the novel to fill   in gaps. Think, for example, about the fact that the Emperor Napoleon I of   France 4   finished his evening meal. No doubt he did finish it, and so he should have, but   that point is far too trivial to record in a history. Everyone who has ever read   a history of France has imagined that many a melancholy conversation must have   preceded the Emperor's divorce from the Empress Josephine, 5 yet   anyone attempting to set down every one of the details which go to make up each   event in a history book would be bound to attract criticism on the grounds of   over-complexity. These small facts, however, make a deep impression on people.   It is precisely because many such trifling matters are pinpointed in unofficial   histories and pamphlet histories that readers lap them up. Having no more   cherished memories of Napoleon the man than the next person, they are delighted   by the feeling of intimate contact afforded by finding out any contemporary   information about him. It is very difficult, indeed impossible, to escape the   charge of superfluity incurred by recording such minutiae in official histories,   however, unless the historian possesses an outstanding literary talent.    The novelist, on the other hand, is under no such constraint. In order to   relate Napoleon's story, and to deal fully with the events leading up to his   marriage to Marie Louise after his divorce from Josephine, he begins with a time   and place of no particular importance and proceeds to fill in the full picture   by stages, luring the reader ever onward to a marvellous climax and causing him   to feel that past events have come alive before his eyes. All this lies within   his competence! From a novel of this kind, a reader learns that Napoleon sat   drinking coffee and chatting with the maids and pages in the depths of the   palace, what his responses were, what the maids said to him, and why certain   topics upset him. Not only does he find out how the Empress Josephine swallowed   the bitterness overflowing her heart and restrained her crushing grief, often   brushing away with her sleeve the tears in her eyes, but even the small things   are revealed in every particular--how the coffee grew cold as the conversation   lengthened, why the bread and butter were left on the table to no purpose with   no-one to eat them, how someone forced herself to eat just a slice solely to   keep up appearances. To report every single one of these details in a history   would be impossible. That is the fort&eacute; of the novel!    It is also very difficult to sketch in such things as   clothing and customs in a history, whereas not only does a novelist have every   facility to do so, his work is tantamount to a living history of manners.   Authors like Scott come closest to achieving a true historical novel. While   Bakin, Ky&#333;den, and others are famous as historical novelists, their works are   really more like social novels, perhaps because they carelessly described not   the customs and clothing appropriate to the historical setting but those of the   Kan'ei period 6 and   after.     The most   important thing to remember in writing a historical novel is to keep as much as   possible to the background of history rather than to its surface. By surface, I   mean the facts recorded in history books; by background, things which cannot be   discovered from that source. Bakin's very clever description of the appearance   of the H&#333;gen army in Yumiharizuki 7   comes close to achieving the effect of a fictional biography. Also very clever   is his ferreting out and detailed describing of all H&#333;j&#333; Tokimasa's 8   inner wickedness in Asaina Shima Meguri no Ki . It is probably even true   to say that Ky&#333;kakuden 9 and    Bish&#333;nenroku qualify as outright historical novels from this point of   view.    To sum up: the aims of the historical novel are to fill in gaps in both   histories and histories of manners. To attain even one of these goals is   sufficient. While an author is under no compulsion to use the great events and   characters of history, a story centred on historical fact backed up wherever   possible with accounts of customs and reminiscences is truly whole and   perfect.    Authors of historical novels are prone to many weaknesses, of which the chief   are chronological inconsistencies, factual errors, and misrepresentation of   customs.    Even historians sometimes make mistakes in chronology. While slight errors   may not seem a matter for any great concern in novels, which are fictitious,   they are nevertheless undesirable and should be eliminated wherever possible,   because regardless of how elegant and realistic the story may be, a perceptive   reader will notice marked discrepancies at once and lose the feeling that he has   entered a dream world and is communing with the ancients. Japanese novelists in   the past have not placed much importance on chronological inaccuracies. Some   have even openly advised their readers not to worry about them. Others like   Bakin, as might be expected, paid scrupulous attention to dates, so that those   who call Hakkenden and Shima Meguri no Ki historical novels are   not really so far wide of the mark. I recall, however, that there were quite a   few mistakes in Ky&#333;kakuden, an outstanding work.    Factual errors involve making mistakes in historical data--describing a good   man as a villain, for example, or vice versa. Japanese novelists are often   guilty of this crime, although some like Bakin have done their best to avoid it.   It must certainly be eliminated because the main purpose of the historical novel   is to relate behind-the-scenes information about historical events and   personages: this of course it cannot do with any degree of conviction if the   external facts on which its story is based are inaccurate. No historical novel   is perfect as long as it contains such errors, no matter how clever its plot or   accurate its description of customs. A story dealing fully with customs but   based on fictitious characters with no recourse at all to historical fact would   be preferable.     An   author misrepresents customs by describing anachronistic utensils, furnishings,   customs, ornaments, or foodstuffs, or by taking for granted in the story customs   which did not exist in that era--making an Ashikaga period character smoke   cigarettes or play the samisen , for example, or one from the H&#333;j&#333;   period 10   fire a gun or wield a lance. A further instance of this sort of carelessness   would be to have a woman of the Keich&#333; era 11 do   up her hair in a shimada topknot, 12 or   wear a kimono with long, trailing sleeves. There are other much worse cases--I   mention these only by way of example. Inaccurate reporting of customs, like the   inclusion of factual errors mentioned earlier, is a grave fault in a historical   novel, one which, if not eliminated, will prevent the realization of its goals.   How unfortunate it is that even a great writer like Bakin not only sinned   frequently in this respect but made no attempt whatever to reform!    Chapter Five    The   Hero    The hero is the central character of the novel. He may also be called the   idol. While there is no restriction on how many heroes a novel may   have--sometimes there is only one, sometimes more than two--there must be at least   one, because without him the continuity it needs would be totally lacking.    Because the novel, dealing as it does with human nature, must of course   express the views of both sexes, the central character may be either male or   female, designated hero and heroine respectively. A simple example of such a   pair occurs in Bakin's Ky&#333;kakuden , where Koroku Sukenori is the hero and   Kusunoki Komahime the heroine. I need not elaborate further.    Historical romances with intricate plots sometimes have   many sets of central characters. In Lytton's Rienzi , 1 Nina   is paired with Rienzi, Irene with Adrian, and Adeline with Montr&eacute;al.    Occasionally a novel may have a hero but no heroine, or   vice versa. Yoshihide, hero of Asaina Shima Meguri no Ki , has no female   counterpart, while Cui Qiao, heroine of Cui Qiao Ji (adapted by Bakin as    Kingyoden ), 2   lacks a male partner. These two examples are not really satisfactory; however,   as nothing better suggests itself to me just now, they will serve my purpose for   the time being.    Sometimes there are many heroes present at the same time, as in    Hakkenden , Shima Meguri no Ki , &#332;uchi Jissanden , Nishi   Ky&#363;gy&#363;shiden , and Shui Hu Zhuan . In novels of this kind, however, the   heroes are naturally ranked, one being as it were the central hero--Asaina in    Shima Meguri no Ki , and Rienzi in Rienzi .    Here follow a few examples to help those not familiar with these ideas.     Shiranui Monogatari 3    hero Aoyagi Harunosuke    heroine Wakanahime    Jiraiya Monogatari 4    heroes Ogata Sh&#363;ma    Orochimaru    heroine Tsunade    Bish&#333;nenroku    hero Sue Harukata    heroine Kogane    Yumiharizuki    hero Tametomo    heroine Shiranuihime    Japanese novels often do not make clear just who is a hero and who is not.   Kohata Nobuyuki and Inaba Onikado are the central heroes of Shint&#333; Suikoden ; the others are secondary   heroes.    Most people, reading a novel, are wont to pay more   attention to the character of its hero than to the possible outcome of its plot.   A hero above the common run of men elicits respect and a desire to know what   will happen to him. As well as fashioning a clever plot, therefore, it is also   necessary to provide a distinguished hero capable of stimulating the reader's   interest. He need not always be a man who combines wit and good looks with   virtue. So long as he possesses unusual qualifications which will impress and   interest the reader, the central character may even be an ugly villain such as   the heroes of Bish&#333;nenroku and Jin Ping Mei , or an ill-favoured   woman like Kakine Oiwa. 5   Mean, foolish characters or cowards should be avoided, however, because not only   do they fail to attract the reader, they are highly likely completely to destroy   his interest in the story of their misdeeds. Such heroes are sometimes very   successful in comic novels, so there is no reason not to use them in that   sphere; but serious novels should avoid them wherever possible.     I said just   now that an author may make his hero ugly and wicked if he wishes. Should he do   so, however, he must also introduce a good hero to provide as much contrast as   possible. In Bish&#333;nenroku , Bakin used Mori Shir&#333; Masakatsu as a foil for   the wicked Sue Akenosuke. The filial Shidoroku in My&#333;my&#333; Guruma 6   contrasts with the bad son Madoroku, and Shirayama Yukiwaka in Jidai   Kagami 7 with   Fujinami Yukari. All of them are born of this need, mainly because variety is   essential to the plot. The plot of the novel, as indeed do all fine arts,   requires a heterogeneous design and a coherent plan. Even a scrupulously careful   plot with a clearly connected sequence throughout will not stop a reader from   eventually wearying of and abandoning a tale with no variety of ideas, where the   doings of ugly, evil characters fill every chapter, or the only descriptions are   of despicable, mean-spirited scoundrels. On the first day the head of a   condemned man is exposed on a gibbet, men and women of all ages and ranks fall   over each other to get there. They gather like ants to gaze upon the dreadful   face. After a few days, though, all alike frown upon it, and hardly anyone looks   at the head, let alone the gibbet. The human appetite for the curious being very   strong, man takes pleasure in a thing's novelty regardless of its merits or   appearance, but very rarely does he cherish ugliness and evil more than beauty   and goodness. Indeed, he is born with a love of beauty--a passion for ugliness is   merely a reaction, an anomaly, whose essential irregularity makes its   fascination shortlived. That is why the novel cannot do without both a good and   a bad hero. Aoto no Sekibun was written by Bakin's acquaintance Kingyo 8 and   checked over by Bakin. Neither its style nor its design is ill-devised, but such   is the unmitigated villainy of its unsympathetic main characters that the reader   has no inclination to continue past the first three or four parts. Every single   character, from the hero Nakusa Gekisai (who overthrew Murai Ch&#333;an) and the   heroine Oreki to the others, is a contemptible bandit whose every action serves   only to fill the reader with disgust. Kumano Tanz&#333; alone among them has an   upright character, but his goodness is not of an order to match the wickedness   and cruelty of Gekisai and the others. The book falls down on this point. It is   a serious weakness, which authors should ordinarily take pains to avoid.    There are two schools of thought on the matter of inventing a hero. One   favours realism, the other idealism. The proponents of the former take as hero   an actual person, by which I mean they build a fictitious hero around the   personality of an ordinary man from contemporary society. The Tamenaga school of    ninj&#333;bon writers used this method. The idealists' method, on the other   hand, is to create a fictitious character based on the way man's nature ought to   be. The essential difference between the two streams is that the realists take   as their material ordinary men, the idealists men as they should be.      Within the idealist school itself there is a further   subdivision into the \"heredity\" (deductive) method and the \"environment\"   (inductive) method. The deductive method creates the characteristics of the hero   as they appear in the book by dissecting and analyzing in minute detail an ideal   nature which has already been decided upon. Bakin often used this method for his   heroes, most notably the eight dog-knights of Hakkenden and Sanketsu in    Shima Meguri no Ki . The eight dog-knights are imaginary characters in   whom the metaphysical characteristics of benevolence, justice, courtesy, wisdom,   sincerity, loyalty, filial piety, and obedience are separated out and applied to   the physical world. In other words, the eight abstract rules of conduct are   embodied in tangible human form. Likewise the three heroes of Shima Meguri no   Ki --Yoshihide personifies courage, Minamoto Kanja Yoshikuni benevolence, and   Mitsunaka wisdom. While the deductive method is very interesting, if the author   is not sufficiently selective he will sometimes create bizarre apparitions which   seem like human beings but are not. The eight heroes of Hakkenden are   rare, strange beings who resemble the saints and sages themselves perhaps   because Bakin based them on philosophers' theories. While the deductive method   should not be dismissed out of hand on this account, it would be highly improper   to use it to recreate known historical personages (in historical novels). Asaina   Yoshihide, 9 for   example, is an actual historical figure, not a fictitious character. One cannot   therefore justify manufacturing his actions and words in such a way as   arbitrarily to embody courage in his person. As I have already said in an   earlier chapter, the aims of the historical novel are to fill in the facts   omitted from histories and give the reader the subtle impression that he is in   close contact with historical figures. When the Asaina Yoshihide of the story is   made to personify courage, he is no longer the Asaina Yoshihide of history. The   name is the same, but the person is different. Leaving aside for the moment the   effectiveness of the device and looking at it from a theoretical point of view,   it is inexcusable for an author to use the deductive method to wilfully recreate   a historical figure in accordance with his own arbitrary opinions. Indeed, to do   so is to forget the first principle of the historical novel. Keikoku   Bidan , recently translated by Yano Fumio, 10   has been criticized by a certain scholar because its three heroes symbolize   wisdom, moral integrity, and emotion. If this is so, it seems somewhat less than   satisfactory--Epaminondas 11   and Pelopidas 12   are actual historical figures, not creations of their author.    An author using the inductive method, on the other hand, creates his   characters by using his own imagination to select and judiciously compound a   collection of various characteristics found in living men. As he relies for the   most part on experience and observation to help him formulate those   characteristics which will make up elements of people's personalities, he does   not, like those who apply the deductive method, become so carried away with   empty theorizing that his characters bear no resemblance whatsoever to real   human beings. Most eighteenth century novelists, including Britain's Scott, used   the inductive method; Lytton and others also seem devoted to it.    The realist's approach, unlike the two methods just   mentioned, involves taking real people as heroes--Tanjir&#333; in Umegoyomi , 13   for example, and Prince Genji in Genji Monogatari . There must have been   many people like Tanjir&#333; in Shunsui's day, and many men of rank like Genji in   Lady Shikibu's. For that reason, indeed, inferior scholars of the classics have   called Genji Monogatari a didactic work, and spread it about that each of   its male and female characters represents a contemporary figure. They are very   much mistaken--they have failed to realize that Lady Shikibu was using the   realistic approach to characterization.    One may sum up the two techniques by saying that whereas it is easy to enter   the gate of the realist school but not so simple to ascend to its chambers, it   is difficult to gain entrance to the idealist school, but, once in, it is easy   to get into its chambers. The former concentrates on describing human nature as   it is, so that the author is under no compulsion to devise his own standards of   perfect beauty and goodness. With the latter, on the other hand, it is the   author himself who contrives the criteria for beauty and ugliness, and dreams up   his own good and bad characters. The foremost difficulty he faces, however, is   that if he does not set his standards high enough, the plot will often be the   worse for it, and if he sets them too high, his characters will not be   convincing. If his standards are just right, the rest will follow easily from   his own ideas. Those who employ the realist method, on the other hand, face   their worst difficulties after the gate has been breached. The realist school   may be compared to a painter painting a human form, the idealist to one painting   an angel. Many can paint the human form, but few manage it with divine skill.   Few can paint an angel, but many of those who can are able to move people with   their portrait. It all goes back to the basic difference between truth and   falsehood!         As I have already discussed in part in Chapter Three of Part   One, the aspect of characterization which requires most care on the part of an   author is that his own personality traits should not be incorporated into his   characters, to emerge in their behaviour. If he attempts to create fictitious   characters based on his own nature, he will of course end up with nothing more   than a clutch of identical types, which in the end will give a false ring to the   story. The reader will grow bored, and lose his sense of participation, of   disporting himself in a dream world. Many inexperienced writers are prone to   this fault, which renders Shichi Henjin and Wag&#333;jin 14 ,   despite their interesting plots, totally unable to compare with    Hizakurige in quality. All the libertines in Shichi Henjin , with   the single exception of Wajir&#333;, are so similar in nature that they seem like the   same person. Birds of a feather flock together, true, but it is hard to believe   there could be people whose actions and words are as similar as that. If it were   not for the fact that they have individual names, Shichi Henjin 15   would be no more than a nominal title for a book with an apparent population of   only two or three. Most of the words and actions portrayed bear the same stamp   rather than seeming to belong to seven individuals, because the whole thing   resembles a soliloquy by the author. The toy which little girls play with, the   \"actor with one hundred faces,\" exemplifies the principle. In a bushy-haired   wig, it looks like Ishikawa Goemon, 16 in   a priest's wig like Yokokawa Kakunori, 17 in   a tonbogami 18   like Yojir&#333; the monkey trainer, 19   and in a shimada topknot like Hanako the temple dancer. 20   The facades are different, but it is always the same person underneath. Careful   scrutiny of the toy reveals that under all its disguises is a cheap trinket,   which makes it only something to entertain a little girl's undemanding eyes. Its   novelty is certainly not of an order to impress adults and scholars.    Writing is an extremely difficult task. In both essays and descriptive   compositions, a great deal of thought must be given to the ordering of structure   and design, neither of which can be carelessly treated. Writing a novel is most   difficult of all. Unlike other ordinary forms of writing, the novel requires   more than a frank description of the author's own thoughts and feelings. Its   duty is to hide those as well as it can so that they do not show, to portray   vividly and with animation human nature as it exists in other people in its   infinite variety. Ordinary writers write like experienced public speakers. For   them, to inspire their readers by conveying their own wholehearted enthusiasms   through their writing is both to meet their obligations and also to turn in a   fine performance. Were a novelist to seem like an orator, however, he would be   doing a very bad job, even worse if he had anything of the puppeteer about him.   He should write in the manner of a Creator amusing himself with all the human   beings in creation. If this is beyond him, then he will most nearly approach   mastery by acting like a clever magician who makes insensate objects run or leap   about from some distance away. To put it briefly, allowing the reader to become   aware of the relationship between the novel's author and its characters is the   height of incompetence. Anyone attempting to write a novel must take into   account this crucial point.    Chapter Six    Narrative    I use the term \"narrative\" here to embrace all the non-dialogue parts of the   novel, whether accounts of the background to characters and events or   descriptions of temperaments and scenery.    The narration of past events sometimes demands brevity, sometimes detail.   While he cannot predetermine his reader's reaction, an author should, of course,   guard as much as practicable against boring him with an over-abundance of   detail. Historical novels, however, must necessarily begin by giving the reader   some idea of the quality of human nature and events at the time in question. It   would be wrong to insist that such particulars be arbitrarily curtailed merely   to avoid the charge of over-complexity. The long historical account at the   beginning of Hakkenden and the two or three chapters of factual   information usually found in Scott's historical novels are no doubt prompted by   this necessity. To begin with an unadorned, lengthy recitation of facts, though,   would probably weary the reader--some other acceptable device must be found to   sketch in the background for him. Bakin hit on an excellent idea in    Bish&#333;nenroku when he had a large snake speak of contemporary events,   human nature, and social conditions rather than setting them down in narrative   form. Leaving aside for a moment the quality of the book as a whole and looking   at it in the light of the work Bakin put into it, one can indeed see in    Bish&#333;nenroku a novel device for making sport of the eccentricities of the   times. Bakin's so-called technique of abbreviation may also be applied to   narration. Used properly, its effectiveness is undeniable. To avoid redundancy I   shall not go into the details here. Think about it yourselves!    Description needs as much detail as possible. Authors of Japanese novels in   the past have been content to rely on miniature illustrations to make up any   descriptive deficiencies in their text, often not bothering with verbal   depictions of people and scenery at all, but in this they have made a grave   mistake. The charm of the novel is not confined to bringing only its characters   to life. Its object is to bring the whole of creation into play on paper. One of   its abilities is to make its thunder rumble, its raging seas mount up to the   skies, its nightingales warble, and its plum blossoms perfume the air. To   describe only the attitudes of characters, to the exclusion of inanimate   objects, is like drawing an ascending dragon without clouds.    There are two ways of describing a person's character. I shall call them the   negative method and the positive method. The former, used by most Japanese   novelists, indirectly makes a character's nature known through his speech and   conduct rather than by stating it frankly. The latter, favoured by Western   novelists, acquaints the reader from the beginning with a character's   disposition by describing it openly. (See the section describing Princess Nina   in Part 7 of Rienzi .) The positive method is probably more difficult to   use than the negative--one needs a knowledge of the main points of psychology and   a grasp of the principles of physiognomy and phrenology to succeed. One should   not, however, make any hasty assertions about the relative merits of the two. An   author should use whichever seems appropriate to the occasion. If the positive   method is not skilfully used, subtle nuances will be lost, while mishandling of   the negative method hinders discussion of the central issues of human nature.   Authors may ponder their relative merits by examining the ancient and modern   historical romances of both East and West.    I have not yet exhausted my topic, but I am being hurried by the bookstores,   and I do not think it possible to complete my discussion, which could go on   forever, within a set time limit. I shall therefore lay my pen down here for the   time being, and fill in the gaps in a later supplement. It would please me   greatly if the reader, instead of criticizing my uncompleted arguments and   disorganized writing, would communicate to me his opinions, regardless of   whether or not they agree with my own.
