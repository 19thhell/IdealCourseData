Previously, the programs and faculty that now comprise this department were scattered throughout the school. With the support of the school's faculty and administration, we are now one unit better able to achieve our dual purpose of providing disciplinary and research course work for students in other parts of the school, while also preparing students within our own departments for positions leading to research and teaching in colleges and universities, in government, and in other service organizations both nationally and internationally.
