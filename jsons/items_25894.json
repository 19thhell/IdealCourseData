Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!

Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!

NYU has specialized Explorations communities in both the FYRE (First Year Residential Experience) and upper-class halls.   The theme in each community is explored through programs and activities which are planned by the Resident Assistant (RA), a Faculty Affiliate, and the residents on the floor.   Institutions across the country are recognizing the importance of creating and maintaining collaborative learning communities that cross traditional campus boundaries between the formal classroom and the residential setting. Research repeatedly supports that the degree to which a student persists and succeeds in a university setting is directly related to the establishment of a community and culture of learning across the campus.   NYU students indicate the Explorations program helps them connect with the University and each other quickly and meaningfully. As compared to other on campus students, Explorations participants reported that they were more likely to:     Have higher satisfaction with the programming offered in the residence halls   Have an easier time integrating to college   Connect quickly with faculty and staff on campus     Have an easier time meeting other students   Be satisfied with the room assignments process   Feel that living on campus enhanced their academic performance            How do I apply for an Explorations community?     Returning and Incoming students may access the Explorations application through the NYU Housing (re) application (available through NYUHome: Housing Forms).   After submitting information, there are a few additional questions you will be asked regarding your interest in particular Explorations themes.

First Year Explorations Communities 2015-2016                               3N Theatre Arts Company // Third North     New York City is arguably the greatest theatre city in the world, so let\u2019s make a contribution! Join this community, and be a theatre maker. 3NTAC community members will see theatre productions together, learn about the process of making theatre, and even get the opportunity to produce performances in the residence hall! Activities will include public play readings, field trips to see plays and musicals, a 24-hour original play festival, meetings with working artists, and original 3NTAC productions. This community is open to all students regardless of school or major, so join us and become part of the New York theatre scene!   Aperture: NYC Through the Lens // Third North   As part of the Aperture community, you will be encouraged to explore the many ways in which your identity and your New York story can be expressed through photography. From black and white film to digital images, you and your peers will investigate exhibits, galleries, subways and city streets while creating a portfolio depicting your first year at NYU. Through a supportive community of twenty fellow photo-buffs, you will have the opportunity to share techniques, learn more about your camera, and get out into the city. You will have access to university resources like Photoshop, through which you can further experiment and learn about various photography editing techniques. Capture your vision of the city by going on field trips to iconic sites like the Brooklyn Bridge and Times Square. Aperture residents are encouraged to exhibit their photographs for one month in the Third North atrium. This floor is a phenomenal opportunity for advanced photographers and for beginners alike, whether you are handy with a SLR camera or just your camera-phone. No experience with photography is necessary but a sincere interest is encouraged.     Artists in Development // Founders Hall   Artists In Development is about personal growth, extending social and business networks and developing technique in the art world of New York City. It is a community in which serious like-minded persons interested in any art form (dance, film, photography, drama, etc.) get together and collaborate, share information and helpful tips about the \u201cbiz\u201d, participate in fun workshops around the city, and produce a showcase at the end of the semester.   Big Apple, Big Screen // Brittany Hall     With filmmakers like Cassavetes and NYU alumni Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee working its streets, New York City has developed a rich history in cinema, and it remains a capital of the big screen. Big Apple, Big Screen will feature visits to neighborhood cinemas all over Manhattan, from the Magic Johnson on 125th to the Screening Room in Tribeca, in the two-fold effort to keep current with cinema and current with New York City. Discussions about cinema in general films in particular will take place over dinners or double espressos. In addition, students will get the unique opportunity to plan and curate a \u201cFilmathon\u201d for the NYU community during the Spring semester.   Contemporary Currents // Rubin Hall   Calling all first-year students who care about changing the status quo! The Contemporary Currents floor will be your one-way ticket to learning all about and engaging in social-justice-related issues around the world. Not only will you get the chance to hone your civic leadership skills by partaking in forums, workshops, lectures, and panels in NYC, but you will also receive the support you need to jump-start your very own service project idea. Essentially, what this floor is about can be summed up in two words: education and intervention. In other words, educate yourself, and then get involved!     Cool Science // Weinstein   Science provides a way to understand ourselves and the world in which we live. It allows us to peer at the most distance galaxies, and to study molecular changes within our cells. It provides powerful tools to cure disease and harvest new sources of energy. Yet it also raises ethical questions about the appropriate use of the new knowledge we gain. This Explorations floor is offered for all students who are interested in science. We welcome science majors, pre-medical students, and anyone who is curious about life and the cosmos. We will visit important scientific institutions in New York, including the American Museum of Natural History and the New York Academy of Sciences. We will learn about cutting-edge science research through lectures by NYU faculty. We will examine how science and scientists are represented in movies, plays, TV, and literature. As a service to our local community, we will also partner with schools to offer math and science tutoring.     Culture, Arts and The City // Third North &amp; Othmer     In this explorations community, students will learn to consider the cultures of New York City through a variety of artistic media and representations. By exploring the cultures of the city through its manifold artistic expressions (e.g., film, theater, museum exhibits and the culinary arts), residents will simultaneously deepen their knowledge of its various communities and learn to think about urban experience as a socially and culturally embedded phenomenon. Whether viewing a classic film about racial tensions in a multi-ethnic neighborhood in Brooklyn or learning about the history of immigrant communities through food and the culinary arts, residents will be encouraged to think about cities as sites of local and global exchange and possibility. Special emphasis will be placed on how urban experience and artistic representation can prompt us to become more critical and informed citizens of New York\u2014and the world.   Enterprising the Artist // Rubin Hall   Enterprising the Artist is a community for those interested in both the performance and production side of the arts. This community is for anyone interested in the arts (dance, film, photography, drama, music, poetry, spoken-word, creative writing, etc.). Students will come together to both attend performances and have opportunities to explore the behind the scenes production and business of the industry.     F.A.M.E. (Featuring All Musical Endeavors) // Brittany Hall     Ever wonder what the Eagles meant by in a \u201cNew York Minute\u201d or why the Beastie Boys crooned \u201cNo Sleep \u2018till Brooklyn?\u201d From rock to classical, New York City is the center for emerging musical talent. Whether you\u2019re a cool cat, rock idol, or classicist, come and explore the evolution of musical dynamics, styles, and appreciation from concert halls to recording studios and historical venues. What musical craze will you discover? Emphasis will be placed not only on external sources of musical influence, but also on student expression and musical talent. All genres of music will be explored from Punk to Classical, Hip Hop to Reggae, and Rock to Jazz.

Fashion in New York City // Rubin Hall   The excitement of New York City is palpable, and one thing that thrives in this fast pace environment is the fashion world. There are a plethora of opportunities that only NYC can offer to a budding fashionista/fashionisto who is interested in this industry. The wide array of New York's fashion activities -- from museum and gallery exhibitions, to designer discussions, to vintage shopping -- can create a stable foundation of knowledge that will be forever helpful regardless of one's final destination. Fashion is a cumulative organism, constantly referencing its past history, as well as its cultural history (ranging from music, to cinema, to political climate), and adapting to its present time. The Fashion In New York City explorations floor will seek out opportunities to learn, explore, and experience the wonderful world of Fashion that exists and has existed in the city. We will discuss various moments in time that have had a major impact in fashion and how the industry has changed from it.

The Meaning of Food // Brittany Hall   Based on the PBS Documentary Series of the same name, The Meaning of Food is an exploration of culture through food. What we consume, how we acquire it, who prepares it, who\u2019s at the table, and who eats first is a form of communication that is rich with meaning. This explorations floor will introduce students to diverse cultures utilizing food and restaurants throughout New York City. Food will be explored through three lenses: food and life; food and family; and food and culture. Beyond merely nourishing the body, what we eat and with whom we eat can inspire and strengthen the bonds between individuals, communities and even countries. Residents will be able to discover attitudes, practices and rituals surrounding food. In addition to exploring restaurants in NYC, residents will watch documentary films, read common literature and participate in community service opportunities that will allow residents to give to those who lack their own food resources.

NYU CORPS (Community Outreach Performing Service) // Founders Hall   What does it mean to be the change you want to see? What does it look like to truly give? And, what does it take to make a resolve an epidemic? NYU Community Outreach Performing Service (CORPS) aims to answer these questions with a focus on service immersion and humanitarian studies. Students within this community will actively discuss, partake, program, and converse on humanitarian issues, such as poverty, oppression, and international politics, as they affect New York City. Students will have the opportunity, through numerous different options, to actively serve within the community. Lastly, though not a requirement, students will have the opportunity to partake in a domestic or international service immersion trip with fellow community members during Spring Break of the Spring semester. The exact site is to be determined among the community during the Fall semester.   NYU Show // Hayden Hall     Are you friends with that all-American appliance: the television?

The wide array of New York sports \u2013 from baseball to soccer to roller derby \u2013 has a rich and unique history, deeply interwoven in New York culture.

In addition, sponsored activities will include events such as a speaker series with alumni entrepreneurs and other members of our entrepreneurship community, training workshops focused on relevant skills, and field trips to connect with the broader startup community in NYC.

Food for Thought // Carlyle Court     For students away from home, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be both a challenge and an exciting opportunity. New York City offers a vast range of choices for exploring the subject of health and nutrition from markets, restaurants and cooking schools catering to macrobiotic, organic, vegan, and raw foodist lifestyles to clubs and communities committed to activities such as meditation, yoga, running, hiking, and kayaking on the Hudson, to name only a few. In addition to pursuing the more practical aspects of healthy living, our community will approach the subject of health as an intellectual field of research as well, interrogating some of its broader historical, political, and cultural implications, by hosting a series of lectures, screening documentary films as well as other activities. We may also explore developing a relationship between a local farmer and our residence hall community through a program called &quot;community supported agriculture,&quot; which brings local, seasonal, and organic produce into our community. Through participation in this community, students will discover the many personal and social benefits that come from maintaining a healthy lifestyle both in mind and body.   Geek NYC // Coral Tower     Looking for a community that celebrates your inner geek? Geek NYC is a floor that celebrates people with all sorts of &quot;nerdy&quot; interests, particularly those in science fiction and fantasy. We will discover this often-underrated side of New York City, and explore all it has to offer.

NYC in the 60s // Greenwich Hall   The 1960's was a groundbreaking era for many subcultures and movements in America. As the largest city in the country, New York acted as a center for change during this time. The city was host to such people and events as Andy Warhol, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, The Stonewall Inn Riots, demonstrations against the Vietnam War, the Great Blackout, and the founding of the Mets baseball team.

Science and Technology in the 21st Century // Palladium Hall   We are all witnessing tremendous advancements in the sciences--advancements that create societal benefits, conflicts, and contradictions. The genomes of many organisms have been sequenced, allowing us to decipher information encoded in their DNA in an unprecedented way. Will this lead to better medical treatments, or will it provide the means to create and organize new forms of bioterrorist weaponry? The World Wide Web has linked the continents, escalating communication and globalization. Will this catalyze societal homogenization in a desirable or undesirable way? Here at the onset of this centenary, the Science and Technology in the 21st Century community will explore current scientific and technological explorations, emphasizing the future prospects for change that discoveries in these areas will elicit.

Although Serve the City will be focused on building a tight-knit floor community, we will also occasionally reach out to other hall residents by inviting them to serve with us. During the fall semester, community members will discuss participating in either a domestic or international service trip over spring break.   Spirituality in NYC // Gramercy Green     Break out of your comfort zone. Engage with people of different faiths and backgrounds. Working with Faculty Affiliates Rabbi Yehuda Sarna and Imam Khalid Latif, you will meet leaders on the cutting edge of the spiritual landscape of NYC, visit global institutions such as the United Nations, and get trained in cross-faith bridge-building competencies. Open to everyone \u2013 you do not have to be an active member of any religion to be a part of this Explorations community.   Take-Offs and Landings // Gramercy Green     As NYU moves closer toward becoming a global network of campuses, we need to provide opportunities for students to connect with other students who are about to go abroad and those for those students who have recently returned. This floor would be a place for students to connect with the global network in both social and educational ways. Students will be able to participate in programming that is directly related to both study abroad sites and the very act of travel and studying abroad. For example, members might attend a performance of Argentine Tango Off-Broadway followed by a meal of empanadas prepared by a student who has recently returned from Buenos Aires. The after-performance discussion might take place while enjoying the empanadas and hearing a lecture/ slide show from a returning student. Other activities might include connecting with the travel bookshop Idlewild Books or bringing in travel experts to discuss things like staying connected while abroad or how to set up a Flickr account to store and organize all of your photos. I would be interested in bringing in experts from the health center to talk about specific issues related to health and safety while studying abroad.

This community will be comprised of transfer students in their first, second, and third years at NYU, offering opportunities to learn from each others' experiences and explore new facets of NYC together.

Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!

NYU has specialized Explorations communities in both the FYRE (First Year Residential Experience) and upper-class halls.   The theme in each community is explored through programs and activities which are planned by the Resident Assistant (RA), a Faculty Affiliate, and the residents on the floor.   Institutions across the country are recognizing the importance of creating and maintaining collaborative learning communities that cross traditional campus boundaries between the formal classroom and the residential setting. Research repeatedly supports that the degree to which a student persists and succeeds in a university setting is directly related to the establishment of a community and culture of learning across the campus.   NYU students indicate the Explorations program helps them connect with the University and each other quickly and meaningfully. As compared to other on campus students, Explorations participants reported that they were more likely to:     Have higher satisfaction with the programming offered in the residence halls   Have an easier time integrating to college   Connect quickly with faculty and staff on campus     Have an easier time meeting other students   Be satisfied with the room assignments process   Feel that living on campus enhanced their academic performance            How do I apply for an Explorations community?     Returning and Incoming students may access the Explorations application through the NYU Housing (re) application (available through NYUHome: Housing Forms).   After submitting information, there are a few additional questions you will be asked regarding your interest in particular Explorations themes.

Cool Science // Weinstein   Science provides a way to understand ourselves and the world in which we live.

The wide array of New York's fashion activities -- from museum and gallery exhibitions, to designer discussions, to vintage shopping -- can create a stable foundation of knowledge that will be forever helpful regardless of one's final destination. Fashion is a cumulative organism, constantly referencing its past history, as well as its cultural history (ranging from music, to cinema, to political climate), and adapting to its present time. The Fashion In New York City explorations floor will seek out opportunities to learn, explore, and experience the wonderful world of Fashion that exists and has existed in the city.

NYC in the 60s // Greenwich Hall   The 1960's was a groundbreaking era for many subcultures and movements in America. As the largest city in the country, New York acted as a center for change during this time. The city was host to such people and events as Andy Warhol, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, The Stonewall Inn Riots, demonstrations against the Vietnam War, the Great Blackout, and the founding of the Mets baseball team. The influences of the '60s still affect the city today, and traces of this decade can be found especially around NYU. Join this community for the opportunity to explore and learn more about this influential time in our dynamic city.     NYC Spotlight // Palladium Hall   Do you find yourself captivated by the stunning performances only found in the big apple? Join this floor to unravel the rich culture of New York's entertainment scene. From local music festivals to Broadway theatre spectacles, join us in delving into the city's artistic cornucopia. Come enjoy a broad range of music, film, and theatre; three of the main aspects that make NYC thrive. These are some of the main reasons that people come to the city - both to enjoy them and produce them. Take advantage of what the heart of the city has to offer. Perhaps you will see a concert at Lincoln Center, talk with an esteemed film director, or catch a Broadway show on the weekend. The possibilities are endless!   The Rainbow Roster: An LGBTQ and Ally Community // Lafayette Hall     The Rainbow Roster is designed for residents committed to community service and cultural development within the LGBTQ and Ally community. All are welcome, so long as they share a passion for the civil rights of all individuals, particularly historically under-represented populations. As a member of the Rainbow Roster, residents will learn about the rich lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer history that is unique to New York City. We will go on cultural outings around the boroughs, including Gay Men's Chorus concerts, musicals and plays, and film events. We will also go out into the community and work on service projects with organizations such as The Trevor Project, the Ali Forney Center, and the LGBT Community Center. The Rainbow Roster is a safe, accepting, and exciting community where residents can become more self-aware, community-conscious, and open-minded.   Science and Technology in the 21st Century // Palladium Hall   We are all witnessing tremendous advancements in the sciences--advancements that create societal benefits, conflicts, and contradictions. The genomes of many organisms have been sequenced, allowing us to decipher information encoded in their DNA in an unprecedented way. Will this lead to better medical treatments, or will it provide the means to create and organize new forms of bioterrorist weaponry? The World Wide Web has linked the continents, escalating communication and globalization. Will this catalyze societal homogenization in a desirable or undesirable way? Here at the onset of this centenary, the Science and Technology in the 21st Century community will explore current scientific and technological explorations, emphasizing the future prospects for change that discoveries in these areas will elicit. You will approach science and technologies not only from the vantage points of biology, chemistry, physics, math and computer, but also study their interface with law, business, economics, and the arts. And, New York City will be your laboratory!   Senior House // West 13th Street   The 13th Street Residence Hall has been selected as the location for Senior House, a smaller hall designed to provide more opportunity to know your neighbors and build better relationships. At the Senior House, you will experience hallmarks such as trips to the surrounding boroughs, personalized career services from the Wasserman Center, resources for thesis work such as an onsite copy machine, unique links to the Senior Class Council, and the Senior Year themed programming. We expect that students will not only build community within the Senior House, but also be able to have a capstone experience to make the Senior Year their best year yet at NYU!   Serve the City // Coral Tower   Serve the City is a community designed for upperclassmen who are passionate about community service and interested in humanitarian issues. We will participate in service projects throughout New York City's five boroughs as well as host documentary screenings and discussions about various service related topics. If interested, residents on this floor will have the opportunity to suggest and program their own service projects. Although Serve the City will be focused on building a tight-knit floor community, we will also occasionally reach out to other hall residents by inviting them to serve with us. During the fall semester, community members will discuss participating in either a domestic or international service trip over spring break.   Spirituality in NYC // Gramercy Green     Break out of your comfort zone. Engage with people of different faiths and backgrounds. Working with Faculty Affiliates Rabbi Yehuda Sarna and Imam Khalid Latif, you will meet leaders on the cutting edge of the spiritual landscape of NYC, visit global institutions such as the United Nations, and get trained in cross-faith bridge-building competencies. Open to everyone \u2013 you do not have to be an active member of any religion to be a part of this Explorations community.   Take-Offs and Landings // Gramercy Green     As NYU moves closer toward becoming a global network of campuses, we need to provide opportunities for students to connect with other students who are about to go abroad and those for those students who have recently returned. This floor would be a place for students to connect with the global network in both social and educational ways. Students will be able to participate in programming that is directly related to both study abroad sites and the very act of travel and studying abroad. For example, members might attend a performance of Argentine Tango Off-Broadway followed by a meal of empanadas prepared by a student who has recently returned from Buenos Aires. The after-performance discussion might take place while enjoying the empanadas and hearing a lecture/ slide show from a returning student. Other activities might include connecting with the travel bookshop Idlewild Books or bringing in travel experts to discuss things like staying connected while abroad or how to set up a Flickr account to store and organize all of your photos. I would be interested in bringing in experts from the health center to talk about specific issues related to health and safety while studying abroad.   Transfer Floor // Lafayette Hall     Join the inaugural year for the Transfer Explorations Community at NYU. This community will be comprised of transfer students in their first, second, and third years at NYU, offering opportunities to learn from each others' experiences and explore new facets of NYC together. Academic-related offerings will include optional seminars from campus partners, the opportunity for extra academic advising, and dedicated faculty leadership. The Transfer Explorations Community is the ideal location to base your second or third year in the NYU community.

PAC I is offered in the fall semester and PAC II is offered in the spring semester. The courses should be taken in sequence, as PAC I is a prerequisite for PAC II.    Intensive Introduction to Graduate Study in Computer Science I, CSCI-GA 1133 (PAC I) is an accelerated introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer science for students who lack a formal background in the field. Topics include algorithm design and program development; data types; control structures; subroutines and parameter passing; recursion; data structures; searching and sorting; dynamic storage allocation; abstract data types, such as stacks, queues, lists, and tree structures; and an introduction to the principles of object-oriented programming. The primary programming language used in the course will be Java. Students should expect an average of 12-16 hours of programming and related course work per week.    Intensive Introduction to Graduate Study in Computer Science II, CSCI-GA 1144 (PAC II) builds directly on the foundation developed in PAC I, covering the essentials of computer organization through the study of assembly language programming and C, as well as introducing the students to the analysis of algorithms. Topics include:    1. Assembly language programming for the Intel chip family, emphasizing computer organization, the Intel x86 instruction set, the logic of machine addressing, registers and the system stack.    2. Programming in the C language, a general-purpose programming language which also has low-level features for systems programming.    3. An introduction to algorithms, including searching, sorting, graph algorithms and asymptotic complexity.    Examples and assignments reinforce and refine those first seen in PAC I and often connect directly to topics in the core computer science graduate courses, such as Programming Languages, Fundamental Algorithms, and Operating Systems.    Please note that the credits for PAC I and PAC II cannot be applied to a master&rsquo;s of science in computer science (MSCS) or a master&rsquo;s of science in information systems (MSIS).    Admissions for the Program:    There are three ways to be eligible to take the PAC Program.    1. Applying to a Computer Science Department Master&rsquo;s Program    Applicants whose previous training does not qualify them for admission to the MS programs , but who otherwise show aptitude for graduate study in computer science may be admitted on a conditional basis, with the requirement of successful completion of the PAC Program. In this instance, the admissions committee makes a determination that an application is acceptable, but the technical experience of the prospective student is inadequate to meet the demands of graduate level course work in the Computer Science Department. If the student successfully completes the PAC Program, then the student can continue on in the master&rsquo;s program. If the student does not successfully complete the PAC Program, the student cannot continue on in the degree program. To apply, go to the GSAS Application Resource Center.    2. Applying as a Non-Degree student    One can apply by direct application as a non-degree applicant. If accepted, non-degree students may enroll for a maximum of 12 credits over not more than three consecutive semesters. The applicant must hold a bachelor's degree or equivalent at the time of application. If accepted and the student wishes to take more than 12 credits of coursework, the student would need to apply to a degree program and be accepted. Please note that acceptance as a non-degree student does not guarantee acceptance into a degree program. To apply, go to the GSAS Application Resource Center.    3. Current NYU students    The PAC Program is open to current NYU students. If an NYU student is interested in taking the courses, the student should first discuss the option with his or her academic advisor. It is important to ask the advisor whether the credits can be applied to a student&rsquo;s degree program. While the credits cannot be applied towards an MSCS or MSIS degree, some other programs do count them. After speaking with the advisor, the student should speak to the instructor of the course to ensure that it is a good fit for the student.    If a student decides to enroll in the course, he or she should e-mail Jennifer Conlan Darlington at conlan@cs.nyu.edu or Katie Hughes at hughes@cs.nyu.edu to request registration in the course. The student&rsquo;s name, NYU ID number, and the course name and course number should be included in the e-mail. The e-mail should be sent from an NYU e-mail account. Once registered, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the student.    Special Note for International Students    International students on an F1 visa need to maintain full-time equivalency to stay in status with their visa requirements. Such students will need to register for at least 9 credits in the fall and spring semester, while taking the PAC courses. As such, in order to qualify for full-time status, they will be required, under advisement by the Director of Graduate Studies, to register for undergraduate computer science classes of level 200 or greater, graduate mathematics courses, and other selectively chosen courses. The PAC and undergraduate courses would not be counted towards the master's degree requirements.    Note that the visa document (certificate of eligibility, form I-20 or DS-2019) will state that the student is in the Preparatory Course Program for the first year. Once the student has passed the program, the student will be issued a certificate of eligibility from OISS for the master's program.
