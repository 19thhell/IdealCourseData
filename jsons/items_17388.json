We teach you how to design new organizational structures, how to resolve conflicts, and how to supervise and mentor talented employees. We also help you with outsourcing issues, as well as decisions about which among the continually evolving technologies out there today can best nurture an organization&rsquo;s growth.   At the School of Engineering, you&rsquo;ll learn such skills because our program is flexible. You choose the concentration that interests you most before enrolling in seminar-style classes. Held in the evenings, these classes allow our students to tend to their busy lives and still earn a degree. Better yet, the seminar format allows students to work closely with their classmates and to receive individual attention from faculty. Depending on your course load, you can earn your MS in 1 to 2 years.   Admission Requirements   Criteria for admission include a bachelor&rsquo;s degree with at least a B average from an accredited college or university and demonstrated evidence of motivation, maturity, and the ability to benefit from and contribute to professional graduate studies in Organizational Behavior, Systems, and Analytics. Applicants who do not meet all the criteria may be admitted as nondegree students with the subsequent opportunity to become a degree candidate. Satisfactory scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or an acceptable equivalent test, such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), may be used as additional support for admission to degree studies.   Students who have not completed an undergraduate course in statistics must enroll in MG 5050 Probability and Managerial Statistics or its equivalent. Students without an adequate background in computers may be required to enroll in 1 or more of the preparatory courses offered by the Department of Computer and Information Sciences. These courses are in addition to the degree requirements.      This program is also offered online .                                           Academic Director        Harold G.
