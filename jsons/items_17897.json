General:    The following policies and procedures are those by which alleged violations of University student conduct policies will be reviewed and resolved through the University Student Conduct Process. Please note that these procedures do not apply in matters of complaints of alleged sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, relationship violence, and/or sexual harassment). Such complaints are addressed through the process for  Reporting, Investigating, and Resolving Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Complaints Against Students .       A. The Complaint:  Any member of the faculty, administration, or staff or any student may file a complaint against any student for a student offense with the Dean of the school in which the student complained of is enrolled or with the Vice President for Student Affairs. Although a complaint may be filed at any time, it is strongly preferred that the complaint be submitted as soon as possible after the reporter/complainant became aware of the matter. A complaint should include a description of the incident giving rise to the complaint, the identity of the accused student(s), and the names of others who may have been present, observed the incident, or who otherwise have information related to the matter. Notice of the filing of a formal complaint shall be mailed to the student within 48 hours.   NOTE:  1. A report submitted to the Department of Public Safety or another University office does  not constitute a student conduct complaint which automatically initiates a student conduct action.  2. A report filed by a staff member in Residential Life and Housing Services is considered to be a complaint for cases reviewed through the Residential Life student conduct process.  3. An academic school may have different procedures for filing a complaint. Readers are urged to contact the school for specific information.     B. Consideration of Interim Suspension:   As provided in by-law 62, the President or the Dean of a school, or their respective designees may determine to suspend the student who is accused of having violated University policy pending consideration of his/her case through the disciplinary process. In matters of Student Affairs jurisdiction, the President\u2019s designee shall be the Vice President for Student Affairs. A student should not be summarily suspended either completely or for certain purposes, except for reasons relating to his/her physical or emotional safety and well-being, the safety and well-being of students, faculty, or staff, or University property, the maintenance of public order, or the effective continuation of the education process. When this occurs, the student shall be afforded the opportunity to expedite disciplinary proceedings so as to enable the determination of the appropriate resolution at the earliest possible time. Any period of interim suspension shall be deducted from any ultimate sanction involving suspension. A student who has been subject to interim suspension and who is found \u201cnot responsible\u201d shall be allowed full opportunity to make up whatever work was missed due to the suspension.     C. Preliminary Investigation:  A staff member in the Office of Community Standards will commence the process of reviewing the complaint, report and other materials associated with the matter by contacting the Complainant or the person filing the report. The Director will also notify the student(s) named in the complaint or report to inform the student(s) of the filing of the complaint/report and request to meet with those individuals. During the respective meetings/discussions, the students (Complainant and Accused) shall be informed of their rights and responsibilities within the student conduct process, be apprised of the University\u2019s related procedures, and asked to discuss the incident giving rise to the report/complaint. The students may also be asked to submit (by a designated date) a written statement about the incident and to provide the name and contact information of any witnesses/others who might be able to offer information regarding the matter.     D. Disposition:  Based upon the preliminary investigation, the Office of Community Standards, at its sole discretion, will make the determination as to the appropriate disposition of the matter through one of the following courses of action:     1. Dismissal: The report/complaint will be dismissed if it appears not to have merit or even if the facts alleged in the complaint are true there would be no violation of a University policy.     2. Referral: The matter will be referred to another University office or process if that office or process is thought to be the more appropriate venue through which to address the matter.     3. Non-Judicial Intervention: At the discretion of the Office of Community Standards, the matter may be resolved through a non-judicial intervention (e.g. mediation, educational interventions, administrative actions) if it is deemed to be of a minor nature that is appropriately addressed in such a manner.     4. Review Under Residence Life Student Conduct Process: http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/get-to-know-yourhome/judicial-information.html     a. If the matter involves only alleged violations of Residence Hall policies, the matter will be adjudicated through the appropriate administrator on the Department of Residence Life and Housing Services, acting under the guidance/supervision of the Office of Community Standards using the Residence Life disciplinary policies and procedures. A summary of this process is as follows:     \u2022 The administrator in the Office of Residence Life and Housing Services reviews the report and investigates the matter to determine if there is any alleged violation of residence hall policy.  \u2022 The administrator in the Office of Residence Life and Housing Services will meet with the student who is alleged to have violated the residence hall policies and with others who have knowledge of the matter.  \u2022 The administrator in the Office of Residence Life and Housing Services will make a determination as to whether the student is responsible for the alleged violations and make a determination as to student conduct interventions/sanctions, if any, that are to be imposed.  \u2022 The student is notified in writing of the outcome, including any sanctions imposed.     b. If the matter involves alleged violations of Residence Hall policies as well as University policies, or if the behavioral record of the student alleged to have engaged in the volatile action is such that the resolution of a matter could involve a sanction of dismissal from University Housing, the matter may be referred directly to the Office Community Standards. In such cases, the matter will be addressed utilizing the Residence Life Student Conduct Process.     5. Review Under Office of Community Standards University Student Conduct Process: Matters involving alleged violations of University policy and/or other matters referred to the Office of Community Standards addressed by the Office of Community Standards will be addressed as follows:     a. Phase #1: Consensual Resolution: Formal disciplinary charges will be issued and, if appropriate based upon the circumstances, there will be an attempt to resolve the matter through a set of terms by which the University is willing to resolve the matter without a formal hearing. The consensual resolution is an agreement between the accused student and the University that is considered to be a formal student conduct action, the terms of which shall be considered \u201cdisciplinary sanctions\u201d. In most matters, the consent of the Complainant is not required but the Complainant may be consulted with respect to the nature of the terms presented in the consensual resolution. (In cases involving a sexual assault, the victim/complainant will always be consulted) There are two levels of consensual resolution which may be utilized at the discretion of the Office of Community Standards:     \u2022 The consensual resolution may be rendered directly by the Director of Community Standards or his/her designee provided that a suspension, withdrawal or dismissal from the University is not among the terms.   \u2022 The consensual resolution shall be rendered by the Vice President for Student Affairs if the terms include a suspension, withdrawal or dismissal from the University.       [NOTE: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) permits a school to disclose to the harassed student information about the sanctions imposed upon a student who was found to have engaged in harassment when the sanction directly relates to the harassed student. This includes an order that the harasser stay away from the harassed student, or that the harasser is prohibited from attending school for a period of time, or transferred to other classes or another residence hall. Further, when the conduct involves allegations of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense, FERPA permits a postsecondary institution to disclose to the alleged victim the final results of a disciplinary proceeding against the alleged perpetrator, regardless of whether the institution concluded that a violation was committed. Disclosure of other information in the student\u2019s \u201ceducation record,\u201d including information about sanctions that do not relate to the harassed student, may result in a violation of FERPA.     b. Phase #2: University Judicial Board: If, for any reason, the Office of Community Standards deems a consensual resolution (described in paragraph 4. e.) unattainable or inappropriate, the case will be referred to the University Judicial Board for a formal hearing.

The Office of Community Standards manages the University Student Conduct Process through which alleged violations of University (Senate) policies are reviewed. The office also oversees the administration of conduct actions in several related venues.   The University Student Conduct Process is an internal administrative procedure that is not tantamount to a criminal or civil hearing and, as such, fundamentally differs in terms of purpose and procedures. The student conduct process is intended to be both educational and adjudicative. Thus, the role of the student conduct administrator/panel is not only to determine the responsibility of the student for violating a University policy and to impose appropriate disciplinary interventions but also to encourage the student to consider the implications of his/her actions and decision-making and to take steps to develop the capacity to refrain from such behavior in the future.   Disposition of Complaints Filed with the Office of Community Standards:   A staff member in the Office of Community Standards will review a complaint, report and other materials submitted to that office. Based upon the preliminary review, the Office of Community Standards, in consultation with the appropriate University offices, may make the determination to dispose of the matter as follows:     1. Dismissal: The matter may be dismissed if the facts alleged in the complaint, even if they are true, do not constitute a violation of a University policy or a policy of the academic or administrative unit in which the matter arose.   2. Non-Judicial Intervention: The matter may be resolved through a non-judicial intervention (e.g mediation, educational interventions, administrative actions) if, at the discretion of the University, such a course of action is deemed to be an appropriate manner in which to address the matter.   3. Referral To Alternate University Venue: The matter may be referred to a University office or process (e.g. an academic college/school, Study Away site, office, etc) that is deemed to be the more appropriate venue through which to address the matter.   4. Assignment to Venues/Processes Overseen by the Office of Community Standards:   a. Assignment to Office of Community Standards (University) Student Conduct Process: Matters involving alleged violations of University policies are managed through the University Student Conduct Process which is overseen by the Office of Community Standards.   b. Residential Life Student Conduct Process: Matters involving alleged violations of Residential Life policies are managed through the Residential Life Student Conduct Process which is overseen by the Office of Community Standards.   c. Non-Matriculated Summer Resident Process: Matters involving alleged violations of the summer housing license agreement by residents who are not matriculated students at the University are managed by Residential Life and Housing Services through a review by a departmental/building administrator who has the authority to render a final decision. Such cases/individuals are not subject to, or afforded the same rights and responsibilities of, the Residential Life Student Conduct Process.   d. Assignment to the Center for Student Activities, Leadership and Service (CSALS). Matters involving alleged violations of terms of recognition by recognized student organizations are managed through the CSALS Group Conduct Process which is overseen by the Office of Community Standards.   e. Assignment to a Study Away Site: Matters involving alleged violations of University policies by students at one of the University\u2019s Study Away Sites are managed through the Study Away Site Student Conduct Process.   f. Complaints of alleged sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and/or sexual harassment) which arise at the University, including at the Study Away Sites, are addressed by the Office of Community Standards as one component of the process for Reporting, Investigating, and Resolving Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Complaints Against Students.   Each student conduct venue at the University may conduct its proceedings in accordance with the established policies and procedures set forth by that particular administrative unit, school or division. Students involved in disciplinary proceedings are strongly advised to contact the appropriate administrative officer in the unit in which the proceeding is taking place to obtain a copy of the procedures being utilized in that venue.   Information about the above-noted policies and procedures utilized by the Office of Community Standards, the Department of Residential Life and Housing Services, the Office of Student Activities, and Study Away Sites is available below:        I. THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY STANDARDS: UNIVERSITY DISCIPLINARY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES   Matters involving alleged violations of the University Rules of Conduct and Rules for the Maintenance of Public Order that fall under Senate jurisdiction are addressed through the University Student Conduct Process .   Matters involving alleged violations of the University Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking are addressed through the Process for Reporting, Investigating, and Resolving Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Complaints Against Students            II. OFFICE OF RESIDENTIAL LIFE AND HOUSING SERVICES: ADMINISTRATIVE AND STUDENT CONDUCT, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES   Depending upon the nature of the alleged policy violation and the disciplinary record of the student, the review of alleged violations of Residential Life policies will be adjudicated through the Residential Life Student Conduct Process in one of the following ways:   A. If the alleged behavior caused significant disruption to the residential community or seriously compromised the safety or well-being of members of the residential community and/or if the disciplinary record of the student alleged to have engaged in the violative behavior places that student at risk for a sanction of dismissal from University Housing, the matter may be managed by an administrator in the Office of Community Standards.   B. If the alleged behavior caused significant disruption to the residential community or if the disciplinary record of the student alleged to have engaged in the violative behavior places that student at risk for a sanction of suspension or deferred suspension from University Housing, the matter may be managed by a senior administrator in the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services. In such cases, the matter will be addressed utilizing the Residential Life Student Conduct Process.   C. Other matters will be managed by an administrator in the residence hall in which the incident occurred or in which the students involved in the incident reside.   D. If the matter involves alleged violations of University policies as well as Residential Life policies, the matter may be referred directly to the Office of Community Standards and may be managed through the University Student Conduct Process.   The Residential Life Student Conduct Policies, Process, and Procedures are described in detail on the following webpage: Residential Life student conduct procedures .        III. THE CENTER FOR STUDENT ACTIVITIES, LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE: CLUB AND ORGANIZATION CONDUCT, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES (CSALS)   Acting under the guidance of the Office of Community Standards, this office has authority to consider matters involving actions by student clubs and organizations, including fraternities and sororities, thatviolate the terms of their recognition or University programming policies. Behavior by clubs or organizations, or theirindividual members, that compromises the academic or personal well-being of other members of the University community or which involves violations of University policy will be referred to the Office of Community Standards and Compliance. Depending upon the nature of the alleged violation, matters involving allegations of policy violations by a recognized student organization at the University will be addressed as follows:   A. If the alleged violation is of a University policy, the alleged actions of the group may be reviewed by the Office of Community Standards through the University Student Conduct Process and Procedures.   B. If the alleged violation is of a CSALS standard for recognition as a University Student Organization, for student group activities, or a standard of behavior adopted by the student groups themselves (eg. the Pillars of the Greek Community), the alleged actions of the group will be reviewed through the CSALS Student Group Conduct Process in consultation with the Office of Community Standards.   More information is available at: CSALS          IV. ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS AND UNITS   Each administrative office/unit at the University has the authority to address behavior that violates the policiesthat a student is obliged to follow with respect to his/her use of that particular office or service. For example, Coles Sports Center, Bobst Library, and Information Technology Services are examples of units/offices that may resolve complaints concerning astudent's non-adherence to the policies or procedures associated with the utilization of the services offered or administered by that respective office. Matters involving behavior that compromises the academic or personal well-being of students beyond the site orwhich involves violations of University policy that affect more than the site community may be referred to the Office of Community Standards and Compliance.          V. ACADEMIC SCHOOLS:   Each Academic School at New York University has jurisdiction over behavior which occurs within that School and affects the School community. Such matters may include questions of academic integrity as well as allegations of violations of other School or University policy. Please consult the handbook of the School to review its policies. Learn more .          VI. STUDENT DISCIPLINARY PROCESS FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED AT NYU's STUDY AWAY SITES/CAMPUSES:     Students who are studying away are responsible for abiding by the Study Away Standard as well as any other local policies. General matters involving alleged violations of University policies by students at one of the University\u2019s Study Away Sites are managed through the Study Away Site Student Conduct Process. Matters arising in New York involving students whose home campus is NYU-Abu Dhabi or NYU-Shanghai may be referred to Site Administrators or Global Program Administrators as the circumstances warrant. Information about the Study Away Site student conduct process is available at: The Study Away Site/Campus Student Conduct Process And Procedures .   Note: Complaints of alleged sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and/or sexual harassment) which arise at the University, including at the Study Away Sites, are addressed through the process for Reporting, Investigating, and Resolving Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Complaints Against Students                                     Please Note: The information presented on this page is intended to provide readers with a summary of the related University policies and procedures and should not be construed to serve as a substitute for the actual regulations. Readers are advised to consult the University Policies page to read the official NYU policies regarding the judicial process.              Disciplinary Jurisdictions:                                           At NYU, there is no single office that handles all disciplinary cases. A case may be handled in one of several \"jurisdictions\" depending on several primary factors.                               An overview of the various jurisdictions is as follows:   The University's formal disciplinary system is comprised of two primary jurisdictions under which an alleged policy violation may be considered. If a matter affects only one School, disciplinary action is carried out by the faculty and officers of that School. If a matter affects more than one school, then disciplinary action is carried out under the authority of the University Senate, through its designee the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs.   In addition to these two primary jurisdictions, if a matter involves a violation of the policies of a specific office/department which a student is obliged to follow with respect to his/her use of that particular office or service, and if the nature of the incident is relatively minor, then that office may take action as authorized, and in accordance with, its respective procedures. For example, the Residence Halls, Coles Sports Center, Bobst Library, and the Academic Computing Facility are examples of offices that may resolve complaints concerning behavior that relates to the student's use of the services offered or administered by that respective office. Questions regarding appropriate jurisdiction are referred to the University Office of Legal Counsel.   More Information .

General:    The following policies and procedures are those by which alleged violations of University student conduct policies will be reviewed and resolved through the University Student Conduct Process. Please note that these procedures do not apply in matters of complaints of alleged sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, relationship violence, and/or sexual harassment). Such complaints are addressed through the process for  Reporting, Investigating, and Resolving Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Complaints Against Students .       A. The Complaint:  Any member of the faculty, administration, or staff or any student may file a complaint against any student for a student offense with the Dean of the school in which the student complained of is enrolled or with the Vice President for Student Affairs. Although a complaint may be filed at any time, it is strongly preferred that the complaint be submitted as soon as possible after the reporter/complainant became aware of the matter. A complaint should include a description of the incident giving rise to the complaint, the identity of the accused student(s), and the names of others who may have been present, observed the incident, or who otherwise have information related to the matter. Notice of the filing of a formal complaint shall be mailed to the student within 48 hours.   NOTE:  1. A report submitted to the Department of Public Safety or another University office does  not constitute a student conduct complaint which automatically initiates a student conduct action.  2. A report filed by a staff member in Residential Life and Housing Services is considered to be a complaint for cases reviewed through the Residential Life student conduct process.  3. An academic school may have different procedures for filing a complaint. Readers are urged to contact the school for specific information.     B. Consideration of Interim Suspension:   As provided in by-law 62, the President or the Dean of a school, or their respective designees may determine to suspend the student who is accused of having violated University policy pending consideration of his/her case through the disciplinary process. In matters of Student Affairs jurisdiction, the President\u2019s designee shall be the Vice President for Student Affairs. A student should not be summarily suspended either completely or for certain purposes, except for reasons relating to his/her physical or emotional safety and well-being, the safety and well-being of students, faculty, or staff, or University property, the maintenance of public order, or the effective continuation of the education process. When this occurs, the student shall be afforded the opportunity to expedite disciplinary proceedings so as to enable the determination of the appropriate resolution at the earliest possible time. Any period of interim suspension shall be deducted from any ultimate sanction involving suspension. A student who has been subject to interim suspension and who is found \u201cnot responsible\u201d shall be allowed full opportunity to make up whatever work was missed due to the suspension.     C. Preliminary Investigation:  A staff member in the Office of Community Standards will commence the process of reviewing the complaint, report and other materials associated with the matter by contacting the Complainant or the person filing the report. The Director will also notify the student(s) named in the complaint or report to inform the student(s) of the filing of the complaint/report and request to meet with those individuals. During the respective meetings/discussions, the students (Complainant and Accused) shall be informed of their rights and responsibilities within the student conduct process, be apprised of the University\u2019s related procedures, and asked to discuss the incident giving rise to the report/complaint. The students may also be asked to submit (by a designated date) a written statement about the incident and to provide the name and contact information of any witnesses/others who might be able to offer information regarding the matter.     D. Disposition:  Based upon the preliminary investigation, the Office of Community Standards, at its sole discretion, will make the determination as to the appropriate disposition of the matter through one of the following courses of action:     1. Dismissal: The report/complaint will be dismissed if it appears not to have merit or even if the facts alleged in the complaint are true there would be no violation of a University policy.     2. Referral: The matter will be referred to another University office or process if that office or process is thought to be the more appropriate venue through which to address the matter.     3. Non-Judicial Intervention: At the discretion of the Office of Community Standards, the matter may be resolved through a non-judicial intervention (e.g. mediation, educational interventions, administrative actions) if it is deemed to be of a minor nature that is appropriately addressed in such a manner.     4. Review Under Residence Life Student Conduct Process: http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/get-to-know-yourhome/judicial-information.html     a. If the matter involves only alleged violations of Residence Hall policies, the matter will be adjudicated through the appropriate administrator on the Department of Residence Life and Housing Services, acting under the guidance/supervision of the Office of Community Standards using the Residence Life disciplinary policies and procedures. A summary of this process is as follows:     \u2022 The administrator in the Office of Residence Life and Housing Services reviews the report and investigates the matter to determine if there is any alleged violation of residence hall policy.  \u2022 The administrator in the Office of Residence Life and Housing Services will meet with the student who is alleged to have violated the residence hall policies and with others who have knowledge of the matter.  \u2022 The administrator in the Office of Residence Life and Housing Services will make a determination as to whether the student is responsible for the alleged violations and make a determination as to student conduct interventions/sanctions, if any, that are to be imposed.  \u2022 The student is notified in writing of the outcome, including any sanctions imposed.     b. If the matter involves alleged violations of Residence Hall policies as well as University policies, or if the behavioral record of the student alleged to have engaged in the volatile action is such that the resolution of a matter could involve a sanction of dismissal from University Housing, the matter may be referred directly to the Office Community Standards. In such cases, the matter will be addressed utilizing the Residence Life Student Conduct Process.     5. Review Under Office of Community Standards University Student Conduct Process: Matters involving alleged violations of University policy and/or other matters referred to the Office of Community Standards addressed by the Office of Community Standards will be addressed as follows:     a. Phase #1: Consensual Resolution: Formal disciplinary charges will be issued and, if appropriate based upon the circumstances, there will be an attempt to resolve the matter through a set of terms by which the University is willing to resolve the matter without a formal hearing. The consensual resolution is an agreement between the accused student and the University that is considered to be a formal student conduct action, the terms of which shall be considered \u201cdisciplinary sanctions\u201d. In most matters, the consent of the Complainant is not required but the Complainant may be consulted with respect to the nature of the terms presented in the consensual resolution. (In cases involving a sexual assault, the victim/complainant will always be consulted) There are two levels of consensual resolution which may be utilized at the discretion of the Office of Community Standards:     \u2022 The consensual resolution may be rendered directly by the Director of Community Standards or his/her designee provided that a suspension, withdrawal or dismissal from the University is not among the terms.   \u2022 The consensual resolution shall be rendered by the Vice President for Student Affairs if the terms include a suspension, withdrawal or dismissal from the University.       [NOTE: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) permits a school to disclose to the harassed student information about the sanctions imposed upon a student who was found to have engaged in harassment when the sanction directly relates to the harassed student. This includes an order that the harasser stay away from the harassed student, or that the harasser is prohibited from attending school for a period of time, or transferred to other classes or another residence hall. Further, when the conduct involves allegations of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense, FERPA permits a postsecondary institution to disclose to the alleged victim the final results of a disciplinary proceeding against the alleged perpetrator, regardless of whether the institution concluded that a violation was committed. Disclosure of other information in the student\u2019s \u201ceducation record,\u201d including information about sanctions that do not relate to the harassed student, may result in a violation of FERPA.     b. Phase #2: University Judicial Board: If, for any reason, the Office of Community Standards deems a consensual resolution (described in paragraph 4. e.) unattainable or inappropriate, the case will be referred to the University Judicial Board for a formal hearing.

The Office of Community Standards manages the University Student Conduct Process through which alleged violations of University (Senate) policies are reviewed. The office also oversees the administration of conduct actions in several related venues.   The University Student Conduct Process is an internal administrative procedure that is not tantamount to a criminal or civil hearing and, as such, fundamentally differs in terms of purpose and procedures. The student conduct process is intended to be both educational and adjudicative. Thus, the role of the student conduct administrator/panel is not only to determine the responsibility of the student for violating a University policy and to impose appropriate disciplinary interventions but also to encourage the student to consider the implications of his/her actions and decision-making and to take steps to develop the capacity to refrain from such behavior in the future.   Disposition of Complaints Filed with the Office of Community Standards:   A staff member in the Office of Community Standards will review a complaint, report and other materials submitted to that office. Based upon the preliminary review, the Office of Community Standards, in consultation with the appropriate University offices, may make the determination to dispose of the matter as follows:     1. Dismissal: The matter may be dismissed if the facts alleged in the complaint, even if they are true, do not constitute a violation of a University policy or a policy of the academic or administrative unit in which the matter arose.   2. Non-Judicial Intervention: The matter may be resolved through a non-judicial intervention (e.g mediation, educational interventions, administrative actions) if, at the discretion of the University, such a course of action is deemed to be an appropriate manner in which to address the matter.   3. Referral To Alternate University Venue: The matter may be referred to a University office or process (e.g. an academic college/school, Study Away site, office, etc) that is deemed to be the more appropriate venue through which to address the matter.   4. Assignment to Venues/Processes Overseen by the Office of Community Standards:   a. Assignment to Office of Community Standards (University) Student Conduct Process: Matters involving alleged violations of University policies are managed through the University Student Conduct Process which is overseen by the Office of Community Standards.   b. Residential Life Student Conduct Process: Matters involving alleged violations of Residential Life policies are managed through the Residential Life Student Conduct Process which is overseen by the Office of Community Standards.   c. Non-Matriculated Summer Resident Process: Matters involving alleged violations of the summer housing license agreement by residents who are not matriculated students at the University are managed by Residential Life and Housing Services through a review by a departmental/building administrator who has the authority to render a final decision. Such cases/individuals are not subject to, or afforded the same rights and responsibilities of, the Residential Life Student Conduct Process.   d. Assignment to the Center for Student Activities, Leadership and Service (CSALS). Matters involving alleged violations of terms of recognition by recognized student organizations are managed through the CSALS Group Conduct Process which is overseen by the Office of Community Standards.   e. Assignment to a Study Away Site: Matters involving alleged violations of University policies by students at one of the University\u2019s Study Away Sites are managed through the Study Away Site Student Conduct Process.   f. Complaints of alleged sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and/or sexual harassment) which arise at the University, including at the Study Away Sites, are addressed by the Office of Community Standards as one component of the process for Reporting, Investigating, and Resolving Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Complaints Against Students.   Each student conduct venue at the University may conduct its proceedings in accordance with the established policies and procedures set forth by that particular administrative unit, school or division. Students involved in disciplinary proceedings are strongly advised to contact the appropriate administrative officer in the unit in which the proceeding is taking place to obtain a copy of the procedures being utilized in that venue.   Information about the above-noted policies and procedures utilized by the Office of Community Standards, the Department of Residential Life and Housing Services, the Office of Student Activities, and Study Away Sites is available below:        I. THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY STANDARDS: UNIVERSITY DISCIPLINARY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES   Matters involving alleged violations of the University Rules of Conduct and Rules for the Maintenance of Public Order that fall under Senate jurisdiction are addressed through the University Student Conduct Process .   Matters involving alleged violations of the University Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking are addressed through the Process for Reporting, Investigating, and Resolving Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Complaints Against Students            II. OFFICE OF RESIDENTIAL LIFE AND HOUSING SERVICES: ADMINISTRATIVE AND STUDENT CONDUCT, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES   Depending upon the nature of the alleged policy violation and the disciplinary record of the student, the review of alleged violations of Residential Life policies will be adjudicated through the Residential Life Student Conduct Process in one of the following ways:   A. If the alleged behavior caused significant disruption to the residential community or seriously compromised the safety or well-being of members of the residential community and/or if the disciplinary record of the student alleged to have engaged in the violative behavior places that student at risk for a sanction of dismissal from University Housing, the matter may be managed by an administrator in the Office of Community Standards.   B. If the alleged behavior caused significant disruption to the residential community or if the disciplinary record of the student alleged to have engaged in the violative behavior places that student at risk for a sanction of suspension or deferred suspension from University Housing, the matter may be managed by a senior administrator in the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services. In such cases, the matter will be addressed utilizing the Residential Life Student Conduct Process.   C. Other matters will be managed by an administrator in the residence hall in which the incident occurred or in which the students involved in the incident reside.   D. If the matter involves alleged violations of University policies as well as Residential Life policies, the matter may be referred directly to the Office of Community Standards and may be managed through the University Student Conduct Process.   The Residential Life Student Conduct Policies, Process, and Procedures are described in detail on the following webpage: Residential Life student conduct procedures .        III. THE CENTER FOR STUDENT ACTIVITIES, LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE: CLUB AND ORGANIZATION CONDUCT, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES (CSALS)   Acting under the guidance of the Office of Community Standards, this office has authority to consider matters involving actions by student clubs and organizations, including fraternities and sororities, thatviolate the terms of their recognition or University programming policies. Behavior by clubs or organizations, or theirindividual members, that compromises the academic or personal well-being of other members of the University community or which involves violations of University policy will be referred to the Office of Community Standards and Compliance. Depending upon the nature of the alleged violation, matters involving allegations of policy violations by a recognized student organization at the University will be addressed as follows:   A. If the alleged violation is of a University policy, the alleged actions of the group may be reviewed by the Office of Community Standards through the University Student Conduct Process and Procedures.   B. If the alleged violation is of a CSALS standard for recognition as a University Student Organization, for student group activities, or a standard of behavior adopted by the student groups themselves (eg. the Pillars of the Greek Community), the alleged actions of the group will be reviewed through the CSALS Student Group Conduct Process in consultation with the Office of Community Standards.   More information is available at: CSALS          IV. ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS AND UNITS   Each administrative office/unit at the University has the authority to address behavior that violates the policiesthat a student is obliged to follow with respect to his/her use of that particular office or service. For example, Coles Sports Center, Bobst Library, and Information Technology Services are examples of units/offices that may resolve complaints concerning astudent's non-adherence to the policies or procedures associated with the utilization of the services offered or administered by that respective office. Matters involving behavior that compromises the academic or personal well-being of students beyond the site orwhich involves violations of University policy that affect more than the site community may be referred to the Office of Community Standards and Compliance.          V. ACADEMIC SCHOOLS:   Each Academic School at New York University has jurisdiction over behavior which occurs within that School and affects the School community. Such matters may include questions of academic integrity as well as allegations of violations of other School or University policy. Please consult the handbook of the School to review its policies. Learn more .          VI. STUDENT DISCIPLINARY PROCESS FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED AT NYU's STUDY AWAY SITES/CAMPUSES:     Students who are studying away are responsible for abiding by the Study Away Standard as well as any other local policies. General matters involving alleged violations of University policies by students at one of the University\u2019s Study Away Sites are managed through the Study Away Site Student Conduct Process. Matters arising in New York involving students whose home campus is NYU-Abu Dhabi or NYU-Shanghai may be referred to Site Administrators or Global Program Administrators as the circumstances warrant. Information about the Study Away Site student conduct process is available at: The Study Away Site/Campus Student Conduct Process And Procedures .   Note: Complaints of alleged sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and/or sexual harassment) which arise at the University, including at the Study Away Sites, are addressed through the process for Reporting, Investigating, and Resolving Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Complaints Against Students                                     Please Note: The information presented on this page is intended to provide readers with a summary of the related University policies and procedures and should not be construed to serve as a substitute for the actual regulations. Readers are advised to consult the University Policies page to read the official NYU policies regarding the judicial process.              Disciplinary Jurisdictions:                                           At NYU, there is no single office that handles all disciplinary cases. A case may be handled in one of several \"jurisdictions\" depending on several primary factors.                               An overview of the various jurisdictions is as follows:   The University's formal disciplinary system is comprised of two primary jurisdictions under which an alleged policy violation may be considered. If a matter affects only one School, disciplinary action is carried out by the faculty and officers of that School. If a matter affects more than one school, then disciplinary action is carried out under the authority of the University Senate, through its designee the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs.   In addition to these two primary jurisdictions, if a matter involves a violation of the policies of a specific office/department which a student is obliged to follow with respect to his/her use of that particular office or service, and if the nature of the incident is relatively minor, then that office may take action as authorized, and in accordance with, its respective procedures. For example, the Residence Halls, Coles Sports Center, Bobst Library, and the Academic Computing Facility are examples of offices that may resolve complaints concerning behavior that relates to the student's use of the services offered or administered by that respective office. Questions regarding appropriate jurisdiction are referred to the University Office of Legal Counsel.   More Information .
