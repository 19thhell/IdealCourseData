For this work, we use approaches that span systems biology, comparative functional genomics & bioinformatic analysis focusing on model organisms and phylogenetically related species. The research involves the combined skills of genomicists, bioinformaticians, systematists, and evolutionary biologists all working together.

We develop design patterns for effective educational games that industry partners can draw on to assure high quality when designing their own games for learning. Our current focus is on games that teach science, technology, engineering and mathematics to middle school students.
