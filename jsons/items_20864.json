Required Courses   TR-GY 6013 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) TR-GY 6313 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) TR-GY 6323 ( Please refer to the bulletin )     Select 1    3.00 Credits Design of Parking & Terminal Facilities TR-GY 7323 This course covers design techniques and approaches to a variety of pedestrian and vehicular needs in conjunction with access to land functions. Parking serves as the primary access interface to many land facilities, from shopping centers and sports facilities, to medium- and high-density residential developments. The planning and design of parking facilities, and the planning of access and egress from these facilities, is critical to the economic success of a development. Terminals are inter-modal interface facilities involving the transfer of people and/or goods from one mode of transportation to another. This course covers essential elements of terminal planning and design, including transit stations and terminals, major goods terminals at ports and railheads and others. The design of pedestrian space and ways within terminal structures is also treated Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. TR-GY 7343 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) 3.00 Credits Multimodal Transportation Safety TR-GY 7033 Technology, legislation and market forces have contributed to improved transportation safety for decades. But one must consider which metrics are most relevant for which modes, the role of demographics and traffic levels and other factors when analyzing and predicting safety trends. The course pays attention to a systems view, to metrics by mode and to both standard field and statistical analyses. Consistent with current priorities, the course addresses security as well as safety issues. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. 3.00 Credits Intelligent Transportation Systems and Their Applications TR-GY 6223 This course introduces the concepts and applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its growing role in the management of transportation systems. The course stresses the role of ITS as national policy, as specified in major transportation funding legislation \u2013 ISTEA, TEA21 and SAFETY-LU. A systems engineering approach to overall development of ITS technologies is stressed. Major components of ITS are discussed, and examples of their application treated. Coordination and integration of ITS components are treated. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor.
