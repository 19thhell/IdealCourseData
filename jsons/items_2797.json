When the lights come up, the sound editor asks Lee what he thought, and the soft-spoken 53-year-old furrows his brow. Finally, he says, &ldquo;Maybe the music was a little too loud against the dialogue.&rdquo; This tendency to process, to meditate rather than react immediately, is part of what makes the Academy Award-winning director one of film's most eclectic and exacting artists.                  Ironically, it was an early, profound experience with failure that originally set him on the course to filmmaking. Lee's inability to pass Taiwan's college entrance exam&mdash;twice&mdash;steered him to art school in 1972 at age 18. At the National Taiwan University of Arts, he became enamored with music, dance, and theater, and made his first short on Super 8 film. And then one night, while walking in the rain after play rehearsal, he had an epiphany: He realized that he was different than others and had no choice but to devote himself to being an artist. \"It was enlightening,\" Lee explains. \"I felt this chill in my bones. I was lifted.\"     The decision didn't necessarily make life easy. His father was an old-fashioned disciplinarian, principal of one of Taiwan's best high schools, who put no value in artistic ventures. Having fled China with his wife in 1949 after the civil war, he stressed education and the Chinese classics. But when Lee was accepted into the BFA theater program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, his father happily supported him, hoping he'd come to his senses after earning his degree. That didn't happen. Upon graduation, Lee, who found film a more flexible medium than theater because of his limited English, applied to all the top American graduate schools&mdash;only gaining acceptance to NYU.      It's safe to say that those other admissions officers are still kicking themselves. After 10 acclaimed films and 59 international awards&mdash;including two Golden Globes, two BAFTAs, and two Independent Spirit Awards&mdash;Lee is lauded as perhaps the most versatile director from Hollywood to Bollywood. He wrote his first two scripts while working as a stay-at-home dad, eventually sending Pushing Hands (1992) and The Wedding Banquet (1993), both examinations of Chinese cultural and generational divides, to a Taiwanese government writing competition, in which he placed first and second, respectively. This success earned him a chance to direct both films, which were hits in Taiwan and the West. The Wedding Banquet and the subsequent Taiwanese family drama Eat Drink Man Woman (1994) both garnered Oscar nominations for best foreign film, which opened the door to more diverse directing gigs, such as the adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility (1995), the angst-ridden suburban meditation The Ice Storm (1997), and the Civil War tale Ride With the Devil (1999).          &ldquo;Making movies is not about a statement, but raising interesting questions to stir up the [audience&rsquo;s] mind&hellip;. Movies these days,  especially studio movies, they don't  allow people to think. To me, that's a crime.&rdquo;   &mdash;Director Ang Lee               PHOTOS FROM LEFT: DESPITE THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING  BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN , THE TALE OF TWO STAR-CROSSED COWBOYS, PLAYED BY JAKE GYLLENHAAL AND HEATH LEDGER, EARNED LEE HIS FIRST OSCAR FOR DIRECTING. | USING COMPUTER-GENERATED IMAGERY, LEE TRANSFORMED ACTOR ERIC BANA INTO THE NOT-SO-JOLLY GREEN GIANT IN  HULK , THE FIRST BIG-SCREEN ADAPTATION OF THE MARVEL COMIC-BOOK HERO. | THE RITUALS OF FOOD AND LOVE SPICE THE LIFE OF A CONTEMPORARY TAIWANESE FAMILY IN EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN , WHICH LEE CO-WROTE WITH LONGTIME COLLABORATOR JAMES SCHAMUS.                        In Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Lee crafted a sweeping martial arts epic with an art house sensibility. The picture earned 10 Oscar nominations, with four wins, and became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time. His split-screened, emotionally nuanced interpretation of Hulk (2003) also blazed trails in the conventional comic-book film tradition, but it was Brokeback Mountain (2005), a story of forbidden love between two cowboys, that created the biggest stir. Infused with the glory of the most stunning Westerns, Lee staged a tale that had American critics and audiences talking all year. But the film almost didn't happen. Haunted by guilt for his negative depiction of the Hulk's father and frustrated by his uncharacteristically hot temper on the set, he flirted with quitting the business after that movie. Sensing his son's depression and disillusionment, Lee's father actually encouraged him, for the very first time, to get back behind the camera.     While accepting the Academy Award for Best Achievement in Directing for the film, Lee said that Brokeback was about \"not just all the gay men and women whose love is denied by society, but just as important, the greatness of love itself.\" He also made a special dedication to his father, who died just as the movie began production: \"More than any other, I made this film for him.\"     NYU Alumni Magazine recently spoke to Lee at Sound One Studios in New York while he put the finishing touches on Lust, Caution , which recently took the top prize at the Venice Film Festival and opened in theaters in September.                Your English was quite limited when you started film school, but people took notice of you right away. Fellow student Spike Lee even used you as  an assistant director on his thesis project. How did you manage to  attract everyone's attention?   I'm normally a quiet person but when I direct, people tend to listen to me. You know, it's like gang members. It doesn't matter if someone is big or small. If you tell people what to do, and those people survive, they tend to listen to you. Same thing. After school I was doing little jobs for a Chinese TV crew. I would start out in the morning as the lighting person, and by the afternoon, the director would be listening to me [ laughs ].     What did you say that made these people listen?  I don't know. Up to directing Sense and Sensibility , I could hardly finish a fluent sentence in English. And this was Jane Austen, with a top-of-the-line English cast and crew. How did I do that? It's hard to explain. But that gave me faith in moviemaking, that it's a universal experience. It can penetrate cultural barriers, language barriers. There's something universal about sight and sound. It made me feel anything was doable. And like I belonged.     So how did things change after making Sense and Sensibility ?  After that, in terms of filmmaking, I was pretty well-grounded. I could face my father and say, 'I have a job.' I could sound like I knew what I was doing. But then I had to make The Ice Storm . I had to break that. It's like the Taoist saying: 'You have to change.' If you don't change, you're dead, you get stiff. That's a sign of decline and a big fear for me. I had fans who liked my movies, but you sort of have to break that contract with them. You have to remind yourself that making movies is about looking for freedom. It's risky, it's scary. Somebody will say, 'I loved Sense and Sensibility ,' and then you pitch them The Ice Storm and they're like, 'What are you doing to me?' But if I don't do that, if I make Sense and Sensibility , and then [director John Madden's] Shakespeare in Love next, I feel it gets stiff.

How much does Taoism influence the films you choose to make?  Being Chinese, I just naturally grapple with Taoist thoughts and self-doubt because there's always something three feet above your head&mdash;there's something watching, something bigger than you. So you're never sure about yourself because you're the little human, and what are we compared to the big natural laws? People think Taoism is pessimistic, that you just follow whatever, flow with the wave and do nothing. But nature takes its own course. You live, you die. You know, it never puts humanity first. Humanity is about how we fit in; it's not about conquering.         You're known as a great but gentle leader on sets. Did your father, who was a high school principal, have an affect on how you manage others?  Starting with Hulk , when I would lose my patience, I [realized I] could have a big temper like my father [ laughs ]. He was a very stately man, very decisive. I didn't like how he would treat my mother sometimes. He was tough, very traditional. My wife, she dominates me [ laughs ]. She makes the rules, and she's smart and very independent. But somehow, like during Hulk , you realize the family genes are so strong. You've got the same physical problems; you get the same temper. You know there's no escape, and now I have to repress that a little bit.    You don't want to just go barking at people to make them afraid of you. That's not me. You make people listen to you by reasoning. I think it takes greater confidence in yourself to tell people, 'Give me a moment' or 'I changed my mind' or 'I don't know what I'm gonna do yet. Wait a little bit and let me just sort it out.'      You were a huge admirer of the late Ingmar Bergman. How did watching his film The Virgin Spring change your life, as you've said?  That film put the doubt of God in me. I was 18 when I saw it, and it's brutal. It took away my innocence, so to speak. I can't make a Bergman movie, but I realized then that movies could have that spirit in them. And just last summer [2006] I got to meet him. It was like a pilgrimage. He gave me a hug, and his hug was so motherly. It was very soft.&hellip; Thirty-five years ago this man took away my innocence, and now he's giving me a very motherly hug. It was like&hellip;life is okay.      You met him as a fan, but he was probably a fan of yours, too.  He loved quite a few of my movies, so that was&hellip;I don't know how to describe it. It was beyond nice.      Is there something you're trying to give to your audience, just like Bergman gave to you? Are you trying to make them leave the theater with a certain feeling?  With doubt. I think it's embodied in me, and each movie. Making movies is not about a statement, but raising interesting questions to stir up the [audience's] mind. I think that's what movies should do. Movies these days, especially studio movies, they don't allow people to think. To me, that's a crime.      So you usually look for thought-provoking scripts?  Most scripts are built like battleships, unsinkable. They're for producers, for investors. They give you a lot of security, like, 'How can we go wrong with this? How big a schmuck can you be if you fuck that up?' [ laughs ] Most scripts I get are like that. You can go to war with them, but that's not for me. They're not interesting. They should be simple, but a lot of writers, they don't do that. That's why I work with James Schamus a lot, because his [scripts] are underwritten.     You're known as a shy person in social situations and have called filmmaking an escape. What are you hiding from?  Well, I'm just good at filmmaking. I'm not very good at, you know, being social [ laughs ] or a lot of other things. So, just naturally, if I'm making a film, it's positive reinforcement, and other things can be a negative reinforcement. I'm a daydreamer. I think a lot of creative people are like that. I don't know why I'm shy at parties. Maybe because I don't have enough knowledge to carry on an interesting conversation&mdash;unless it's related to filmmaking [ laughs ].      I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with that.  I don't know. But when it relates to filmmaking, I get crazy. I get really fanatic about [film] research, and then I sound smart. That's a pleasure for me. I like making movies, and the rest of my life is rather boring. It's true.     You're a uniquely international filmmaker. What do you do that makes your stories appeal to such broad audiences?  Whatever it takes to make a movie interesting, I'll do it. [For Lust, Caution ] I have a French composer, a Mexican cinematographer, whatever works. And if the script doesn't go well, then James [Schamus], the American, will help out through translation. If you just make a film for a Chinese audience, you don't have to worry about who doesn't know the background. But if you think it's going out to the world, you have to think twice about it, you have to make adjustments. That I do.      But it seems like you tap into something else that resonates across all audiences, a sense of longing or searching.  Maybe it's because I drift around. My parents drifted from China to Taiwan, and then I came to the States, and now I go back to China, where things are changing. Taiwan's also changed. Things are constantly changed.   I was always on a losing side. It's easy for me to identify with losers because I've always had to adapt, I've always had to blend, and that's just my life. It's not like I'm American or Japanese or German, where you have very strong defining roots. I don't. My root is the tradition of Chinese culture, which [as a child] I never saw, I was only told.      Is it this theme of being on the losing side that's most relatable for people?  There is something universal about that. I think through movies we try to discover truths about life. We use different materials, different channels to think about essential questions, deeper questions. This search for truth should be universal.    There's another thing that's universal about the film world today, which is different from when I was a student. There's more film consistency now; there's a crust of universality among the global art house lines. There's a certain standard taste you have to meet that is not a whole lot different from Japan to Brazil to China.     What do you think caused that?  Well, we all learn from the same things. There's a global village, the information flows so fast now. The taste is less local I think at the film festival level, at the art house level.      After fleeing China, your parents were never secure, even once they prospered in Taiwan. In the fickle world of entertainment, do you still get the feeling that at any moment your success could come to a halt?  I've had a lot of goodwill, so I'm quite satisfied. Whatever happens, I'm just trying not to mess it up. I cherish it. But sometimes, when it comes to the Academy, I cannot say I don't really care [about success] because when you make a movie, you lead many people. Everybody comes in with a dream, and I feel responsible to make everybody happy. So I still go as far as I can.     How has being Taiwan-born affected your experience in Hollywood?  I thought, being Chinese, I had to be twice as good to get half as much. I just told myself that's probably what it's gonna be. It turns out it's not as hard [to be a Chinese director]. In some ways I feel lucky because I got help from the Taiwanese government&mdash;and my classmates from America, they didn't get help from the American government [ laughs ].      Alienation and regret are central themes in the lives of your characters. What do you want people to learn from this?  They have to deal with it. They have to face it. I think that's what [my] films suggest, because nothing is reliable, nothing stands still. My movies are all about certain systems, certain beliefs, certain relationships&mdash;the things that people try to hang on to, especially. They get disappointed in the end. It's like Brokeback [ Mountain ]; you never really get back to it, you just try.     Do you consciously try to put those sentiments into your stories?  They're just my feelings about life. I think the phrase that puts it best was by Jane Austen in Sense and Sensibility : It's personal free will versus social obligations. You have to fulfill obligations to be grounded, to relate to people, to live with other people, to feel their company so you're not lonely. But at the same time, you want to break from it because that's not freedom. In all my films, at the end of the day, it's like religion: You always look for  the answer, for the ultimate freedom. What is the ultimate freedom? For me, it's making movies. With art, we try to break free, but there's no such thing [ laughs ]. Unless you choose to die, there's no freedom.     You've said that you hope to live to 300, so you can keep making movies.  Are there any particular stories you're anxious to tell?  I don't have a checklist. I like making movies, and I think I have a good appetite for it. I just want to keep learning.

It was beyond nice.      Is there something you're trying to give to your audience, just like Bergman gave to you? Are you trying to make them leave the theater with a certain feeling?  With doubt. I think it's embodied in me, and each movie. Making movies is not about a statement, but raising interesting questions to stir up the [audience's] mind. I think that's what movies should do. Movies these days, especially studio movies, they don't allow people to think. To me, that's a crime.      So you usually look for thought-provoking scripts?  Most scripts are built like battleships, unsinkable. They're for producers, for investors. They give you a lot of security, like, 'How can we go wrong with this? How big a schmuck can you be if you fuck that up?' [ laughs ] Most scripts I get are like that. You can go to war with them, but that's not for me. They're not interesting. They should be simple, but a lot of writers, they don't do that. That's why I work with James Schamus a lot, because his [scripts] are underwritten.     You're known as a shy person in social situations and have called filmmaking an escape. What are you hiding from?  Well, I'm just good at filmmaking. I'm not very good at, you know, being social [ laughs ] or a lot of other things. So, just naturally, if I'm making a film, it's positive reinforcement, and other things can be a negative reinforcement. I'm a daydreamer. I think a lot of creative people are like that. I don't know why I'm shy at parties. Maybe because I don't have enough knowledge to carry on an interesting conversation&mdash;unless it's related to filmmaking [ laughs ].      I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with that.  I don't know. But when it relates to filmmaking, I get crazy. I get really fanatic about [film] research, and then I sound smart. That's a pleasure for me. I like making movies, and the rest of my life is rather boring. It's true.     You're a uniquely international filmmaker. What do you do that makes your stories appeal to such broad audiences?  Whatever it takes to make a movie interesting, I'll do it. [For Lust, Caution ] I have a French composer, a Mexican cinematographer, whatever works. And if the script doesn't go well, then James [Schamus], the American, will help out through translation. If you just make a film for a Chinese audience, you don't have to worry about who doesn't know the background. But if you think it's going out to the world, you have to think twice about it, you have to make adjustments. That I do.      But it seems like you tap into something else that resonates across all audiences, a sense of longing or searching.  Maybe it's because I drift around. My parents drifted from China to Taiwan, and then I came to the States, and now I go back to China, where things are changing. Taiwan's also changed. Things are constantly changed.   I was always on a losing side. It's easy for me to identify with losers because I've always had to adapt, I've always had to blend, and that's just my life. It's not like I'm American or Japanese or German, where you have very strong defining roots. I don't. My root is the tradition of Chinese culture, which [as a child] I never saw, I was only told.      Is it this theme of being on the losing side that's most relatable for people?  There is something universal about that. I think through movies we try to discover truths about life. We use different materials, different channels to think about essential questions, deeper questions. This search for truth should be universal.    There's another thing that's universal about the film world today, which is different from when I was a student. There's more film consistency now; there's a crust of universality among the global art house lines. There's a certain standard taste you have to meet that is not a whole lot different from Japan to Brazil to China.     What do you think caused that?  Well, we all learn from the same things. There's a global village, the information flows so fast now. The taste is less local I think at the film festival level, at the art house level.      After fleeing China, your parents were never secure, even once they prospered in Taiwan. In the fickle world of entertainment, do you still get the feeling that at any moment your success could come to a halt?  I've had a lot of goodwill, so I'm quite satisfied. Whatever happens, I'm just trying not to mess it up. I cherish it. But sometimes, when it comes to the Academy, I cannot say I don't really care [about success] because when you make a movie, you lead many people. Everybody comes in with a dream, and I feel responsible to make everybody happy. So I still go as far as I can.     How has being Taiwan-born affected your experience in Hollywood?  I thought, being Chinese, I had to be twice as good to get half as much. I just told myself that's probably what it's gonna be. It turns out it's not as hard [to be a Chinese director]. In some ways I feel lucky because I got help from the Taiwanese government&mdash;and my classmates from America, they didn't get help from the American government [ laughs ].      Alienation and regret are central themes in the lives of your characters. What do you want people to learn from this?  They have to deal with it. They have to face it. I think that's what [my] films suggest, because nothing is reliable, nothing stands still. My movies are all about certain systems, certain beliefs, certain relationships&mdash;the things that people try to hang on to, especially. They get disappointed in the end. It's like Brokeback [ Mountain ]; you never really get back to it, you just try.     Do you consciously try to put those sentiments into your stories?  They're just my feelings about life. I think the phrase that puts it best was by Jane Austen in Sense and Sensibility : It's personal free will versus social obligations. You have to fulfill obligations to be grounded, to relate to people, to live with other people, to feel their company so you're not lonely. But at the same time, you want to break from it because that's not freedom. In all my films, at the end of the day, it's like religion: You always look for  the answer, for the ultimate freedom. What is the ultimate freedom? For me, it's making movies. With art, we try to break free, but there's no such thing [ laughs ]. Unless you choose to die, there's no freedom.     You've said that you hope to live to 300, so you can keep making movies.  Are there any particular stories you're anxious to tell?  I don't have a checklist. I like making movies, and I think I have a good appetite for it. I just want to keep learning.

Race, \"Difference,\" and Social Inequality      ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Khan. 4 points.   Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.    Reimagining Community: Race, Nation, and the Politics of Belonging    ANTH-UA 325 Identical to SCA-UA 200. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor.

Comparative materials illustrate theories of disputes and dispute resolution, examining the power of language and the language of power in a variety of settings (e.g., mediation, arbitration, trials). Class includes fieldwork trips to small claims court. Students audio-record cases and transcribe and analyze them according to different analytic perspectives. Bilingual students are encouraged to focus on cases that use interpreters.    Gender, Violence, and the Law    ANTH-UA 330 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Examines the global prevalence of gender violence and the varied meanings of violence against women and changes in terminology over time. Examines ways of theorizing gender and violence, including performative ideas of gender. The creation of gender violence as a social problem is a product of social movements in the United States, Europe, India, and many other parts of the world. It is now understood globally as an important human rights violation. Also examines the forms of intervention that have been developed in the United States and globally for diminishing violence against women, including policing, prosecution, and punishment.    Human Rights and Culture    ANTH-UA 331 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous peoples' rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the meanings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropological analysis of these situations. The goal of the course is developing an understanding of human rights in practice.    Body, Gender, and Belief in China    ANTH-UA 350 Identical to RELST-UA 350.

Analyses of secondary monographs are combined with work in primary sources.    Belief and Social Life in China    ANTH-UA 351 Identical to RELST-UA 351. Zito. 4 points.   The Chinese word for \"religion\" means \"teaching.\" Explores what Chinese people \"taught\" themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. Examines in historical perspective the classic texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; Buddhist, especially Ch'an (Zen). Discusses the practices of filiality in Buddhism, Confucian orthodoxy, and folk religion.    Transnationalism and Anthropology    ANTH-UA 400 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Das, Ganti, Khan. 4 points.   Examines what is considered \"new\" in the ongoing reconstruction of world order and its accompanying disorder. Also examines how this changes the ways people earn their livelihoods; how cultures are transmitted and hybridized; how migrating populations maintain connections to their homelands; how group identities are constructed and asserted; and how social movements around newly politicized issues arise. Discusses changing roles of nation-states and the growing significance of transnational, diasporic, and globalized social relations and cultural forms.    Culture Through Food    ANTH-UA 410 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers. 4 points.   Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.      Roma in East Central Europe   ANTH-UA 9200 Offered at NYU Prague. 4 points.   Introduces students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority to the emergence of Romany organizations, with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe.

Barbarian Europe    ANTH-UA 217 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.    African Archaeology    ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). Tryon. 4 points.   With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the experiences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situating the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food production, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent.    Discovering Archaeology in New York City    ANTH-UA 225 Wright. 4 points.   In this course, New York City is our archaeological site. The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage. Last Hunters-First Farmers ANTH-UA 608 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or instructor permission. Offered every two years. 4 points. Last   Hunters-First Farmers explores the transition from foraging to   agriculture throughout the Eastern Hemisphere and the Americas. The   course begins with a review of the theories that have been proposed to   explain the transition from hunting to gathering to farming and the   archaeological methods that have been used to explore this question. The   archaeological evidence for the beginnings of farming in various   regions of the world is then explored in greater detail in order to   understand the specific reasons for the transition from foraging to   farming and the consequences of the adoption of agriculture.    Fieldwork in Archaeology    ANTH-UA 830 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Crabtree, Tryon, White, Wright. Offered in the summer. 4 points.

Human Variation    ANTH-UA 51 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Disotell. 4 points.   Humans are the most wide-ranging of all of the species on earth. Our evolutionary history and our ability to adapt to such a broad range of environments result in the patterns of human variability we see today. New techniques have been developed that allow us to explore the different levels of human variation. Focuses on new data and methodologies, including molecular genetic techniques, and the hypotheses and controversies generated by these new perspectives.    Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior    ANTH-UA 52 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Harrison, Higham, Williams. 4 points.   Introductory survey presenting a synthetic approach to the biological, behavioral, and cultural origins of humans. Explores data and theories from paleoanthropology, archaeology, nonhuman primate behavioral studies, brain research, and sociobiology for their contributions to the study of human behavior.    Human Genetics    ANTH-UA 53 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Disotell. 4 points.   In-depth analysis of the genetic component of human variability. Discusses mechanisms of inheritance, gene expression in individuals and populations, and alternative explanations for genetic variability. Explores the implications of modern advances in genetics, such as genetic engineering and gene therapy.    Primate Behavior and Ecology    ANTH-UA 54 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Higham. 4 points.   Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history. Explores the diversity of primate social systems and the evolutionary relationships among the primates and discusses many of the general ecological laws that have been proposed by evolutionary biologists as the keys to understanding important features of primate behavior and ecology.    Health and Disease in Human Evolution    ANTH-UA 55 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Disotell. 4 points.    Examines human health and disease within an ecological framework, exploring the interactions  of environmental, genetic, physiological, and cultural factors in the expression and distribution of human diseases. Develops pathology profiles for nonhuman primates; prehistoric human populations; and hunting and gathering, agricultural, and industrial groups, with emphasis on the expression of infectious disease in human history and newly (re)emerging diseases.    Comparative Biology of the Living Primates    ANTH-UA 56 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Harrison, Williams. 4 points.   Study of the comparative biology of the primates, our closest living relatives, is fundamental to a sound understanding of human biology and evolution. Surveys the comparative anatomy of the living primates from a structural, functional, and evolutionary perspective. Different anatomical systems and behaviors are explored, including external features, the cranium, dentition and dietary behavior, postcranial anatomy and locomotor behavior, sensory and nervous systems, and reproductive anatomy. The role of comparative anatomy in taxonomy, behavioral studies, and phylogenetic analyses is emphasized. Primate Communication ANTH-UA 57 Identical to ANST-UA 257. Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Offered periodically. 4 points. Increased   social and communicative complexity is one of the defining features of   humans compared to other mammals. Key insights into the evolution of   human communication can come from studying our most closely related   extant relatives, our fellow members of the Primate order. The present   course features a mixture of lectures and discussion classes to consider   contemporary topics in primate (including human) communication. Topics   covered include definitions of communication and consideration of its   major theoretical issues such as the difference between signals and   cues, signal honesty, and concepts of signal information content and   evolutionary signal design. Sections of the class focus on communication   in different sensory modalities\u2014olfactory, auditory, and visual, as   well as multimodal communication\u2014before discussing theories and issues   related to the evolution of language. The class finishes by considering   some of the most contemporary topics in primate communication.    Emerging Diseases    ANTH-UA 80 Disotell, Harrison. 4 points.   Integrates evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, ecology, and behavioral ecology, along with sociocultural anthropology, politics, and economics, to better understand newly emerging and reemerging diseases as they affect human health. General evolutionary theory and an introduction to Darwinian medicine are provided before the course examines viral, bacterial, parasitic, and prion-based diseases along with their hosts, vectors, and other organisms. Particular attention is paid to how humans have purposely and inadvertently created both biological and cultural environments for the transmission of different diseases. Media representations and misrepresentations are examined throughout the course.    Human Ecology    ANTH-UA 90 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Investigates the degree to which variation in human biology and culture can be understood as adaptations to varying external conditions. Examines the relationship of human systems of action and the natural world to understand the various forms of human adaptation. Case studies of several living peoples, contemporary and past biological communities, and prehistoric cultures provide the material for interpretation and evaluation of theoretical positions.    Evolution of Language    ANTH-UA 240 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. 4 points.   Explores the various hypotheses offered for the evolution of language. Perspectives from different disciplines are discussed. Topics include human evolution and the study of fossil humans, animal and primate behavior and communication, anatomy of the vocal tract, neuroanatomy, language acquisition, language universals, the origins and diversification of modern languages, and the origins of writing.    Introduction to Forensic Anthropology    ANTH-UA 326 Ant\u00f3n, Williams. 4 points.   Biological anthropology examines the evolutionary history and adaptability of humans and our ancestors. Forensic anthropology is an applied subfield of biological anthropology that provides expert analysis of the skeleton in a medicolegal setting by utilizing methods developed in skeletal biology, archaeology, and the forensic sciences. Forensic anthropologists play critical roles in identifying victims of mass fatalities (such as the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings), in investigating homicides (such as identifying the Russian tsar's family), and in distinguishing cause of death. The course examines how forensic anthropologists approach modern and historic crimes in the laboratory and the field. Students are introduced to the underlying theory and the applied techniques that forensic anthropologists use to recover and identify individuals and assess cause of death.    Topical Seminar in Biological Anthropology I, II    ANTH-UA 511, 512 Open to majors in anthropology with the permission of the director of undergraduate studies or the instructor.

When the lights come up, the sound editor asks Lee what he thought, and the soft-spoken 53-year-old furrows his brow. Finally, he says, &ldquo;Maybe the music was a little too loud against the dialogue.&rdquo; This tendency to process, to meditate rather than react immediately, is part of what makes the Academy Award-winning director one of film's most eclectic and exacting artists.                  Ironically, it was an early, profound experience with failure that originally set him on the course to filmmaking. Lee's inability to pass Taiwan's college entrance exam&mdash;twice&mdash;steered him to art school in 1972 at age 18. At the National Taiwan University of Arts, he became enamored with music, dance, and theater, and made his first short on Super 8 film. And then one night, while walking in the rain after play rehearsal, he had an epiphany: He realized that he was different than others and had no choice but to devote himself to being an artist. \"It was enlightening,\" Lee explains. \"I felt this chill in my bones. I was lifted.\"     The decision didn't necessarily make life easy. His father was an old-fashioned disciplinarian, principal of one of Taiwan's best high schools, who put no value in artistic ventures. Having fled China with his wife in 1949 after the civil war, he stressed education and the Chinese classics. But when Lee was accepted into the BFA theater program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, his father happily supported him, hoping he'd come to his senses after earning his degree. That didn't happen. Upon graduation, Lee, who found film a more flexible medium than theater because of his limited English, applied to all the top American graduate schools&mdash;only gaining acceptance to NYU.      It's safe to say that those other admissions officers are still kicking themselves. After 10 acclaimed films and 59 international awards&mdash;including two Golden Globes, two BAFTAs, and two Independent Spirit Awards&mdash;Lee is lauded as perhaps the most versatile director from Hollywood to Bollywood. He wrote his first two scripts while working as a stay-at-home dad, eventually sending Pushing Hands (1992) and The Wedding Banquet (1993), both examinations of Chinese cultural and generational divides, to a Taiwanese government writing competition, in which he placed first and second, respectively. This success earned him a chance to direct both films, which were hits in Taiwan and the West. The Wedding Banquet and the subsequent Taiwanese family drama Eat Drink Man Woman (1994) both garnered Oscar nominations for best foreign film, which opened the door to more diverse directing gigs, such as the adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility (1995), the angst-ridden suburban meditation The Ice Storm (1997), and the Civil War tale Ride With the Devil (1999).          &ldquo;Making movies is not about a statement, but raising interesting questions to stir up the [audience&rsquo;s] mind&hellip;. Movies these days,  especially studio movies, they don't  allow people to think. To me, that's a crime.&rdquo;   &mdash;Director Ang Lee               PHOTOS FROM LEFT: DESPITE THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING  BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN , THE TALE OF TWO STAR-CROSSED COWBOYS, PLAYED BY JAKE GYLLENHAAL AND HEATH LEDGER, EARNED LEE HIS FIRST OSCAR FOR DIRECTING. | USING COMPUTER-GENERATED IMAGERY, LEE TRANSFORMED ACTOR ERIC BANA INTO THE NOT-SO-JOLLY GREEN GIANT IN  HULK , THE FIRST BIG-SCREEN ADAPTATION OF THE MARVEL COMIC-BOOK HERO. | THE RITUALS OF FOOD AND LOVE SPICE THE LIFE OF A CONTEMPORARY TAIWANESE FAMILY IN EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN , WHICH LEE CO-WROTE WITH LONGTIME COLLABORATOR JAMES SCHAMUS.                        In Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Lee crafted a sweeping martial arts epic with an art house sensibility. The picture earned 10 Oscar nominations, with four wins, and became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time. His split-screened, emotionally nuanced interpretation of Hulk (2003) also blazed trails in the conventional comic-book film tradition, but it was Brokeback Mountain (2005), a story of forbidden love between two cowboys, that created the biggest stir. Infused with the glory of the most stunning Westerns, Lee staged a tale that had American critics and audiences talking all year. But the film almost didn't happen. Haunted by guilt for his negative depiction of the Hulk's father and frustrated by his uncharacteristically hot temper on the set, he flirted with quitting the business after that movie. Sensing his son's depression and disillusionment, Lee's father actually encouraged him, for the very first time, to get back behind the camera.     While accepting the Academy Award for Best Achievement in Directing for the film, Lee said that Brokeback was about \"not just all the gay men and women whose love is denied by society, but just as important, the greatness of love itself.\" He also made a special dedication to his father, who died just as the movie began production: \"More than any other, I made this film for him.\"     NYU Alumni Magazine recently spoke to Lee at Sound One Studios in New York while he put the finishing touches on Lust, Caution , which recently took the top prize at the Venice Film Festival and opened in theaters in September.                Your English was quite limited when you started film school, but people took notice of you right away. Fellow student Spike Lee even used you as  an assistant director on his thesis project. How did you manage to  attract everyone's attention?   I'm normally a quiet person but when I direct, people tend to listen to me. You know, it's like gang members. It doesn't matter if someone is big or small. If you tell people what to do, and those people survive, they tend to listen to you. Same thing. After school I was doing little jobs for a Chinese TV crew. I would start out in the morning as the lighting person, and by the afternoon, the director would be listening to me [ laughs ].     What did you say that made these people listen?  I don't know. Up to directing Sense and Sensibility , I could hardly finish a fluent sentence in English. And this was Jane Austen, with a top-of-the-line English cast and crew. How did I do that? It's hard to explain. But that gave me faith in moviemaking, that it's a universal experience. It can penetrate cultural barriers, language barriers. There's something universal about sight and sound. It made me feel anything was doable. And like I belonged.     So how did things change after making Sense and Sensibility ?  After that, in terms of filmmaking, I was pretty well-grounded. I could face my father and say, 'I have a job.' I could sound like I knew what I was doing. But then I had to make The Ice Storm . I had to break that. It's like the Taoist saying: 'You have to change.' If you don't change, you're dead, you get stiff. That's a sign of decline and a big fear for me. I had fans who liked my movies, but you sort of have to break that contract with them. You have to remind yourself that making movies is about looking for freedom. It's risky, it's scary. Somebody will say, 'I loved Sense and Sensibility ,' and then you pitch them The Ice Storm and they're like, 'What are you doing to me?' But if I don't do that, if I make Sense and Sensibility , and then [director John Madden's] Shakespeare in Love next, I feel it gets stiff.

How much does Taoism influence the films you choose to make?  Being Chinese, I just naturally grapple with Taoist thoughts and self-doubt because there's always something three feet above your head&mdash;there's something watching, something bigger than you. So you're never sure about yourself because you're the little human, and what are we compared to the big natural laws? People think Taoism is pessimistic, that you just follow whatever, flow with the wave and do nothing. But nature takes its own course. You live, you die. You know, it never puts humanity first. Humanity is about how we fit in; it's not about conquering.         You're known as a great but gentle leader on sets. Did your father, who was a high school principal, have an affect on how you manage others?  Starting with Hulk , when I would lose my patience, I [realized I] could have a big temper like my father [ laughs ]. He was a very stately man, very decisive. I didn't like how he would treat my mother sometimes. He was tough, very traditional. My wife, she dominates me [ laughs ]. She makes the rules, and she's smart and very independent. But somehow, like during Hulk , you realize the family genes are so strong. You've got the same physical problems; you get the same temper. You know there's no escape, and now I have to repress that a little bit.    You don't want to just go barking at people to make them afraid of you. That's not me. You make people listen to you by reasoning. I think it takes greater confidence in yourself to tell people, 'Give me a moment' or 'I changed my mind' or 'I don't know what I'm gonna do yet. Wait a little bit and let me just sort it out.'      You were a huge admirer of the late Ingmar Bergman. How did watching his film The Virgin Spring change your life, as you've said?  That film put the doubt of God in me. I was 18 when I saw it, and it's brutal. It took away my innocence, so to speak. I can't make a Bergman movie, but I realized then that movies could have that spirit in them. And just last summer [2006] I got to meet him. It was like a pilgrimage. He gave me a hug, and his hug was so motherly. It was very soft.&hellip; Thirty-five years ago this man took away my innocence, and now he's giving me a very motherly hug. It was like&hellip;life is okay.      You met him as a fan, but he was probably a fan of yours, too.  He loved quite a few of my movies, so that was&hellip;I don't know how to describe it. It was beyond nice.      Is there something you're trying to give to your audience, just like Bergman gave to you? Are you trying to make them leave the theater with a certain feeling?  With doubt. I think it's embodied in me, and each movie. Making movies is not about a statement, but raising interesting questions to stir up the [audience's] mind. I think that's what movies should do. Movies these days, especially studio movies, they don't allow people to think. To me, that's a crime.      So you usually look for thought-provoking scripts?  Most scripts are built like battleships, unsinkable. They're for producers, for investors. They give you a lot of security, like, 'How can we go wrong with this? How big a schmuck can you be if you fuck that up?' [ laughs ] Most scripts I get are like that. You can go to war with them, but that's not for me. They're not interesting. They should be simple, but a lot of writers, they don't do that. That's why I work with James Schamus a lot, because his [scripts] are underwritten.     You're known as a shy person in social situations and have called filmmaking an escape. What are you hiding from?  Well, I'm just good at filmmaking. I'm not very good at, you know, being social [ laughs ] or a lot of other things. So, just naturally, if I'm making a film, it's positive reinforcement, and other things can be a negative reinforcement. I'm a daydreamer. I think a lot of creative people are like that. I don't know why I'm shy at parties. Maybe because I don't have enough knowledge to carry on an interesting conversation&mdash;unless it's related to filmmaking [ laughs ].      I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with that.  I don't know. But when it relates to filmmaking, I get crazy. I get really fanatic about [film] research, and then I sound smart. That's a pleasure for me. I like making movies, and the rest of my life is rather boring. It's true.     You're a uniquely international filmmaker. What do you do that makes your stories appeal to such broad audiences?  Whatever it takes to make a movie interesting, I'll do it. [For Lust, Caution ] I have a French composer, a Mexican cinematographer, whatever works. And if the script doesn't go well, then James [Schamus], the American, will help out through translation. If you just make a film for a Chinese audience, you don't have to worry about who doesn't know the background. But if you think it's going out to the world, you have to think twice about it, you have to make adjustments. That I do.      But it seems like you tap into something else that resonates across all audiences, a sense of longing or searching.  Maybe it's because I drift around. My parents drifted from China to Taiwan, and then I came to the States, and now I go back to China, where things are changing. Taiwan's also changed. Things are constantly changed.   I was always on a losing side. It's easy for me to identify with losers because I've always had to adapt, I've always had to blend, and that's just my life. It's not like I'm American or Japanese or German, where you have very strong defining roots. I don't. My root is the tradition of Chinese culture, which [as a child] I never saw, I was only told.      Is it this theme of being on the losing side that's most relatable for people?  There is something universal about that. I think through movies we try to discover truths about life. We use different materials, different channels to think about essential questions, deeper questions. This search for truth should be universal.    There's another thing that's universal about the film world today, which is different from when I was a student. There's more film consistency now; there's a crust of universality among the global art house lines. There's a certain standard taste you have to meet that is not a whole lot different from Japan to Brazil to China.     What do you think caused that?  Well, we all learn from the same things. There's a global village, the information flows so fast now. The taste is less local I think at the film festival level, at the art house level.      After fleeing China, your parents were never secure, even once they prospered in Taiwan. In the fickle world of entertainment, do you still get the feeling that at any moment your success could come to a halt?  I've had a lot of goodwill, so I'm quite satisfied. Whatever happens, I'm just trying not to mess it up. I cherish it. But sometimes, when it comes to the Academy, I cannot say I don't really care [about success] because when you make a movie, you lead many people. Everybody comes in with a dream, and I feel responsible to make everybody happy. So I still go as far as I can.     How has being Taiwan-born affected your experience in Hollywood?  I thought, being Chinese, I had to be twice as good to get half as much. I just told myself that's probably what it's gonna be. It turns out it's not as hard [to be a Chinese director]. In some ways I feel lucky because I got help from the Taiwanese government&mdash;and my classmates from America, they didn't get help from the American government [ laughs ].      Alienation and regret are central themes in the lives of your characters. What do you want people to learn from this?  They have to deal with it. They have to face it. I think that's what [my] films suggest, because nothing is reliable, nothing stands still. My movies are all about certain systems, certain beliefs, certain relationships&mdash;the things that people try to hang on to, especially. They get disappointed in the end. It's like Brokeback [ Mountain ]; you never really get back to it, you just try.     Do you consciously try to put those sentiments into your stories?  They're just my feelings about life. I think the phrase that puts it best was by Jane Austen in Sense and Sensibility : It's personal free will versus social obligations. You have to fulfill obligations to be grounded, to relate to people, to live with other people, to feel their company so you're not lonely. But at the same time, you want to break from it because that's not freedom. In all my films, at the end of the day, it's like religion: You always look for  the answer, for the ultimate freedom. What is the ultimate freedom? For me, it's making movies. With art, we try to break free, but there's no such thing [ laughs ]. Unless you choose to die, there's no freedom.     You've said that you hope to live to 300, so you can keep making movies.  Are there any particular stories you're anxious to tell?  I don't have a checklist. I like making movies, and I think I have a good appetite for it. I just want to keep learning.

Race, \"Difference,\" and Social Inequality      ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Khan. 4 points.   Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.

Bilingual students are encouraged to focus on cases that use interpreters.    Gender, Violence, and the Law    ANTH-UA 330 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Examines the global prevalence of gender violence and the varied meanings of violence against women and changes in terminology over time. Examines ways of theorizing gender and violence, including performative ideas of gender. The creation of gender violence as a social problem is a product of social movements in the United States, Europe, India, and many other parts of the world.

Human Rights and Culture    ANTH-UA 331 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous peoples' rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life.

Also examines how this changes the ways people earn their livelihoods; how cultures are transmitted and hybridized; how migrating populations maintain connections to their homelands; how group identities are constructed and asserted; and how social movements around newly politicized issues arise. Discusses changing roles of nation-states and the growing significance of transnational, diasporic, and globalized social relations and cultural forms.    Culture Through Food    ANTH-UA 410 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers. 4 points.   Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.      Roma in East Central Europe   ANTH-UA 9200 Offered at NYU Prague. 4 points.   Introduces students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority to the emergence of Romany organizations, with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. Emphasizes the three themes of identity, power, and history, and challenges monocausal and ahistorical explanations for the social situation of Roma. Builds on a diverse selection of empirical material and evidence: ethnographic, historical, artistic, and sociological.

Archaeological Theory and Technique    ANTH-UA 215 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree, Tryon, White, Wright. 4 points.   Considers both current and past theoretical developments in archaeology, with special attention to the role of innovations in analytical technique as they relate to these developments. Theoretical approaches to the economy, technology, and organization of hunter-gatherers; early agriculturalists; gender differences; and complex societies. Examines research design, sampling problems, chronometric methods, analysis of paleoenvironments, and typology in terms of modern understanding as well as historical perspective.    Surveys of Regional Prehistory I: Egypt and the Near East    ANTH-UA 216 001 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. Wright. 4 points.   Introduces the archaeology of the Near East and Egypt. Examines the archaeological evidence for two major transformations: the origins of food production (the domestication of plants and animals) and the development of cities and states. Focuses primarily on the Tigris and Euphrates and Nile Valleys, but other contiguous regions also are considered. Emphasizes the cultural history of the two regions and how these changes influenced the development of increasingly complex social organization and our present understanding of urbanism and state-level societies.    Surveys of Regional Prehistory II: Prehistoric Europe to the End of the Ice Age    ANTH-UA 216 002 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. White. 4 points.   Prehistories of selected culture areas. Emphasizes the theoretical and methodological foundations of archaeology within a culture area as reconstructed through archaeological methods. The choice of region varies with the interests of individual instructors.    Barbarian Europe    ANTH-UA 217 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.    African Archaeology    ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). Tryon. 4 points.   With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the experiences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situating the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food production, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent.    Discovering Archaeology in New York City    ANTH-UA 225 Wright. 4 points.   In this course, New York City is our archaeological site. The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage. Last Hunters-First Farmers ANTH-UA 608 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or instructor permission. Offered every two years. 4 points. Last   Hunters-First Farmers explores the transition from foraging to   agriculture throughout the Eastern Hemisphere and the Americas. The   course begins with a review of the theories that have been proposed to   explain the transition from hunting to gathering to farming and the   archaeological methods that have been used to explore this question. The   archaeological evidence for the beginnings of farming in various   regions of the world is then explored in greater detail in order to   understand the specific reasons for the transition from foraging to   farming and the consequences of the adoption of agriculture.    Fieldwork in Archaeology    ANTH-UA 830 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Crabtree, Tryon, White, Wright. Offered in the summer. 4 points.

Human Variation    ANTH-UA 51 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Disotell. 4 points.   Humans are the most wide-ranging of all of the species on earth. Our evolutionary history and our ability to adapt to such a broad range of environments result in the patterns of human variability we see today. New techniques have been developed that allow us to explore the different levels of human variation. Focuses on new data and methodologies, including molecular genetic techniques, and the hypotheses and controversies generated by these new perspectives.    Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior    ANTH-UA 52 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Harrison, Higham, Williams. 4 points.   Introductory survey presenting a synthetic approach to the biological, behavioral, and cultural origins of humans. Explores data and theories from paleoanthropology, archaeology, nonhuman primate behavioral studies, brain research, and sociobiology for their contributions to the study of human behavior.    Human Genetics    ANTH-UA 53 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Disotell. 4 points.   In-depth analysis of the genetic component of human variability. Discusses mechanisms of inheritance, gene expression in individuals and populations, and alternative explanations for genetic variability. Explores the implications of modern advances in genetics, such as genetic engineering and gene therapy.    Primate Behavior and Ecology    ANTH-UA 54 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Higham. 4 points.   Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history. Explores the diversity of primate social systems and the evolutionary relationships among the primates and discusses many of the general ecological laws that have been proposed by evolutionary biologists as the keys to understanding important features of primate behavior and ecology.    Health and Disease in Human Evolution    ANTH-UA 55 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Disotell. 4 points.    Examines human health and disease within an ecological framework, exploring the interactions  of environmental, genetic, physiological, and cultural factors in the expression and distribution of human diseases. Develops pathology profiles for nonhuman primates; prehistoric human populations; and hunting and gathering, agricultural, and industrial groups, with emphasis on the expression of infectious disease in human history and newly (re)emerging diseases.    Comparative Biology of the Living Primates    ANTH-UA 56 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Harrison, Williams. 4 points.   Study of the comparative biology of the primates, our closest living relatives, is fundamental to a sound understanding of human biology and evolution. Surveys the comparative anatomy of the living primates from a structural, functional, and evolutionary perspective. Different anatomical systems and behaviors are explored, including external features, the cranium, dentition and dietary behavior, postcranial anatomy and locomotor behavior, sensory and nervous systems, and reproductive anatomy. The role of comparative anatomy in taxonomy, behavioral studies, and phylogenetic analyses is emphasized. Primate Communication ANTH-UA 57 Identical to ANST-UA 257. Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Offered periodically. 4 points. Increased   social and communicative complexity is one of the defining features of   humans compared to other mammals. Key insights into the evolution of   human communication can come from studying our most closely related   extant relatives, our fellow members of the Primate order. The present   course features a mixture of lectures and discussion classes to consider   contemporary topics in primate (including human) communication. Topics   covered include definitions of communication and consideration of its   major theoretical issues such as the difference between signals and   cues, signal honesty, and concepts of signal information content and   evolutionary signal design. Sections of the class focus on communication   in different sensory modalities\u2014olfactory, auditory, and visual, as   well as multimodal communication\u2014before discussing theories and issues   related to the evolution of language. The class finishes by considering   some of the most contemporary topics in primate communication.    Emerging Diseases    ANTH-UA 80 Disotell, Harrison. 4 points.   Integrates evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, ecology, and behavioral ecology, along with sociocultural anthropology, politics, and economics, to better understand newly emerging and reemerging diseases as they affect human health. General evolutionary theory and an introduction to Darwinian medicine are provided before the course examines viral, bacterial, parasitic, and prion-based diseases along with their hosts, vectors, and other organisms. Particular attention is paid to how humans have purposely and inadvertently created both biological and cultural environments for the transmission of different diseases. Media representations and misrepresentations are examined throughout the course.    Human Ecology    ANTH-UA 90 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Investigates the degree to which variation in human biology and culture can be understood as adaptations to varying external conditions. Examines the relationship of human systems of action and the natural world to understand the various forms of human adaptation. Case studies of several living peoples, contemporary and past biological communities, and prehistoric cultures provide the material for interpretation and evaluation of theoretical positions.    Evolution of Language    ANTH-UA 240 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. 4 points.   Explores the various hypotheses offered for the evolution of language. Perspectives from different disciplines are discussed. Topics include human evolution and the study of fossil humans, animal and primate behavior and communication, anatomy of the vocal tract, neuroanatomy, language acquisition, language universals, the origins and diversification of modern languages, and the origins of writing.    Introduction to Forensic Anthropology    ANTH-UA 326 Ant\u00f3n, Williams. 4 points.   Biological anthropology examines the evolutionary history and adaptability of humans and our ancestors. Forensic anthropology is an applied subfield of biological anthropology that provides expert analysis of the skeleton in a medicolegal setting by utilizing methods developed in skeletal biology, archaeology, and the forensic sciences. Forensic anthropologists play critical roles in identifying victims of mass fatalities (such as the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings), in investigating homicides (such as identifying the Russian tsar's family), and in distinguishing cause of death. The course examines how forensic anthropologists approach modern and historic crimes in the laboratory and the field. Students are introduced to the underlying theory and the applied techniques that forensic anthropologists use to recover and identify individuals and assess cause of death.

These lines not only introduce but also summarize the Taoist perspective of the universe and its system of values. It is important to understand the Chinese character Tao (\u9053) because it is one of the most important terms in Taoism. Tao can be translated as the noun form of &ldquo;path,&rdquo; &ldquo;principle,&rdquo; or the verb form of &ldquo;to speak&rdquo; depending on one&rsquo;s interpretation. The translation of the two opening lines of the Tao Te Ching varies by interpreter because of the lack of punctuation throughout the verses. However, people generally understand it as, &ldquo;The &lsquo;principle&rsquo; that can be &lsquo;spoken&rsquo; is not the eternal &lsquo;way&rsquo; and the &lsquo;name&rsquo; that can be &lsquo;named&rsquo; is not the eternal &lsquo;name&rsquo;&rdquo; because it aligns with the other main concepts in Taoism (\u4f59\u79cb\u96e8, 2009). Essentially, the meaning of the phrase is that the world did not come into being with pre-existing principles for humans to follow to create meaning. Humans must understand and explain the world by making their own observations and interpreting their own experiences.    Because of this principle, Taoists also believe in the concepts of \u300c\u7269\u6975\u5fc5\u53cd\u300d(pinyin: wu-ji-bi-fan; literal meaning: things always reverse upon reaching an extreme) and \u300c\u7121\u70ba\u300d(pinyin: wu-wei; literal meaning: non action). According to Yip (2005), wu-wei is a combined concept of both &ldquo;passive progressivity&rdquo; and &ldquo;harmony with nature,&rdquo; that humans accept life&rsquo;s natural order without intervening (p. 5). This concept is similar to the idea of \u300c\u9806\u6d41\u300d(pinyin: shun-liu; literal meaning: going along with the flow like water) in that humans must accept that their lives change and shift depending on their environment (Slingerland, 2003; Young, Zhang, Xiao, Zhou, &amp; Zhu, 2002). As the I Ching, a classical Chinese text from circa 800 BCE (Hacker, 1993), suggests\u300c\u9670\u967d\u300d(pinyin: yin-yang; literal meaning: dark bright) is the force that provides persistent adjustment within balance between opposing forces. In other words, yin and yang keep the world functioning in its natural order because of the contrary but interdependent relationship between the two concepts. The State of Mental Health Care in Mainland China The Taoist system of values has been facilitating a solution to mental suffering since Ancient China (Cheng, Lo, &amp; Chio, 2010). However, since Ancient Chinese philosophers never intended to study mind-body problems through empirical analysis, psychology in China has been viewed as a discipline that started in the West (Blowers, 2000). Compared to many other countries, China is far behind in terms of mental health development (Deutsch-Chinesische Akademie Fur Psychotherapie), partially because of the Great Proletariat Cultural Revolution set into motion by Mao Zedong in 1966 after his failed Great Leap Forward (Yang, 1998). The revolution has created the period of greatest political instability in the five millennia of Chinese history (Yang, 1998), bringing China to a &ldquo;tempo unprecedented in history&rdquo; in terms of development (Teng, 1971). The demand for clinical services increased dramatically after the multiple natural and man-made tragedies that happened within China in the past three decades (Xu &amp; Wu, 2011). In fact, there are only about 16,000 psychiatrists (Liu et al., 2011) for its estimated 16 million people in need of mental health care in Mainland China (Kleinberg &amp; Thomas, 2012).    Because modern empirical psychology was first developed in the West, the influence of Euro-American-based psychology has become the mainstream psychology across the world (Jing, 2000). Euro-American psychology has dominated other forms of psychology due to the massive exportation of its publications worldwide (Sexton &amp; Hogan, 1992). The increasing number of adolescents educated outside of their own countries has also dramatically enhanced the transfer of Euro-American knowledge to regions beyond the borders of its origins (Blowers, 2010; Danziger, 2006). However, as Chinese sociologists Yang and Gao (1991) point out, Chinese culture (i.e. social structure and self) is almost the exact opposite of Western culture, and therefore, core values, standards of abnormality and treatments vary. In terms of therapy, for example, Chinese students perceive the counselor&rsquo;s role more as one of an expert (61.8%) compared to a listener (31.4%), in contrast to American students&rsquo; view of counselors as listeners first (77%) and experts second (50.7%) (Mau &amp; Jepsen, 1988). Hence, native Chinese mental health professionals are working to develop indigenous psychology in order to avoid the potential incompatibility of Euro-American psychological theories with the cultures to which these theories are exported (Jing, 2000). This paper will investigate Chinese Taoist Cognitive Psychotherapy as a culturally specific psychotherapy that may be more appropriate than Western forms of therapy within Chinese populations because of its basis in Taoist principles and Chinese language. Importance of Language Within Culture Understanding the Chinese cultural context is essential to interpreting Chinese Taoist Cognitive Psychotherapy. Cultural context is what makes one ethnic group different from another (Bond, 2010). Culture is comprised of many dynamics, including language for communication and tradition to express its characteristics (Bond, 2010). Culture and language are inseparable as they cannot exist and grow without each other (Brown 1994; Jiang, 2000). Although people may express the same idea differently, this does not necessarily mean that they have different ways of processing the same information (Boroditsky, 2010). Recently, cognitive scientists have begun to suggest that language can help construct human understanding of the essential but abstract ideas such as causality, space and time (Boroditsky, 2010). People build more complicated and abstract concepts, such as morality and beliefs (Boroditsky, 2010), upon the language that they are comfortable using and pass these concepts down through generations. Since language is a tool created by humanity (Piaget, 1962) to build and spread culture, it can be concluded that language is one of the most important factors that determine and define culture (Brown 1994; Jiang, 2000).    Because of the complex interplay of culture and language, it is critical to understand how cultural context informs meaning in language as well. The mistranslation of &ldquo;mokusatsu&rdquo; during World War II, for example, is one of the most infamous mistranslations in history, serving as a reminder of the serious consequences a mistranslation can lead to. &ldquo;Mokusatsu&rdquo; is a Japanese word that is composed of two kanji, \u9ed8(r\u014dmaji: moku, literal meaning: silence) and \u6bba (r\u014dmaji: satsu, literal meaning: killing). It is an ambiguous term that means both &ldquo;maintaining silence &ndash; no comment&rdquo; and &ldquo;treating it with contempt &ndash; not worthy to comment&rdquo; (National Security Agency, 1968). The &ldquo;ill-chosen translation&rdquo; of the Japanese word &ldquo;mokusatsu&rdquo; served as a catalyst for the U.S. dropping two nuclear bombs in Japan (National Security Agency, 1968). Because an international news agency translated the word as &ldquo;not worthy to comment,&rdquo; the U.S. government assumed that the Japanese government was ignoring the terms of surrender, treating them with contempt (National Security Agency, 1968). The tragic linguistic error of &ldquo;mokusatsu&rdquo; reminds us that it is impossible to have exact translation counterparts in every other language. People sometimes use words that can only be understood accurately with appropriate contextual clues and cultural background despite seemingly paradoxical definitions (i.e. pretty and pretty ugly). People with diverse cultural backgrounds have their viewpoints influenced by their languages differently (National Security Agency, 1968).    The importance of understanding cultural context can also be shown in the comparison of the word for dog in Chinese and English. Most English-speaking people will associate the word &ldquo;dog&rdquo; with concepts like loyalty and &ldquo;man&rsquo;s best friend&rdquo; (Jiang, 2000, p. 329). However, Chinese language has a rather negative connotation for the word \u72d7 (pinyin: gou; literal meaning: dog) (Jiang, 2000), especially in use of idioms such as \u72fc\u5fc3\u72d7\u80ba (pinyin: l&aacute;ng-x\u012bn-g\u01d2u-f&egrave;i; literal meaning: brutal and cold-blooded) and \u8c6c\u670b\u72d7\u53cb (pinyin: zh\u016b-p&eacute;ng-g\u01d2u-y\u01d2u; literal meaning: fair-weather friend). Although the word refers to the same animal, there is an apparent distinction between the ideas that each language expresses.    Studies suggest that the quality of many Western tests and assessments that are translated into other languages may be lacking (Cheung, Leong, &amp; Ben-Porath, 2003). For example, cognitive assessment, with a heavy focus on verbal evaluation and understanding sentence structure, may have a questionable validity because of the linguistic difficulty of maintaining the meanings of all terms within the translation (Chan, Shum, &amp; Cheung, 2003). As suggested in Jiang&rsquo;s (2010) study, translated word may not always be the culturally appropriate word for the participant to stimulate an expected association. In this sense, it is fairly easy to explain the increasing demand of developing a form of psychotherapy for Chinese people that matches their language, beliefs, tradition and cultures. The Cultural Coherence of Chinese Taoist Cognitive Psychotherapy Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one the most thoroughly studied Euro-American therapies used by mental health professionals. The therapy has been used internationally because of its fundamental belief that &ldquo;you are what you think you are,&rdquo; which is derived from basic behavioral and cognitive principles (Dobson, 2012). It encourages members that are participating in the CBT session to develop and maintain a positive perspective regarding their experiences by increasing coping skills such as minimizing, reappraising and restructuring distressing thoughts (Hamblen, 2010) and changing maladaptive behavior (Klein, Bernard &amp; Singer, 1992).    Previous literature suggests that Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), a derivation of CBT, is one of the most prominent theoretical approaches in Asian counties, including China (Hodges &amp; Oei, 2007). Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapies are virtually non-existent (Cheng, 1993), whereas REBT, a comprehensive, active-directive and empirically-based psychotherapy, is fairly common. The framework of REBT matches the traditional Chinese values that seek a direct and solution-focused approach (Hodges &amp; Oei, 2007) from a rational and authoritative expert (Chen &amp; Devenport, 2005; Mau &amp; Jepsen, 1988), rather than self-exploration (Cheng, 1993). In fact, Albert Ellis, the creator of this relatively new psychotherapy, advocated helping clients to change their irrational beliefs in order to alter their subsequent emotional consequences (Albert Ellis Institute). Although it is uncertain whether REBT is more effective in a particular population for a specific reason, literature emphasizes the increasing concern of the importance of language (Kung, 2004) by developing and modifying indigenous psychotherapies (Cheng, Cheung, &amp; Chen, 1993; Zhang et al., 2002). As more and more educated Chinese mental health professionals grow aware of the differences in measurements of mental diagnosis (i.e. ICD-10, CCMD-3 and DSM-IV-TR) and social norms, there have been rising doubts as to whether Western-based treatments are suitable for Chinese people in the Chinese cultural context.    Taoist beliefs have been embedded in Chinese culture for centuries. Previous literature suggests that cultural factors are a critical element of individual mental health. (Tseng, Kitanishi, Maeshiro, &amp; Zhu, 2012) Because Chinese medical anthropologists have discovered that perception of an illness&rsquo; etiology and symptoms varies between people with different cultural beliefs (Ji, Lee, &amp; Guo, 2010), indigenous psychotherapy might be a more beneficial form of treatment in China. Two psychiatrists, Dersen Young and Yalin Zhang, studied Taoist attitudes of mental health principles and developed Chinese Taoist Cognitive Psychotherapy (CTCP) as a modification of REBT in 1992. Chinese Taoist Cognitive Psychotherapy (CTCP) is an instructive treatment based on eight Taoist principles. During the course of treatment, Chinese patients ask the therapist for explanations and guidelines as opposed to engaging in behaviors such as self-exploration (Zhang et al., 2002), which may be more suitable in independent cultures like that of the United States and Western Europe.    The eight core Taoist principles of CTCP are comprised of 32 Chinese characters from Tao Te Ching and used in clinical application: 1) \u5229\u800c\u4e0d\u5bb3 (literal meaning: Benefit without harm to yourself and others); 2) \u70ba\u800c\u4e0d\u722d (literal meaning: Do your best without competition with others); 3) \u5c11\u79c1\u5be1\u617e (literal meaning: Limit selfishness and moderate desire); 4) \u77e5\u8db3\u77e5\u6b62 (literal meaning: Know when to stop and learn how to be satisfied); 5) \u77e5\u548c\u8655\u4e0b (literal meaning: Know harmony and be humble); 6) \u4ee5\u67d4\u5236\u525b (literal meaning: Hold softness to defeat hardness); 7) \u8fd4\u6a38\u6b78\u771f (literal meaning: Return to purity and innocence) and 8) \u9806\u5176\u81ea\u7136 (literal meaning: Follow the rule of nature) (Young et al., 2002). They applied these core principles to the ABC framework of REBT (i.e. identify the nature of the Adversity event, distinguish the irrational Beliefs from rational beliefs, and understand the Consequences of the irrational beliefs) to create its own ABCDE model: Assessment of Stress (i.e. Find actual stress factors), Belief System (i.e. Understand belief system), Conflict and coping system (i.e. Analyze conflict and coping styles), Doctrine direction (i.e. Imbue doctrine of Taoism), and Evaluate effect (Feng, Cao, Zhang, Wee, &amp; Kua, 2011). The therapeutic model of CTCP, unlike REBT, incorporates Chinese Taoist philosophies into the treatment (Liu, &amp; Leung, 2010). The main rationale behind the addition of Taoist philosophies is to regulate patients&rsquo; negative effect, correct maladaptive behavior, and treat psychological problems by utilizing Taoist values (Feng et al., 2011). CTCP emphasizes psychological, affective health and spiritual freedom along with Taoist concepts like detachment from excessive desires and compliance with the course of nature (Young, Tseng, &amp; Zhou, 2005).    CTCP is a leading psychotherapy that has become widely acceptable and studied in China since 1995 (Mao, &amp; Zhao, 2011). Literature suggests that, because of Taoism&rsquo;s heavy emphasis on natural order without human interference, Taoist values are particularly helpful to patients with an anxiety disorder, depression (\u674e\u6885\u679d, &amp; \u59dc\u51ac\u4e45, 2011), or to patients who have immediate family members with neurotic personality disorders (\u674e\u6885\u679d et al., 2008). Zhu, Yang, Xiao, and Liu (2005) also reported that CTCP has significantly reduced Type A personalities and anxious-depressive behaviors in patients with coronary heart disease. However, since CTCP strongly highlights the idea of detachment, it might not be an appropriate treatment for adolescents or young adults as it might lower motivation (\u674e\u6885\u679d et al., 2008). For that reason, older clients with internal emotional struggles may benefit the most from this psychotherapy. Chinese people that are influenced by Chinese culture are prone to accept a more didactic form of psychotherapy because they tend to value hierarchical organization (Zhang et al., 2002) that prompts the respectfulness and compliance of authority dependence (Hsu, 1970). Therefore, they are more likely to benefit from following practitioners&rsquo; instructions and encouragements and from coping with mental health issues through Taoist values (\u66f9\u9cf4\u5c90, 2004).  Future Directions Young and Zhang, two indigenous mental health professionals that are experts in the language and culture of their target population, developed CTCP partially in an attempt to address concerns that Western therapies were not suitable for the Chinese cultural context. The therapy&rsquo;s directive approach of actively persuading patients to detach is an essential Taoist element that successfully tailors this psychotherapy to native Chinese people (Ji, 1994). Both practitioners and the target population benefit from this indigenous psychotherapy because most language or cultural barrier issues are minimized due to the mutual understanding of and familiarity with the language and culture. There are, however, some important issues to consider with regard to CTCP. A significant number of Chinese reports are limited to solely Chinese society because research reports generally have to be written in English for reception in the international community (Blowers, 2010; Cheung, Leong, &amp; Ben-Porath, 2003). Future studies should take this into account in order to expand accessibility to the public. Additionally, it is uncertain whether CTCP is compatible with Chinese people that are heavily exposed to other cultures (Ward, &amp; Lin, 2010). Chinese Americans, for example, might be experiencing a different cultural context with a complicated cultural identity and possible acculturation stress in addition to existing symptoms. Since there is a lack of literature explaining the low percentage of those seeking help from a mental health treatment provider (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001) or the high dropout rate of mental health treatment within the Chinese population in the United States (Wang &amp; Kim, 2010), it is difficult to identify if differing cultural values or treatment incompatibility explain this underutilization. Studies have shown that in Chinese society, there is an intense stigma surrounding mental illness, and for those who require treatment, concern about shame or loss of face is common and demotivating (Kung, 2004). Previous research suggests that there is a comparably high utilization of CBT and psychodynamic psychotherapy within the Chinese population in the United States that identify as more &ldquo;Americanized&rdquo; (Kim, Atkinson, &amp; Yang, 1999). However, it is uncertain whether the lower level of Chinese cultural stigma regarding mental illness or the higher level of familiarity of the English language and culture increases the likelihood of attending psychotherapy sessions for people that identify as more &ldquo;Americanized&rdquo;. It is therefore important to consider how strongly the patient identifies with his or her Chinese cultural heritage. Because of the development of Chinese psychology in both academic and clinical research, extra in-depth research on the effectiveness of CTCP in different populations must be done before further conclusions can be drawn.
