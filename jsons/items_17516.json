Overview         Computing professionals have to learn new programming    languages all the time. This course teaches the fundamental    principles of programming languages that enable you to learn    new languages quickly and help you decide which one is best    suited for a given task.         We will explore new ways of viewing computation and programs, and new    ways of approaching algorithmic problems, making you better    programmers overall. The topics covered in this course include    recursion and induction, algebraic data types and pattern matching,    higher-order functions, continuations and tail recursion, programming    language syntax and semantics, type systems, and objects and    classes. We will explore this material by building interpreters for    programming languages of increasing complexity. The course will thus    be accompanied by extensive programming projects. We will use the    programming language Scala for these projects, which you will also    learn in this course.      Prerequisites: Computer Systems   Organization (CSCI-UA 201). Proficiency in programming   languages such as Java is expected.     Course Material      Required Reading          Essentials of Programming Languages, Third Edition by   Daniel P.
