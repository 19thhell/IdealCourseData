Public readings are performed each weekend with a discussion following each Sunday matinee. Our work honors the history of the Provincetown Playhouse where the early plays of Eugene O&rsquo;Neill, Susan Glaspell, and Edna St. Vincent Millay were first presented. However, this series changes focus by devoting its efforts to development of new works for children, youth and family audiences written by both NYU students and noted authors in New York City, the US, and abroad. Keeping with the goals of the Program in Educational Theatre, our series offers both students and theatre professionals the opportunity to test new ideas and methods within the field of TYA (Theatre for Young Audiences).    In conjunction with the series, the Program in Educational Theatre runs a graduate course, Theatre Practices : Problems in Play Production, the Development of New Plays, which studies theories and methods of play development utilizing the series as a laboratory. Students in the class both observe rehearsals and interact with the playwrights, directors, and dramaturgs over the course of the series.    2015 Season    New Plays for Young Audiences will present rehearsed readings of three new plays for young audiences June 6 &ndash; 21 at the Provincetown Playhouse. An audience discussion with the playwright and director will follow the Sunday readings. All tickets are free.    Mario and the Comet that Stopped the World Book and Lyrics by Gabriel Jason Dean, Music by David Dabbon. The Venedicci Comet is headed straight toward Earth. Apocalyptics predict that it will strike, causing total annihilation; while most scientists speculate it will be a near-miss and Earthlings will behold history&rsquo;s most awe-inspiring celestial event. Either way, Mario is prepared. With a chorus of rubber ducks and soaring songs about the theory of relativity, Mario and the Comet that Stopped the World is a musical adventure-comedy about how loss can be like an earth-shattering comet; but when faced together as a family, it can become a thing of beauty&mdash; a celebration of life and love. Readings are on Saturday, June 6, TBD, and Sunday, June 7, at 3:00 p.m. Courtney Sale directs. For ages 8 and up.    Gabriel Jason Dean &rsquo;s plays have been produced or developed at New York Theatre Workshop, McCarter, The Flea, Oregon Shakespeare, Kennedy Center, Dallas Children&rsquo;s Theatre, and others.

Students study the history and criticism of TYA and take internships with companies such as the New Victory Theatre on 42 nd Street. Playwriting courses are offered where students learn the craft of scripting TYA texts and workshop these in our experimental Black Box studio.    A storytelling season is offered annually where New York&rsquo;s finest artists perform for family audiences in the legendary, and newly renovated, Provincetown Playhouse . Students can study storytelling and learn the artistry which powers it.    A traveling troupe of student players, Shakespeare to Go , take clever cuts of the Bard around the New York City schools. Recent productions have included A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream and Romeo and Juliet . Students take class in Shakespearean education, and collaborate with a youth ensemble dedicated to this effort. In the summer, our Looking for Shakespeare project brings young people from across the country who create their own adaptation of a classic play. In the process students study dramaturgy, playmaking, and theatre design.    Theatrix! the student run club offers the chance to experiment in TYA in a range of artistic modalities, from performer to producer. A play development series is offered each summer which bring to campus national and international playwrights who workshop original material with Educational Theatre students. Guest artists have included Jose Cruz Gonzalez, Louis Lowry, Diane Samuels, and Susan Zeder. Partnerships have been developed with cultural institutions such as the Kennedy Center.    Study abroad opportunities have occurred in Africa, Brazil, England and Ireland where students have studied TYA in urban and rural settings, such as the Unicorn Theatre and The Ark and visited venues like Stratford East, and attended shows at the Udderbelly. Graduates land impressive positions in worldwide TYA centers and cultural houses. Groundbreaking studies in TYA have been authored by NYU faculty and graduates.    Beyond TYA, the program offers courses in acting, directing, theatre design, and dramatic literature for adult populations. Students devise theatre for all ages, as well as refine their craft in indigenous, classic, and contemporary drama. The program is committed to building the next generation of teaching artists, and privileges the making, presenting and assessing of theatre. Courses in creative play, physical theatre, masks and puppetry, Brecht and Beckett, world drama, voice and speech for the actor are just a few which build the artistic repertoire of NYU Steinhardt Educational Theatre students.    A well-rounded curriculum in theatre for young audiences and play production sets our NYU program apart from other colleges, and prepares future leaders in the field.

Public readings are performed each weekend with a discussion following each Sunday matinee. Our work honors the history of the Provincetown Playhouse where the early plays of Eugene O&rsquo;Neill, Susan Glaspell, and Edna St. Vincent Millay were first presented. However, this series changes focus by devoting its efforts to development of new works for children, youth and family audiences written by both NYU students and noted authors in New York City, the US, and abroad. Keeping with the goals of the Program in Educational Theatre, our series offers both students and theatre professionals the opportunity to test new ideas and methods within the field of TYA (Theatre for Young Audiences).    In conjunction with the series, the Program in Educational Theatre runs a graduate course, Theatre Practices : Problems in Play Production, the Development of New Plays, which studies theories and methods of play development utilizing the series as a laboratory. Students in the class both observe rehearsals and interact with the playwrights, directors, and dramaturgs over the course of the series.    2015 Season    New Plays for Young Audiences will present rehearsed readings of three new plays for young audiences June 6 &ndash; 21 at the Provincetown Playhouse. An audience discussion with the playwright and director will follow the Sunday readings. All tickets are free.    Mario and the Comet that Stopped the World Book and Lyrics by Gabriel Jason Dean, Music by David Dabbon. The Venedicci Comet is headed straight toward Earth. Apocalyptics predict that it will strike, causing total annihilation; while most scientists speculate it will be a near-miss and Earthlings will behold history&rsquo;s most awe-inspiring celestial event. Either way, Mario is prepared. With a chorus of rubber ducks and soaring songs about the theory of relativity, Mario and the Comet that Stopped the World is a musical adventure-comedy about how loss can be like an earth-shattering comet; but when faced together as a family, it can become a thing of beauty&mdash; a celebration of life and love.

Gabriel Jason Dean &rsquo;s plays have been produced or developed at New York Theatre Workshop, McCarter, The Flea, Oregon Shakespeare, Kennedy Center, Dallas Children&rsquo;s Theatre, and others.

About       New York University is hosting &ldquo;Which Way TYA? New Directions for Theater for Young Audiences&rdquo; on April 27-29 th , 2012.   We have finalized our program. TYA directors, writers and artists are making arrangements to come from across the world. Our presenters include Dr. Gerd Taube (Frankfurt, Germany), Dr. Manon van de Water (U of Wisconsin), Martin Drury (Irish Arts Council), Mary Rose Lloyd (New Victory, New York), Kim Peter Kovac (Kennedy Center, Washington DC), Peter C Brosius (CTC, Minneapolis), Roxanne Schroeder-Arce (U of Texas) and David Wood (London, England). These are just a few amongst a galaxy of TYA field-leaders and practitioners who will be attending.             Questions we&rsquo;ll be asking and exploring at the Forum:          Theater for young audiences is an international movement and the borders are breaking down so how do we receive works from other lands?    Who exactly are our new audiences-- who are we talking to?    Are we as brave as we think we are? How does what we think we should do relate to what we want to do as artists?    Is the writer at the heart of future theatre creation? What has happened to dramaturgy in the brave new world of immersive, experiential, visual/physical theatre?    Theatre for Young Audiences has always been in the forefront of theatrical innovation. So what is next? Theatre for the Very Young? Digital theater?    What have we learned about nurturing the artist of the future-- playwriting, theater-making, performance?    Don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity to be part of the global conversation that will help shape the future of TYA!
