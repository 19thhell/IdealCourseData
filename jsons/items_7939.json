This track is open only to students with a minimum of a baccalaureate or equivalent degree, alone or combined with advanced clinical training. Candidates are chosen based on their academic records and recommendations and an assessment of the candidate's scholarly potential. MCAT or DAT scores may be submitted in lieu of the GRE (when applying, leave the GRE section blank and upload the MCAT/DAT scores at the end as supplemental information). Applicants whose native language is not English and have not obtained a degree from a US institution must submit the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.    Students are awarded the Master of Science degree in Biology degree upon completion of 36 credits with an average GPA of 3.0 or higher, and completion of a qualifying research paper. 24 of the credits must be completed in Biology courses or courses cross-listed with Biology (BIOL-GA). The remaining 12 credits can be completed in graduate courses offered through other departments such as the Department of Biomaterials or Basic Sciences. The qualifying paper (also called a Master\u2019s thesis) can be written based on original laboratory research results (laboratory-based thesis) or an in-depth literature study of an area of oral biology (library-based thesis). The thesis is typically mentored by a faculty member at NYUCD.   Scholarship and Financial Support   At present, there are no scholarships available and all applicants are fully responsible for all costs associated with this program. However there are teaching adjunct positions available . For more information contact Gail Kashishian in the Department of Biology: (212) 998-8212; gk6@nyu.edu .

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .

This track is open only to students with a minimum of a baccalaureate or equivalent degree, alone or combined with advanced clinical training. Candidates are chosen based on their academic records and recommendations and an assessment of the candidate's scholarly potential. MCAT or DAT scores may be submitted in lieu of the GRE (when applying, leave the GRE section blank and upload the MCAT/DAT scores at the end as supplemental information). Applicants whose native language is not English and have not obtained a degree from a US institution must submit the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.    Students are awarded the Master of Science degree in Biology degree upon completion of 36 credits with an average GPA of 3.0 or higher, and completion of a qualifying research paper. 24 of the credits must be completed in Biology courses or courses cross-listed with Biology (BIOL-GA). The remaining 12 credits can be completed in graduate courses offered through other departments such as the Department of Biomaterials or Basic Sciences. The qualifying paper (also called a Master\u2019s thesis) can be written based on original laboratory research results (laboratory-based thesis) or an in-depth literature study of an area of oral biology (library-based thesis). The thesis is typically mentored by a faculty member at NYUCD.   Scholarship and Financial Support   At present, there are no scholarships available and all applicants are fully responsible for all costs associated with this program. However there are teaching adjunct positions available . For more information contact Gail Kashishian in the Department of Biology: (212) 998-8212; gk6@nyu.edu .
