The data collected are used to determine a number of statistics, including mean salaries and the most popular choices for both employment and graduate or professional school enrollment. The Wasserman Center's placement surveys have been an invaluable tool in determining the career-development and employment needs of NYU students and alumni.   Part-time jobs and internships continue to be integral components of a student's learning experience at NYU , as they are conduits, and often prerequisites, to professional experience and full-time employment. Students with these experiences demonstrate greater career focus, and thus have more full-time options after graduation -- a decisive edge, especially in times of economic uncertainty. A sweeping majority of NYU students secure career-related part-time jobs and internships to enhance their experiences outside the classroom, and many of the respondents report finding these opportunities through the Wasserman Center's programs and resources.   New York University continues to have among the most successful graduates in the country , with historically high placement rates for respondents within five months of graduation. Survey results support the fact that savvy, experienced, and well-prepared students emerge from the support and encouragement of the timely and strategically planned initiatives of the Wasserman Center.   The Wasserman Center is committed to supporting students throughout their academic years, providing myriad programs and services that address the gamut of career opportunities. The results of our placement surveys reflect this mission, and inform our strategic partnerships, resources, and services.

The data collected are used to determine a number of statistics, including mean salaries and the most popular choices for both employment and graduate or professional school enrollment. The Wasserman Center's placement surveys have been an invaluable tool in determining the career-development and employment needs of NYU students and alumni.   Part-time jobs and internships continue to be integral components of a student's learning experience at NYU , as they are conduits, and often prerequisites, to professional experience and full-time employment. Students with these experiences demonstrate greater career focus, and thus have more full-time options after graduation -- a decisive edge, especially in times of economic uncertainty. A sweeping majority of NYU students secure career-related part-time jobs and internships to enhance their experiences outside the classroom, and many of the respondents report finding these opportunities through the Wasserman Center's programs and resources.   New York University continues to have among the most successful graduates in the country , with historically high placement rates for respondents within five months of graduation. Survey results support the fact that savvy, experienced, and well-prepared students emerge from the support and encouragement of the timely and strategically planned initiatives of the Wasserman Center.   The Wasserman Center is committed to supporting students throughout their academic years, providing myriad programs and services that address the gamut of career opportunities. The results of our placement surveys reflect this mission, and inform our strategic partnerships, resources, and services.
