Note: There is a lab fee for this course. Mixing a record can be defined in its most basic form as taking the musical elements that the artist and producer have recorded and making it sound fantastic. Easier said than done, as: 1) everyone\u2019s idea of sounds great is different, 2) the mix must, at all costs, work toward realization of the artist and producer\u2019s intent of the vibe of the track, and 3) our skills at constructing sonic masterpieces are always a work-in-progress. In this course, students will dissect and examine the myriad issues that must be addressed when mixing a record. As necessitated by the ever-increasing complexity of digital recording techniques, students will also study and develop methods of logistics and organization, including ProTools sessions, documentation, data management, and backup/archiving. Finally, the course will examine the human factors that are a facet of everyday life as a working professional, and how they relate to artists, bands, producers, studio personnel, management, record labels, session protocol, and care and feeding of the mixer \u2013 you!

Acclaimed and award-winning Producer/Mixer/ Recordist Bob Power (Erkyah Badu, Common, D\u2019Angelo, A Tribe Called Quest) will present a balance of practical and conceptual information designed to expose students to the various recording and production techniques he uses to create his consistent brand of effective production. During the course of the master class, Power and the students will build a production from the ground up: students will participate and observe as Power produces a world-class New York City talent, working in Recorded Music\u2019s state of the art studios. Additionally, part of each day will be devoted to a presentation and discussion of both Power\u2019s and the students\u2019 production work.
