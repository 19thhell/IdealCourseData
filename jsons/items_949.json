The Espresso Book Machine (EBM) is a cutting-edge printing solution which, at the push of a button, prints, binds, and trims a bookstore-quality, &ldquo;perfect-bound&rdquo; paperback book from a digital file. The EBM produces full-color covers and grayscale interior text and illustrations in any font, style or language, opening up a world of possibilities for readers and self-published authors alike.                          With the Espresso Book Machine, we are able to print books from a growing catalog of 3.8 million books, including in-copyright, public domain and out-of-print titles. Two million of these titles are public domain Google Books. The Espresso Book Machine also provides authors with an easy way to get published. Whether you have written a novel, collection of poems, family history, cookbook, memoir or dissertation, you will be able to get printed copies of your book with the Espresso Book Machine.                         What types of Books can the EBM print?     The EBM&rsquo;s technology sources books from its proprietary EspressNet &reg; software, which is a digital catalog of content. The catalogue includes in-copyright titles now made available by publishers such as HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster, McGraw Hill, Hachette, and Macmillan, to name just a few (and with more soon to follow). EspressNet also offers titles in the public domain (out-of-copyright) which have been made available as PDF scans through the Google Books project. If you&rsquo;re looking for an out-of-print or difficult to locate title, our staff will be happy to search this database of several million available volumes for what you need.     The EBM is also a powerful tool for self-published authors who want professionally printed copies of their own books. It allows for flexibility in trim size, book length, and quantities produced, so you can tailor your printing to suit your needs. The EBM can produce novels, memoirs, academic dissertations, recipe collections, poetry, and much more. Additionally, every original book produced here at the NYU Bookstore can be added to EspressNet, which makes it available anywhere in the world where there is an Espresso Book Machine. So whether you&rsquo;re a genealogist printing your family history or an instructor compiling your students&rsquo; work into a unique volume at the end of the semester, you can use the EBM to bring your projects to life!       Self Publishing   This is your opportunity to turn your novel, poetry, journal, family history, or even collection of family recipes into actual beautiful, readable objects. The EBM will transform your work into a paperback book complete with full color cover and a black and white interior, indistinguishable from books produced by traditional publishers. There are no minimum print runs so you can print as many or as few as you want, when you want. You can offer your books for sale or keep it private (printable only by you).
