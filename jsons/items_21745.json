Summer Launchpad is an intensive program that will support startup ventures through the notoriously difficult stage of early development and will provide them with resources, personalized instruction, guidance, and connections to increase the likelihood of their success. Participating teams will be steeped in lean startup principles using techniques for testing hypotheses, experimentation, and iteration as they search for a commercially viable business model.   \u201cAccelerator programs provide emerging entrepreneurs the support they need to help them build successful startups,\u201d said Frank Rimalovski, executive director of the NYU Entrepreneurial Institute and managing director of the NYU Innovation Venture Fund. \u201cNYU\u2019s Summer Launchpad offers the best of university and external resources and programs to the selected teams, while enabling them to work side-by-side with leading entrepreneur and investor mentors.\u201d   The Summer Launchpad will take place at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU (NYU-Poly) Varick Street incubator in Lower Manhattan, which was created four years ago in collaboration with New York City to help emerging companies become thriving businesses.   \u201cNYU-Poly and NYU were among the first to design and implement boot camps that help students transform business concepts into successful ventures,\u201d said Katepalli Sreenivasan, president of the Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly). \u201cTechnology and education are key to addressing some of the world\u2019s most pressing problems \u2013 and the Summer Launchpad will give these student entrepreneurs the tools they need to refine their problem-solving skills and ultimately contribute to the growth of New York City\u2019s innovation economy. When NYU and NYU-Poly become one, as is planned for the very near future, it will unleash an even greater set of possibilities.\u201d   Ten multidisciplinary teams of graduating students from five different schools at NYU (NYU-Poly, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, Tisch School of the Arts, Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, and the College of Arts and Science) have been accepted into the inaugural Launchpad class. Each startup team will receive a no-strings-attached stipend of $7,500. The selected teams span web, mobile, and hardware products across the consumer, enterprise, healthcare, and education sectors.   Each Launchpad team will be paired with entrepreneur and venture investor mentors who will work closely with the teams over the course of the summer to help guide them on the path to achieving their own individual milestones. Mentors are drawn from NYU\u2019s alumni base, as well as from the booming New York City startup community. The entrepreneurs and investors who will participate as mentors include: David Tisch, NYU Law \u201906, managing partner of Box Group; David Aronoff, general partner at Flybridge Capital Partners; Peter Flint, general partner at Polaris Partners; Alexandre Douzet, SCPS \u201999, co-founder and CEO of TheLadders; Paul Berry, Gallatin \u201998, Tisch \u201903, founder and CEO of RebelMouse and former CTO of Huffington Post, among others.     Launchpad will also feature weekly guest lectures by successful entrepreneurs, investors, and startup experts who will share lessons from their past successes and failures. The program will culminate with an expo-style demonstration day, where teams will showcase their startups to potential collaborators, investors, and partners.   \u201cWe believe the NYU Summer Launchpad program will offer graduating NYU student entrepreneurs an exceptional opportunity to benefit from the resources of the University and our strong connections to the broader NYC startup community,\u201d said Lindsey Marshall, programs director of the NYU Entrepreneurial Institute.   The NYU Summer Launchpad is an important addition to a growing array of entrepreneurship programs offered at New York University. NYU already offers a wide range of classes and extra-curricular resources aimed at inspiring, educating, and connecting students and faculty who have an interest in entrepreneurship. The Summer Launchpad builds on the foundational skills provided in the classroom and in programs such as the recently completed $200,000 NYU Entrepreneurs Challenge, and will help drive the success of NYU\u2019s student entrepreneurs long after graduation day.

Summer Launchpad is an intensive program that will support startup ventures through the notoriously difficult stage of early development and will provide them with resources, personalized instruction, guidance, and connections to increase the likelihood of their success. Participating teams will be steeped in lean startup principles using techniques for testing hypotheses, experimentation, and iteration as they search for a commercially viable business model.   \u201cAccelerator programs provide emerging entrepreneurs the support they need to help them build successful startups,\u201d said Frank Rimalovski, executive director of the NYU Entrepreneurial Institute and managing director of the NYU Innovation Venture Fund. \u201cNYU\u2019s Summer Launchpad offers the best of university and external resources and programs to the selected teams, while enabling them to work side-by-side with leading entrepreneur and investor mentors.\u201d   The Summer Launchpad will take place at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU (NYU-Poly) Varick Street incubator in Lower Manhattan, which was created four years ago in collaboration with New York City to help emerging companies become thriving businesses.   \u201cNYU-Poly and NYU were among the first to design and implement boot camps that help students transform business concepts into successful ventures,\u201d said Katepalli Sreenivasan, president of the Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly). \u201cTechnology and education are key to addressing some of the world\u2019s most pressing problems \u2013 and the Summer Launchpad will give these student entrepreneurs the tools they need to refine their problem-solving skills and ultimately contribute to the growth of New York City\u2019s innovation economy. When NYU and NYU-Poly become one, as is planned for the very near future, it will unleash an even greater set of possibilities.\u201d   Ten multidisciplinary teams of graduating students from five different schools at NYU (NYU-Poly, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, Tisch School of the Arts, Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, and the College of Arts and Science) have been accepted into the inaugural Launchpad class. Each startup team will receive a no-strings-attached stipend of $7,500. The selected teams span web, mobile, and hardware products across the consumer, enterprise, healthcare, and education sectors.   Each Launchpad team will be paired with entrepreneur and venture investor mentors who will work closely with the teams over the course of the summer to help guide them on the path to achieving their own individual milestones. Mentors are drawn from NYU\u2019s alumni base, as well as from the booming New York City startup community. The entrepreneurs and investors who will participate as mentors include: David Tisch, NYU Law \u201906, managing partner of Box Group; David Aronoff, general partner at Flybridge Capital Partners; Peter Flint, general partner at Polaris Partners; Alexandre Douzet, SCPS \u201999, co-founder and CEO of TheLadders; Paul Berry, Gallatin \u201998, Tisch \u201903, founder and CEO of RebelMouse and former CTO of Huffington Post, among others.     Launchpad will also feature weekly guest lectures by successful entrepreneurs, investors, and startup experts who will share lessons from their past successes and failures. The program will culminate with an expo-style demonstration day, where teams will showcase their startups to potential collaborators, investors, and partners.   \u201cWe believe the NYU Summer Launchpad program will offer graduating NYU student entrepreneurs an exceptional opportunity to benefit from the resources of the University and our strong connections to the broader NYC startup community,\u201d said Lindsey Marshall, programs director of the NYU Entrepreneurial Institute.   The NYU Summer Launchpad is an important addition to a growing array of entrepreneurship programs offered at New York University. NYU already offers a wide range of classes and extra-curricular resources aimed at inspiring, educating, and connecting students and faculty who have an interest in entrepreneurship. The Summer Launchpad builds on the foundational skills provided in the classroom and in programs such as the recently completed $200,000 NYU Entrepreneurs Challenge, and will help drive the success of NYU\u2019s student entrepreneurs long after graduation day.   The 10 teams that have been selected for the inaugural program, and their NYU student founders, include:   BenchPals Simplifies lab management via secure software, creating a new way for scientists to get their lab work done.

Speaking Freely is available to all NYU undergraduate and graduate students and staff free of charge. The 75-minute language coaching sessions meet once a week for approximately ten weeks each semester at various locations on campus. Each week, you'll learn how to communicate on a different topic, or you might enjoy a related activity--a movie, concert, or neighborhood visit--as part of a small informal language group. No books are required and there\u2019s no pressure of grades!      Languages      Speaking Freely offers sessions in many different languages, including Arabic, Cantonese, Catalan, Czech, French, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, Spanish, and Turkish. Please see the schedule for meeting times and locations. It's the perfect way to meet people and try out a language and culture before you study abroad or visit another country.      Levels      Speaking Freely is a fun way to gain an introduction to a language, and also improve your language skills if you already have the basics. The sessions emphasize conversational knowledge, learning practical words and phrases you might use when traveling or studying abroad, as well as vocabulary related to various aspects of art, history, and culture.      At least two levels of coaching are offered for most of the languages, and a third or fourth level is offered in some languages, depending on instructor availability.     Level 1 is a basic introduction for those who have no experience in the language. Topics include travel, fashion, food, film, money, music, and sports.    Level 2 is slightly more advanced, and meant for those who have completed Level 1 or those who have a little experience in the language. Topics include family, friendship, relationships, customs and traditions, health, and leisure activities.    Level 3 is meant for those who are fairly proficient, and have studied the language for a couple of years or more in high school or college. Topics are determined in concert with the language coach, and based on student interests.   Level 4 is for proficient speakers and the session will be conducted entirely in the language. Topics are determined in concert with the language coach.               Dates Spring 2015 session begins the week of February 9th and will conclude on April 17th.
