Applicants are admitted as freshmen and as transfer students. Candidates are  accepted on the basis of predicted success in the specific programs in which  they are interested. If the applicant meets formal course requirements, his or  her capacity for successful undergraduate work is measured through careful  consideration of secondary school and/or college records; recommendations from  guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and  the personal essay.          Each  applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for  intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special  offerings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered  objectively and evaluated for participation in extracurricular and community  services, in addition to scholarly pursuits.          New  York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents,  and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention  is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities  available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been.  Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential  students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University  and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community  activities is an important factor.          Applicants  who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this  section's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\"              RECOMMENDED  HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION      The  quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a  prescribed pattern of courses. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four  years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three  to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language.  Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP, and  IB courses the applicant has completed in high school. It is strongly  recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the  senior year of high school.              THE  ADMISSIONS PROCESS      All  candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application  and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application.  Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application  available. Any materials that a student or high school official is unable to  submit online may be sent to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York  University, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.          A  complete application will include:      The Common Application and the NYU Member Questions     Official high school transcripts and/or college records for courses for which  academic credit has been earned (and General Educational Development test  scores, if applicable).     The Common Application School Report (for freshman applicants) or Registrar  Report (for transfer applicants).     All required testing should be completed and official results forwarded  electronically by one testing agency to NYU.     The NYU code for SAT and TOEFL scores is 2562; the code for ACT scores is 2838.     At least one Teacher Evaluation.     Personal statement/essay.          Candidates  are urged to complete and file their applications as soon as possible,  especially those seeking financial aid and/or housing. (See below for application  filing deadlines.) No admissions decision will be made without complete  information. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions reserves the right to  substitute or waive particular admissions requirements at the discretion of the admissions committee.          Applications  submitted after the filing deadline are unlikely to be considered by the  committee, except under special circumstances.          Freshman  candidates may choose between Early Decision, Early Decision II, and Regular  Decision admission for September admission. Depending on the notification plan,  applicants will receive an admissions decision on December 15, February 15, or  April 1. Transfer candidates for summer and September admission are notified  beginning in early to mid-May. Transfer candidates for January admission are  notified on a rolling basis, usually beginning on or around November 15.

Please contact the Office of  Undergraduate Admissions or call 212-998-4500 for information regarding program  availability.              CAMPUS  VISITS      All prospective students and their parents are invited to  visit the New York University campus. Opportunities to tour the University, to  meet students and faculty, and to attend classes are available to interested  students.          Both  high school and college students wishing to discuss the choice of a college,  the transfer process, or academic programs are invited to attend an information  session conducted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the Jeffrey S.  Gould Welcome Center located at 50 West Fourth Street. The Office of  Undergraduate Admissions holds daily information sessions and conducts campus  tours, Monday through Friday and many Saturdays, except during University  holidays. Visit the undergraduate admissions website or call 212-998-4524 to  make an appointment for an information session and tour.          Although  interviews are not available, a visit to the campus is strongly recommended. It  is suggested that reservations be made well in advance of your visit.          For  information about booking accommodations for your visit to NYU, please be sure  to check the \"visit us\" section of the admissions website.              STANDARDIZED  TESTS      NYU  seeks talented students from every corner of the globe. Applicants are expected  to demonstrate their talents and mastery of subject matter to support their  applications and to marshal their best case for admission to NYU. As a result,  NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.          To  be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one  of the following testing options:      The SAT Reasoning Test; or The ACT (with Writing Test); or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Students may instead elect to submit results from a nationally accredited exam  that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education and  is administered independently of the student's school.          Note: SAT Subject Test,  AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB diploma) must be submitted  in the form of: one in literature or the humanities; one in math or science;  and one test of the student's choice in any subject.          The  following country-specific examinations are all accepted as admission  credentials; note, however, that only a few of them also carry advanced standing  credit (see details under \"credit by examination\" section, below):     Australia: Australian Capital Territory Year 12 Certificate, New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC), Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET), Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE), South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE), Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE), or Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE); in addition to Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) or Overall Position (OP) positioning Bangladesh: Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Exams Bhutan: Bhutan Higher Secondary Education Certificate Examination (BHSEC) Brazil: Certificado de Conclusao de Ensino Medio + Vestibular (University Entrance Exam) or Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio/Middle Education National Examination (ENEM) Brunei: Brunei Matriculation Examination Bulgaria: Matura Caribbean: Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination Chile: Prueba De Seleccion Universitaria China: Chinese National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) Colombia: Examen de Estado para Ingreso a la Educacion Superior (Saber 11) Costa Rica: Bachillera Nacional Cote D'Ivoire: Baccalaur\u00e9at Croatia: Matura Cyprus: \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u0395\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (Pancyprian Examinations) Czech Republic: Maturitn\u00ed zkou\u0161ka Denmark: Students may submit either of the following exams: Studentereksamen H\u00f8jere Forberedelseseksamen Estonia: Riigieksamitunnistus Ethiopia: Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination Europe: European Baccalaureate (EB) Finland: Ylioppilastutkintotodistus France: Baccalaur\u00e9at Germany: Abitur Greece: Apolytirion Hong Kong: Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Hungary: \u00c9rettsegi vizsga India: Indian School Certificate (ISC), All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) or Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC).

If you have a question as to whether  or not an examination offered in your country would meet our testing  requirements, please send an email to admissions.ops@nyu.edu and we will  confirm. You should not assume that any examinations will meet our testing  requirements unless they are listed above.         Submitting  Scores/   Examination Results          Test  scores or examination results should be submitted by the appropriate  application deadline. If final examination results are unavailable at the time  of application, predicted results may be sent (except in the case of SAT, SAT  Subject, ACT, or AP scores, which must be final when submitted). Predicted  results, which may be subject to additional verification, may only be submitted  by a school official, via one of the following methods:          Naviance/Common Application website;     Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope; or     E-mailed from a clearly identifiable school e-mail address.          If  predicted results are submitted in place of final results, NYU reserves the  right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close  range of the predicted results.          Students  are welcome to submit evidence of national or international academic  accomplishments that they feel may further support their application.          International  students applying to our campus in New York should also review NYU's English  language testing requirements at the Admissions website.          Official  test scores should be sent directly to NYU from the testing agencies. The NYU  code for the College Board (SAT Reasoning Test, SAT I, SAT II  Examinations/Subject Tests, and TOEFL) is 2562; the ACT code for NYU is 2838.

Some of the foreign language  examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core  exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same.      2 Scores in these  languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who  intend to register  for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination.     3 Scores in these  languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper  level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or  the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver 908; 212-998-8110.      4 A score of 650 or  better on either mathematics subject examination (or on the mathematics section  of the SAT general test) places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or  Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these  courses.                  FINANCIAL  AID APPLICATION      After  the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid applications  are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered.          All  freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid  PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recommend that students apply electronically; see our  NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated  with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be  made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must  include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the  FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted  by the processor to New York University. Transfer students applying for  financial aid need only complete the FAFSA.          New  York State residents should also complete the separate application for the  Tuition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid . Students from  other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state  programs if their state grants can be used at New York University.              EARLY  DECISION FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN      NYU  offers two Early Decision application options for freshman applicants who are  certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early  Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th  (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II).          An  Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process      NYU's  Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereby if an  applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that  enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously  submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to  three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from  filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active  applications to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS  PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon  after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have  roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before  confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on  January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after  submitting an enrollment deposit.          We  believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to  provide an early decision ; for that reason,  we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates.          Early  Decision and Financial Aid      NYU  uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision  candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates.  Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply  for admission.          For Early Decision I candidates, we use information  students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide  admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th.  For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted  students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students  are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April,  assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid  (FAFSA) by February 15th.          Students  will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their  estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must  be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial  aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will  be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision  program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for  students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to  apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.          Early  Decision Application Process      Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the  Early Decision I or II option.         Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application  website. Secure the signature of your parent or guardian and your college  adviser/guidance counselor. When you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement  may be submitted along with your high school transcript. Alternatively,  it may be faxed to 212-995-4911 by your counselor.         Submit all supporting materials, such as transcripts and standardized test  scores, to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the appropriate deadline.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS      A  student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in  September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will  be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better  within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls  within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a  vocational nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of  the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited  colleges are eligible for admission.          Except  when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen  apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year  regionally accredited institutions. Transfer applicants must submit official  credentials from all institutions attended, including secondary school  transcripts. Transfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high  school should submit their test results as part of their application. Transfer  applicants who did not take these exams while in high school and have been in  college less than one year must follow the testing requirements listed on the admissions website. All transfer applicants are encouraged to submit scores  from two SAT Subject Tests if previously taken while in high school.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY      Students  who wish to transfer from one school to another within the University must file  an Internal Transfer Application available online prior to the application  deadline (November 1 for the spring term and March 1 for the summer or fall  term).              THE  ENROLLMENT PROCESS      To  be enrolled, an admitted undergraduate candidate must do the following:          Accept the University's offer of admission and pay the required nonrefundable  tuition deposit.         If applicable, pay the required nonrefundable housing deposit.         Have his or her high school and/or college forward a final transcript(s) to the  Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center.         File a medical report.         Make an appointment with the individual school or division for academic  advisement.         Pay balance of tuition and/or housing fees by the stipulated deadlines.     Register for classes when notified.              SPECIAL  (VISITING) STUDENTS      Undergraduate  matriculated students who are currently attending other regionally accredited  four-year colleges and maintaining good standing, both academic and  disciplinary, may be admitted on certification from their own schools. Such  students must be eligible to receive degree credit at their own schools for  courses taken at the University. The approval as a special undergraduate student  is for two terms only and cannot be extended. The Special Student Application  Form for undergraduate students may be obtained online. A $70 application fee  is required. Deadlines for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      All  special students must meet the regulations of the Faculty Committee on  Undergraduate Academic Standards regarding grades and program.              APPLICANTS  WITH INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS      Applicants  to New York University who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents of  the United States must complete the Application for Admission to Undergraduate  Study available online. Please indicate on the application for admission your  country of citizenship, and if you are currently residing in the United States,  your current visa status.          Freshman  applicants (those who are currently attending or who have previously completed  secondary school only) seeking to begin studies in the fall (September)  semester must submit applications and all required credentials on or before the  application deadline that corresponds to their selected notification plan  (November 1 for Early Decision I, and January 1 for Early Decision II and  Regular Decision). Transfer applicants (those who are currently attending or who  have previously attended university or tertiary school) must submit  applications and all required credentials on or before April 1. Transfer  candidates seeking admission for the spring (January) semester must submit  their applications and credentials on or before November 1. Applications will  not be processed until the Office of Undergraduate Admissions receives all  supporting credentials.          All  freshman applicants are required to submit official test results. Please visit  the Admissions website to learn about the admissions requirements.          If  the applicant's secondary education culminated in a maturity certificate  examination, he or she is required to submit an official copy of the grades  received in each subject. All documents submitted for review must be official;  that is, they must be either originals or copies certified by authorized  persons. A \"certified\" photocopy or other copy is one that bears either an  original signature of the registrar or other designated school officials or an  original impression of the institution's seal. Uncertified photocopies are not  acceptable. If these official documents are in a foreign language, they must be  accompanied by an official English translation.          In  addition, every applicant whose native language is not English must take the  Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English  Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE  Academic). Information concerning these examinations may be obtained by  visiting the website. Each student must request that his or her score on this  examination be sent to the NYU Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center, code  2562.          Applicants  residing in the New York area may elect to take the English proficiency test of  the University's American Language Institute, located at 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003. An appointment to take the test may be made by  calling 212-998-7040.          Financial  documentation is not required when filing an application. If the student is  accepted, instructions for completing the Application for Certificate of  Eligibility (AFCOE) online will be included in the acceptance packet.  Appropriate evidence of financial ability must be submitted with the AFCOE to  the Office for International Students and Scholars in order for the appropriate  visa document to be issued. If the applicant's studies are being financed by  means of his or her own savings, parental support, outside private or  government scholarships, or any combination of these, he or she must arrange to  send official letters or similar certification as proof of such support.          New  students may wish to view the multimedia tutorial for new international  students.              THE  AMERICAN LANGUAGE INSTITUTE      The American Language Institute of the School of  Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive  courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language.  It also offers the Advanced Workshop Program in English for students with  substantial English proficiency but insufficient proficiency for undertaking a  full-time academic program. Qualified students in this program can often  combine English study with a part-time academic program. This combination may  constitute a full-time program of study. The institute also offers specialized  courses in accent reduction, grammar, and American business English.          Individuals  who wish to obtain additional information about the American Language Institute  are invited to visit the office of the American Language Institute weekdays throughout  the year between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Fridays until 5 p.m.). They  may also visit the website; contact The American Language Institute, School of  Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003; telephone: 212-998-7040; fax: 212-995-4135; or  e-mail: ali@nyu.edu .              STUDENT  VISAS AND ORIENTATION      Matters  pertaining to student visas and new student orientation are administered by the  Office of Global Services (OGS), 561 La Guardia Place, 1st Floor; 212-998-4720.  In addition, the staff of this office endeavors to aid international students  in taking full advantage of various social, cultural, and recreational  opportunities offered by the University and the city. Specific information on  programs and events can be found at www.nyu.edu/oiss .              READMISSION  OF FORMER STUDENTS      Any  former student who has been out of attendance for more than two consecutive  terms and who wishes to return to the College must apply for readmission.  Applications for readmission are available online. (See admission application  filing deadlines above.) Requests for readmission should be received by April 1  for the summer and fall terms and November 1 for the spring term, but will be  considered after those deadlines on a space available basis.      Students  who have attended another college or university since their last attendance at  New York University must complete the regular application for transfer  admission and submit an official transcript.              SPECIAL  (POSTGRADUATE) STUDENTS      Graduates  of accredited four-year colleges, including the College of Arts and Science and  other schools of New York University, may register as special students in  undergraduate courses for which they meet the prerequisites and that are still  open after matriculated students have registered. Such a student should submit  proof of his or her degree and an application for admission as a special  postgraduate student. The application form can be obtained online.          Deadlines  for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      Students  interested in the post-baccalaureate premedical program should contact the  Preprofessional Center, College of Arts and Science, New York University,  Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901, New York, NY 10003-6688;  212-998-8160.              NYU  SPRING IN NEW YORK      NYU  Spring in New York offers college students from other institutions an opportunity  to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University.  Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in  courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.          In  addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to  the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports  center access, and program office events, including ticket discounts for  Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to  participate in planned excursions around the city.      The  program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at  an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a  competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing  in the academic year of participation.          Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/spring.in.ny .              NYU  JANUARY TERM      New  York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new  scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students  have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest.  During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the  foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as  have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of  year.          Oftentimes,  the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, considering a  full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship  commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new  academic interest or take advantage of the many  cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term  provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major,  minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree  completion, and to concentrate on personal interests.         Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter .              ADVANCED  STANDING      Credit  may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or  university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the  applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any,  advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere  is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the  content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere;  individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability  of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree  of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here.  Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses  were completed within the past 10 years.          Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits  transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at  face value to NYU.          As  with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the  residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following  residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of  course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of  graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU.          A  tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student  upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced  standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation.  Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester  during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter,  a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written  permission of the Office of the Dean.              CREDIT  BY EXAMINATION (INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MATURITY EXAMS)      The  Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the  International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign  maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive  credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in  college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the College's  degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College.          The  maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College  that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special  examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved)  shall not exceed a total of 32.          International  Baccalaureate (IB)      The  College recognizes, for advanced standing credit, higher-level examinations  passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard-level  examinations. Official reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate  Admissions Processing Center for review. See the chart below concerning those  IB test scores for which credit is given.         Maturity  Certificate Examinations          The College will consider the results of certain foreign  maturity certificate examinations for advanced standing credit. They are:      A Levels and Cambridge Pre-U     Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at     German Abitur     Italian Maturit\u00e0 Federal Swiss Maturity Certificate (Matura)      CAS  does not award credit for any other maturity certificate examinations.          Official  reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing  Center. These documents will be added to the student record, but advanced  standing credit for all examinations other than AP and IB will be awarded by  the College Advising Center, Silver 905; 212-998-8130.      See  the chart below for details on those A Level and Cambridge Pre-U test scores  for which credit is given. For the other maturity examinations, please note  that not every subject is awarded credit by the College. Creditworthy results  earn 8 points each (except for the Italian Maturit\u00e0, which is 4 points).          Minimum  scores for receiving credit are:      A Levels: B     Cambridge Pre-U: M2     CAPE: II (out of VII)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at: 12 (out of 20) with coefficient of 5 or better     German Abitur: 10 (out of 15). Credit is only awarded for written exams  (schr.), not for oral (mdl.)     Italian Maturit\u00e0: 7 (out of 10)     Swiss Matura: 4.5 (out of 6)              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT PROGRAM      The College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP)  Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accordance with New York  University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for  test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination. Students  receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding  college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See  the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The  chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equivalencies  are granted.          For  additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500.              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT CREDIT AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM      Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign  language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College also accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower likewise award no credit and have no bearing on placement.

Applicants are admitted as freshmen and as transfer students. Candidates are  accepted on the basis of predicted success in the specific programs in which  they are interested. If the applicant meets formal course requirements, his or  her capacity for successful undergraduate work is measured through careful  consideration of secondary school and/or college records; recommendations from  guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and  the personal essay.          Each  applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for  intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special  offerings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered  objectively and evaluated for participation in extracurricular and community  services, in addition to scholarly pursuits.          New  York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents,  and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention  is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities  available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been.  Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential  students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University  and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community  activities is an important factor.          Applicants  who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this  section's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\"              RECOMMENDED  HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION      The  quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a  prescribed pattern of courses. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four  years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three  to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language.  Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP, and  IB courses the applicant has completed in high school. It is strongly  recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the  senior year of high school.              THE  ADMISSIONS PROCESS      All  candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application  and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application.  Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application  available. Any materials that a student or high school official is unable to  submit online may be sent to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York  University, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.          A  complete application will include:      The Common Application and the NYU Member Questions     Official high school transcripts and/or college records for courses for which  academic credit has been earned (and General Educational Development test  scores, if applicable).     The Common Application School Report (for freshman applicants) or Registrar  Report (for transfer applicants).     All required testing should be completed and official results forwarded  electronically by one testing agency to NYU.     The NYU code for SAT and TOEFL scores is 2562; the code for ACT scores is 2838.     At least one Teacher Evaluation.     Personal statement/essay.          Candidates  are urged to complete and file their applications as soon as possible,  especially those seeking financial aid and/or housing. (See below for application  filing deadlines.) No admissions decision will be made without complete  information. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions reserves the right to  substitute or waive particular admissions requirements at the discretion of the admissions committee.          Applications  submitted after the filing deadline are unlikely to be considered by the  committee, except under special circumstances.          Freshman  candidates may choose between Early Decision, Early Decision II, and Regular  Decision admission for September admission. Depending on the notification plan,  applicants will receive an admissions decision on December 15, February 15, or  April 1. Transfer candidates for summer and September admission are notified  beginning in early to mid-May. Transfer candidates for January admission are  notified on a rolling basis, usually beginning on or around November 15.              ADMISSIONS  APPLICATION FILING DEADLINES      Freshman Applicants for Admission:   Notification  Plan Application  Deadline Notification  Date Early  Decision I November  1 December  15 Early  Decision II January  1 February  15 Regular  Decision January  1 April  1           For  entrance in January (transfer applicants only), applications for admission,  including all required supporting credentials, must be received by November 1.         For  entrance in the summer sessions (transfer applicants only), applications should  be received by April 1.          Applications  for admission received after these dates are unlikely to be considered for  admission except under special circumstances. Please contact the Office of  Undergraduate Admissions or call 212-998-4500 for information regarding program  availability.              CAMPUS  VISITS      All prospective students and their parents are invited to  visit the New York University campus. Opportunities to tour the University, to  meet students and faculty, and to attend classes are available to interested  students.          Both  high school and college students wishing to discuss the choice of a college,  the transfer process, or academic programs are invited to attend an information  session conducted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the Jeffrey S.  Gould Welcome Center located at 50 West Fourth Street. The Office of  Undergraduate Admissions holds daily information sessions and conducts campus  tours, Monday through Friday and many Saturdays, except during University  holidays. Visit the undergraduate admissions website or call 212-998-4524 to  make an appointment for an information session and tour.          Although  interviews are not available, a visit to the campus is strongly recommended. It  is suggested that reservations be made well in advance of your visit.          For  information about booking accommodations for your visit to NYU, please be sure  to check the \"visit us\" section of the admissions website.              STANDARDIZED  TESTS      NYU  seeks talented students from every corner of the globe. Applicants are expected  to demonstrate their talents and mastery of subject matter to support their  applications and to marshal their best case for admission to NYU. As a result,  NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.          To  be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one  of the following testing options:      The SAT Reasoning Test; or The ACT (with Writing Test); or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Students may instead elect to submit results from a nationally accredited exam  that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education and  is administered independently of the student's school.          Note: SAT Subject Test,  AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB diploma) must be submitted  in the form of: one in literature or the humanities; one in math or science;  and one test of the student's choice in any subject.          The  following country-specific examinations are all accepted as admission  credentials; note, however, that only a few of them also carry advanced standing  credit (see details under \"credit by examination\" section, below):     Australia: Australian Capital Territory Year 12 Certificate, New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC), Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET), Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE), South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE), Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE), or Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE); in addition to Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) or Overall Position (OP) positioning Bangladesh: Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Exams Bhutan: Bhutan Higher Secondary Education Certificate Examination (BHSEC) Brazil: Certificado de Conclusao de Ensino Medio + Vestibular (University Entrance Exam) or Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio/Middle Education National Examination (ENEM) Brunei: Brunei Matriculation Examination Bulgaria: Matura Caribbean: Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination Chile: Prueba De Seleccion Universitaria China: Chinese National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) Colombia: Examen de Estado para Ingreso a la Educacion Superior (Saber 11) Costa Rica: Bachillera Nacional Cote D'Ivoire: Baccalaur\u00e9at Croatia: Matura Cyprus: \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u0395\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (Pancyprian Examinations) Czech Republic: Maturitn\u00ed zkou\u0161ka Denmark: Students may submit either of the following exams: Studentereksamen H\u00f8jere Forberedelseseksamen Estonia: Riigieksamitunnistus Ethiopia: Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination Europe: European Baccalaureate (EB) Finland: Ylioppilastutkintotodistus France: Baccalaur\u00e9at Germany: Abitur Greece: Apolytirion Hong Kong: Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Hungary: \u00c9rettsegi vizsga India: Indian School Certificate (ISC), All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) or Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC).

If you have a question as to whether  or not an examination offered in your country would meet our testing  requirements, please send an email to admissions.ops@nyu.edu and we will  confirm. You should not assume that any examinations will meet our testing  requirements unless they are listed above.         Submitting  Scores/   Examination Results          Test  scores or examination results should be submitted by the appropriate  application deadline. If final examination results are unavailable at the time  of application, predicted results may be sent (except in the case of SAT, SAT  Subject, ACT, or AP scores, which must be final when submitted). Predicted  results, which may be subject to additional verification, may only be submitted  by a school official, via one of the following methods:          Naviance/Common Application website;     Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope; or     E-mailed from a clearly identifiable school e-mail address.          If  predicted results are submitted in place of final results, NYU reserves the  right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close  range of the predicted results.          Students  are welcome to submit evidence of national or international academic  accomplishments that they feel may further support their application.          International  students applying to our campus in New York should also review NYU's English  language testing requirements at the Admissions website.          Official  test scores should be sent directly to NYU from the testing agencies. The NYU  code for the College Board (SAT Reasoning Test, SAT I, SAT II  Examinations/Subject Tests, and TOEFL) is 2562; the ACT code for NYU is 2838.

Some of the foreign language  examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core  exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same.      2 Scores in these  languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who  intend to register  for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination.     3 Scores in these  languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper  level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or  the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver 908; 212-998-8110.      4 A score of 650 or  better on either mathematics subject examination (or on the mathematics section  of the SAT general test) places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or  Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these  courses.                  FINANCIAL  AID APPLICATION      After  the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid applications  are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered.          All  freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid  PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recommend that students apply electronically; see our  NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated  with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be  made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must  include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the  FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted  by the processor to New York University. Transfer students applying for  financial aid need only complete the FAFSA.          New  York State residents should also complete the separate application for the  Tuition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid . Students from  other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state  programs if their state grants can be used at New York University.              EARLY  DECISION FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN      NYU  offers two Early Decision application options for freshman applicants who are  certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early  Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th  (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II).          An  Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process      NYU's  Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereby if an  applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that  enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously  submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to  three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from  filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active  applications to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS  PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon  after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have  roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before  confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on  January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after  submitting an enrollment deposit.          We  believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to  provide an early decision ; for that reason,  we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates.          Early  Decision and Financial Aid      NYU  uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision  candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates.  Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply  for admission.          For Early Decision I candidates, we use information  students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide  admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th.  For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted  students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students  are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April,  assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid  (FAFSA) by February 15th.          Students  will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their  estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must  be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial  aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will  be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision  program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for  students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to  apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.          Early  Decision Application Process      Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the  Early Decision I or II option.         Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application  website. Secure the signature of your parent or guardian and your college  adviser/guidance counselor. When you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement  may be submitted along with your high school transcript. Alternatively,  it may be faxed to 212-995-4911 by your counselor.         Submit all supporting materials, such as transcripts and standardized test  scores, to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the appropriate deadline.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS      A  student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in  September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will  be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better  within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls  within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a  vocational nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of  the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited  colleges are eligible for admission.          Except  when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen  apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year  regionally accredited institutions. Transfer applicants must submit official  credentials from all institutions attended, including secondary school  transcripts. Transfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high  school should submit their test results as part of their application. Transfer  applicants who did not take these exams while in high school and have been in  college less than one year must follow the testing requirements listed on the admissions website. All transfer applicants are encouraged to submit scores  from two SAT Subject Tests if previously taken while in high school.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY      Students  who wish to transfer from one school to another within the University must file  an Internal Transfer Application available online prior to the application  deadline (November 1 for the spring term and March 1 for the summer or fall  term).              THE  ENROLLMENT PROCESS      To  be enrolled, an admitted undergraduate candidate must do the following:          Accept the University's offer of admission and pay the required nonrefundable  tuition deposit.         If applicable, pay the required nonrefundable housing deposit.         Have his or her high school and/or college forward a final transcript(s) to the  Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center.         File a medical report.         Make an appointment with the individual school or division for academic  advisement.         Pay balance of tuition and/or housing fees by the stipulated deadlines.     Register for classes when notified.              SPECIAL  (VISITING) STUDENTS      Undergraduate  matriculated students who are currently attending other regionally accredited  four-year colleges and maintaining good standing, both academic and  disciplinary, may be admitted on certification from their own schools. Such  students must be eligible to receive degree credit at their own schools for  courses taken at the University. The approval as a special undergraduate student  is for two terms only and cannot be extended. The Special Student Application  Form for undergraduate students may be obtained online. A $70 application fee  is required. Deadlines for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      All  special students must meet the regulations of the Faculty Committee on  Undergraduate Academic Standards regarding grades and program.              APPLICANTS  WITH INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS      Applicants  to New York University who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents of  the United States must complete the Application for Admission to Undergraduate  Study available online. Please indicate on the application for admission your  country of citizenship, and if you are currently residing in the United States,  your current visa status.          Freshman  applicants (those who are currently attending or who have previously completed  secondary school only) seeking to begin studies in the fall (September)  semester must submit applications and all required credentials on or before the  application deadline that corresponds to their selected notification plan  (November 1 for Early Decision I, and January 1 for Early Decision II and  Regular Decision). Transfer applicants (those who are currently attending or who  have previously attended university or tertiary school) must submit  applications and all required credentials on or before April 1. Transfer  candidates seeking admission for the spring (January) semester must submit  their applications and credentials on or before November 1. Applications will  not be processed until the Office of Undergraduate Admissions receives all  supporting credentials.          All  freshman applicants are required to submit official test results. Please visit  the Admissions website to learn about the admissions requirements.          If  the applicant's secondary education culminated in a maturity certificate  examination, he or she is required to submit an official copy of the grades  received in each subject. All documents submitted for review must be official;  that is, they must be either originals or copies certified by authorized  persons. A \"certified\" photocopy or other copy is one that bears either an  original signature of the registrar or other designated school officials or an  original impression of the institution's seal. Uncertified photocopies are not  acceptable. If these official documents are in a foreign language, they must be  accompanied by an official English translation.          In  addition, every applicant whose native language is not English must take the  Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English  Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE  Academic). Information concerning these examinations may be obtained by  visiting the website. Each student must request that his or her score on this  examination be sent to the NYU Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center, code  2562.          Applicants  residing in the New York area may elect to take the English proficiency test of  the University's American Language Institute, located at 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003. An appointment to take the test may be made by  calling 212-998-7040.          Financial  documentation is not required when filing an application. If the student is  accepted, instructions for completing the Application for Certificate of  Eligibility (AFCOE) online will be included in the acceptance packet.  Appropriate evidence of financial ability must be submitted with the AFCOE to  the Office for International Students and Scholars in order for the appropriate  visa document to be issued. If the applicant's studies are being financed by  means of his or her own savings, parental support, outside private or  government scholarships, or any combination of these, he or she must arrange to  send official letters or similar certification as proof of such support.          New  students may wish to view the multimedia tutorial for new international  students.              THE  AMERICAN LANGUAGE INSTITUTE      The American Language Institute of the School of  Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive  courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language.  It also offers the Advanced Workshop Program in English for students with  substantial English proficiency but insufficient proficiency for undertaking a  full-time academic program. Qualified students in this program can often  combine English study with a part-time academic program. This combination may  constitute a full-time program of study. The institute also offers specialized  courses in accent reduction, grammar, and American business English.          Individuals  who wish to obtain additional information about the American Language Institute  are invited to visit the office of the American Language Institute weekdays throughout  the year between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Fridays until 5 p.m.). They  may also visit the website; contact The American Language Institute, School of  Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003; telephone: 212-998-7040; fax: 212-995-4135; or  e-mail: ali@nyu.edu .

In addition, the staff of this office endeavors to aid international students  in taking full advantage of various social, cultural, and recreational  opportunities offered by the University and the city. Specific information on  programs and events can be found at www.nyu.edu/oiss .              READMISSION  OF FORMER STUDENTS      Any  former student who has been out of attendance for more than two consecutive  terms and who wishes to return to the College must apply for readmission.  Applications for readmission are available online. (See admission application  filing deadlines above.) Requests for readmission should be received by April 1  for the summer and fall terms and November 1 for the spring term, but will be  considered after those deadlines on a space available basis.      Students  who have attended another college or university since their last attendance at  New York University must complete the regular application for transfer  admission and submit an official transcript.              SPECIAL  (POSTGRADUATE) STUDENTS      Graduates  of accredited four-year colleges, including the College of Arts and Science and  other schools of New York University, may register as special students in  undergraduate courses for which they meet the prerequisites and that are still  open after matriculated students have registered. Such a student should submit  proof of his or her degree and an application for admission as a special  postgraduate student. The application form can be obtained online.

NYU  SPRING IN NEW YORK      NYU  Spring in New York offers college students from other institutions an opportunity  to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University.  Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in  courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.          In  addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to  the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports  center access, and program office events, including ticket discounts for  Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to  participate in planned excursions around the city.      The  program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at  an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a  competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing  in the academic year of participation.          Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/spring.in.ny .              NYU  JANUARY TERM      New  York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new  scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students  have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest.  During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the  foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as  have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of  year.          Oftentimes,  the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, considering a  full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship  commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new  academic interest or take advantage of the many  cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term  provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major,  minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree  completion, and to concentrate on personal interests.         Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter .              ADVANCED  STANDING      Credit  may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or  university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the  applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any,  advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere  is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the  content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere;  individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability  of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree  of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here.  Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses  were completed within the past 10 years.          Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits  transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at  face value to NYU.          As  with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the  residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following  residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of  course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of  graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU.          A  tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student  upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced  standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation.  Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester  during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter,  a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written  permission of the Office of the Dean.              CREDIT  BY EXAMINATION (INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MATURITY EXAMS)      The  Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the  International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign  maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive  credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in  college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the College's  degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College.          The  maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College  that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special  examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved)  shall not exceed a total of 32.          International  Baccalaureate (IB)      The  College recognizes, for advanced standing credit, higher-level examinations  passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard-level  examinations. Official reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate  Admissions Processing Center for review. See the chart below concerning those  IB test scores for which credit is given.         Maturity  Certificate Examinations          The College will consider the results of certain foreign  maturity certificate examinations for advanced standing credit. They are:      A Levels and Cambridge Pre-U     Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at     German Abitur     Italian Maturit\u00e0 Federal Swiss Maturity Certificate (Matura)      CAS  does not award credit for any other maturity certificate examinations.          Official  reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing  Center. These documents will be added to the student record, but advanced  standing credit for all examinations other than AP and IB will be awarded by  the College Advising Center, Silver 905; 212-998-8130.      See  the chart below for details on those A Level and Cambridge Pre-U test scores  for which credit is given. For the other maturity examinations, please note  that not every subject is awarded credit by the College. Creditworthy results  earn 8 points each (except for the Italian Maturit\u00e0, which is 4 points).          Minimum  scores for receiving credit are:      A Levels: B     Cambridge Pre-U: M2     CAPE: II (out of VII)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at: 12 (out of 20) with coefficient of 5 or better     German Abitur: 10 (out of 15). Credit is only awarded for written exams  (schr.), not for oral (mdl.)     Italian Maturit\u00e0: 7 (out of 10)     Swiss Matura: 4.5 (out of 6)              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT PROGRAM      The College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP)  Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accordance with New York  University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for  test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination. Students  receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding  college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See  the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The  chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equivalencies  are granted.          For  additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500.              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT CREDIT AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM      Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign  language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College also accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower likewise award no credit and have no bearing on placement.

The other four points cannot be applied towards  psychology major or minor requirements.      19 A Level/Pre-U credits cannot be  counted towards the religious studies major or minor.      20 Sociology majors may request  departmental approval for counting four of the eight A Level/Pre-U credits  toward the major as one of the three required SOC-UA electives. However, the  credits never exempt students from any of the introductory courses in Sociology  (SOC-UA 1, 2, 3).

If you recently transferred to Gallatin, the information on this page will help guide you as you transition into the school and begin your career as a Gallatin student. Prospective transfer students should refer to the FAQs for information regarding the admission process, important deadlines, and the structure of advising at Gallatin.                               Murals by the artist Peter Halley on permanent display at the Gallatin School.           Preparing for your transfer   Whether you are already an NYU student or currently attending an external institution, the decision to transfer to Gallatin is a very serious one. When you transfer to Gallatin, you take on a completely different set of degree requirements, gain a new faculty adviser and new student colleagues, and adopt Gallatin's unique educational philosophy. As you prepare for your transfer, we recommend that you think carefully about your educational goals and how a liberal arts education at Gallatin can help you achieve them. This means both researching the Gallatin degree requirements and curriculum and thinking realistically about how you might develop your individualized concentration as a Gallatin student. These FAQs aim to guide you as you prepare for your transfer.                                                  I just learned about Gallatin. How can I find out more about the school? Can you tell me how Gallatin works?                                 The best way to find out more about Gallatin is to attend an information session.   If you have attended an info session and have additional questions, you may meet with an adviser on Fridays (during the academic year) between 10:00 and 12:00. These walk-in hours are held at the Academic Resource Center, 18 Washington Place. Because of the volume of students interested in Gallatin, we ask that you first attend an info session before meeting with an adviser.                                                              When am I eligible to transfer?                                 If you are currently a student in another NYU school or college, you must be in at least your second semester of consecutive full-time study at your current program to be eligible for an internal transfer. Because Gallatin allows students to transfer a maximum of 64 earned units, both internal and external transfer students should plan to start at Gallatin no later than the first semester of their junior year.   Transfer students to Gallatin who have completed more than 64 credits (AP and IB credit included) at their previous school(s) prior to matriculation at Gallatin will see a reduction in their cumulative earned hours (EHRS on the transcript) down to 64 credits once Gallatin has updated their records. This policy is stated in our admissions materials : transfer students will be eligible to receive a maximum of 64 credits of advanced standing upon their matriculation at Gallatin. The Gallatin faculty has determined that 64 credits in residence at Gallatin, under the guidance and mentoring of a Gallatin adviser, are the minimum amount of course work and time required for students to develop a proper concentration and establish an individualized program. This does not mean that you must complete 64 more credits in only Gallatin courses, but that you must complete a minimum of 64 credits at NYU under the supervision of your Gallatin adviser.                                                              How do I apply to transfer? Can you tell me what is required for the transfer application?                                 The application process (including decisions) is handled by NYU's main Office of Admissions Feel free to contact them directly with questions about applying.                                                              When is the transfer application due? When will I receive a decision?                                 For information on application deadlines, refer to Key Dates and Deadlines on the Admissions Office page. Please note that transfer applications are reviewed by NYU's Office of Admissions; Gallatin advisers do not participate in admission decisions.                                                                Does Gallatin have requirements?                                 Yes. You can learn more about the Gallatin degree requirements here .                                                                  Can you tell me if my previous coursework will fulfill Gallatin degree   requirements?                                 If you are applying to transfer to Gallatin from another school within NYU, your previous coursework may satisfy Gallatin's degree requirements.     If you are applying from an external institution, NYU's Office of Admissions will post your credits during your first semester. At that point, the transfer student adviser will review your transfer credits and make sure they are appropriately satisfying Gallatin's degree requirements.                                                                Can I study away if I transfer to Gallatin?                                 Yes. Although you must be in New York during your first semester at Gallatin, you can still study away in later semesters.                                                              Can transfer students to Gallatin do internships?                               Yes. You can find information about Gallatin internships, including the proposal form to submit to your adviser, here. If you would like to register an internship for credit in the summer before starting at Gallatin, you may submit the proposal form to the transfer student adviser.   Students in other NYU schools who are interested in Gallatin internships should first contact their home school adviser.                                                                Can I meet with a Gallatin adviser before I transfer? Can you tell me what courses I should take before I transfer?                                 Because advisers at Gallatin must prioritize meeting with current Gallatin students, it is not possible for all prospective transfer students to meet with a Gallatin adviser before matriculation. We encourage you to discuss your plans to transfer an adviser in your current school. If you have attended a Gallatin info session and studied the information on the Gallatin website, and then still have additional questions, Gallatin's transfer student adviser holds walk-in hours for prospective transfer students on Fridays from 10:00 to 12:00 in the Academic Resource Center, 18 Washington Place. Be aware that transfer applications are reviewed by NYU's Office of Admissions; Gallatin advisers do not participate in admission decisions.   Gallatin is a school of individualized study; therefore the &quot;prereqs&quot; you take before applying will vary depending on your course of study. There is no particular set of courses that are recommended or required before transferring.                                                                Will my financial aid be affected by transferring to Gallatin?                                 Because each student has a unique financial situation, all questions regarding Financial Aid should be addressed to the Financial Aid Office.                                                                I want to study ________. Can I do that Gallatin?                                 There is no easy answer to this question, but there are a few steps you can take so that you can get a better sense of whether what you want to study is feasible. First, look over the Gallatin degree requirements and figure out what requirements you have already fulfilled. Then begin drafting what your next several semesters at NYU might look like. Keep your remaining degree requirements in mind as you research the courses you would like to take at Gallatin and at the other schools within NYU. Are the kinds of courses you want to take offered at NYU? Do you have enough semesters remaining to reach the level you want? What prerequisites do you need? If you plan to study abroad, when will this fit into your plan of study? Will you incorporate an internship into your schedule? These are just some of the questions you should be asking yourself as you map out your trajectory as a Gallatin student.                                                              I've just been admitted to Gallatin. When can I get started?                               Congratulations! Be sure to follow all the instructions in the acceptance message you received from the Office of Admissions. A Gallatin adviser will directly contact you just as soon as your record is updated.                        Gallatin-Bound LS Core Students   As an LS Core student, you may be in the unique position of knowing that you want to transfer to Gallatin as early as the first semester of your first year. Stay in regular contact with your LS adviser and make sure that he or she knows of your plans to transfer to Gallatin. The information below will help you to understand how your LS courses will fulfill some of the Gallatin degree requirements.   Undergraduate Core Requirement     First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar: waived for LS Core students   First-Year Writing Seminar: Satisfied by LS Writing I WRI-UF 101   First-Year Research Seminar: Satisfied by LS Writing II WRI-UF 102   Gallatin Interdisciplinary Seminars (16 units required): Gallatin Interdisciplinary Seminar (IDSEM-UG) courses taken prior to matriculation at Gallatin will count toward this requirement.   Other Gallatin credits (16 units required): Gallatin Advanced Writing Courses (WRTNG-UG), Arts Workshops (ARTS-UG), Community Learning (CLI-UG), internships, and other Gallatin courses taken prior to matriculation in Gallatin will count toward this requirement.     Foundation Requirement     Humanities (8 units required): Satisfied by LS Core (CFI-UF 101, CFII-UF 102).   Social Science (8 units required): Satisfied by LS Core (SFI-UF 101, SFII-UF 102).   Math/Science (4 units required): Satisfied by math/science courses (not AP credits).   Global Cultures (4 units required): Satisfied by LS Core courses.   Pre-Modern (4 units required): approved Gallatin and CAS courses taken before or after matriculation at Gallatin will count toward this requirement     Early Modern (4 units required): approved Gallatin and CAS courses taken before or after matriculation at Gallatin will count toward this requirement.     Other Requirements     Total Units Required to Graduate: 128 units.   Academic Good Standing: minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0.   Residency Requirement: The last 32 units must be completed at NYU (either at the Washington Square campus or at one of NYU\u2019s study away sites).   Transfer Units: The Gallatin faculty has determined that 64 units in residence at Gallatin (taken over the course of two years) under the guidance and mentoring of a Gallatin adviser is the minimum amount of course work and time required for students to develop a proper concentration and establish an individualized program. Therefore, transfer students to the Gallatin School will be eligible to transfer a maximum of 64 units upon their matriculation at Gallatin. To fulfill Gallatin\u2019s degree requirements, all students must complete a minimum of 64 credits while matriculated at Gallatin.   Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration: students who transfer with 64 or more earned units must complete this requirement in conversation with their primary faculty advisers in the first semester at Gallatin.   Colloquium: All Gallatin students must complete this requirement during their senior year.              Your first semester at Gallatin     We are excited that you have decided that Gallatin is the right school for you. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of your first semester here.     Primary Faculty Adviser       Just before the start of your first semester, you will be paired with a primary faculty adviser based on your responses to the Gallatin Advising Questionnaire. We recommend that students meet with their primary faculty advisers regularly, at least 3-4 times per semester. As with any relationship, it takes time to get to know your adviser. If you speak to your adviser only once or twice, then he or she may not be able to give you the guidance and mentoring that is needed to develop your individualized concentration.     Class Advisers     While your primary faculty adviser will be your main intellectual mentor, you will also work closely with class advisers - initially the transfer student adviser, and the first-year, sophomore, junior, or senior class adviser once you've settled into Gallatin. Class advisers provide both additional academic support as well as help with policies and procedures.       The Gallatin and larger NYU communities       We encourage transfer students to become active members of Gallatin and NYU. As a small liberal arts school within a large university, Gallatin offers distinct Student Life activities. It is easy to get involved and to meet other Gallatin students who share your interests. NYU also has a Transfer and Transitioning Students Services Office .

Applicants are admitted as freshmen and as transfer students. Candidates are  accepted on the basis of predicted success in the specific programs in which  they are interested. If the applicant meets formal course requirements, his or  her capacity for successful undergraduate work is measured through careful  consideration of secondary school and/or college records; recommendations from  guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and  the personal essay.          Each  applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for  intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special  offerings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered  objectively and evaluated for participation in extracurricular and community  services, in addition to scholarly pursuits.          New  York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents,  and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention  is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities  available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been.  Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential  students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University  and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community  activities is an important factor.          Applicants  who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this  section's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\"              RECOMMENDED  HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION      The  quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a  prescribed pattern of courses. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four  years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three  to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language.  Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP, and  IB courses the applicant has completed in high school. It is strongly  recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the  senior year of high school.              THE  ADMISSIONS PROCESS      All  candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application  and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application.  Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application  available. Any materials that a student or high school official is unable to  submit online may be sent to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York  University, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.          A  complete application will include:      The Common Application and the NYU Member Questions     Official high school transcripts and/or college records for courses for which  academic credit has been earned (and General Educational Development test  scores, if applicable).     The Common Application School Report (for freshman applicants) or Registrar  Report (for transfer applicants).     All required testing should be completed and official results forwarded  electronically by one testing agency to NYU.     The NYU code for SAT and TOEFL scores is 2562; the code for ACT scores is 2838.     At least one Teacher Evaluation.     Personal statement/essay.          Candidates  are urged to complete and file their applications as soon as possible,  especially those seeking financial aid and/or housing. (See below for application  filing deadlines.) No admissions decision will be made without complete  information. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions reserves the right to  substitute or waive particular admissions requirements at the discretion of the admissions committee.          Applications  submitted after the filing deadline are unlikely to be considered by the  committee, except under special circumstances.          Freshman  candidates may choose between Early Decision, Early Decision II, and Regular  Decision admission for September admission. Depending on the notification plan,  applicants will receive an admissions decision on December 15, February 15, or  April 1. Transfer candidates for summer and September admission are notified  beginning in early to mid-May. Transfer candidates for January admission are  notified on a rolling basis, usually beginning on or around November 15.              ADMISSIONS  APPLICATION FILING DEADLINES      Freshman Applicants for Admission:   Notification  Plan Application  Deadline Notification  Date Early  Decision I November  1 December  15 Early  Decision II January  1 February  15 Regular  Decision January  1 April  1           For  entrance in January (transfer applicants only), applications for admission,  including all required supporting credentials, must be received by November 1.         For  entrance in the summer sessions (transfer applicants only), applications should  be received by April 1.          Applications  for admission received after these dates are unlikely to be considered for  admission except under special circumstances. Please contact the Office of  Undergraduate Admissions or call 212-998-4500 for information regarding program  availability.              CAMPUS  VISITS      All prospective students and their parents are invited to  visit the New York University campus. Opportunities to tour the University, to  meet students and faculty, and to attend classes are available to interested  students.          Both  high school and college students wishing to discuss the choice of a college,  the transfer process, or academic programs are invited to attend an information  session conducted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the Jeffrey S.  Gould Welcome Center located at 50 West Fourth Street. The Office of  Undergraduate Admissions holds daily information sessions and conducts campus  tours, Monday through Friday and many Saturdays, except during University  holidays. Visit the undergraduate admissions website or call 212-998-4524 to  make an appointment for an information session and tour.          Although  interviews are not available, a visit to the campus is strongly recommended. It  is suggested that reservations be made well in advance of your visit.          For  information about booking accommodations for your visit to NYU, please be sure  to check the \"visit us\" section of the admissions website.              STANDARDIZED  TESTS      NYU  seeks talented students from every corner of the globe. Applicants are expected  to demonstrate their talents and mastery of subject matter to support their  applications and to marshal their best case for admission to NYU. As a result,  NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.          To  be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one  of the following testing options:      The SAT Reasoning Test; or The ACT (with Writing Test); or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Students may instead elect to submit results from a nationally accredited exam  that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education and  is administered independently of the student's school.          Note: SAT Subject Test,  AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB diploma) must be submitted  in the form of: one in literature or the humanities; one in math or science;  and one test of the student's choice in any subject.          The  following country-specific examinations are all accepted as admission  credentials; note, however, that only a few of them also carry advanced standing  credit (see details under \"credit by examination\" section, below):     Australia: Australian Capital Territory Year 12 Certificate, New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC), Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET), Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE), South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE), Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE), or Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE); in addition to Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) or Overall Position (OP) positioning Bangladesh: Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Exams Bhutan: Bhutan Higher Secondary Education Certificate Examination (BHSEC) Brazil: Certificado de Conclusao de Ensino Medio + Vestibular (University Entrance Exam) or Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio/Middle Education National Examination (ENEM) Brunei: Brunei Matriculation Examination Bulgaria: Matura Caribbean: Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination Chile: Prueba De Seleccion Universitaria China: Chinese National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) Colombia: Examen de Estado para Ingreso a la Educacion Superior (Saber 11) Costa Rica: Bachillera Nacional Cote D'Ivoire: Baccalaur\u00e9at Croatia: Matura Cyprus: \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u0395\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (Pancyprian Examinations) Czech Republic: Maturitn\u00ed zkou\u0161ka Denmark: Students may submit either of the following exams: Studentereksamen H\u00f8jere Forberedelseseksamen Estonia: Riigieksamitunnistus Ethiopia: Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination Europe: European Baccalaureate (EB) Finland: Ylioppilastutkintotodistus France: Baccalaur\u00e9at Germany: Abitur Greece: Apolytirion Hong Kong: Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Hungary: \u00c9rettsegi vizsga India: Indian School Certificate (ISC), All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) or Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC).

If you have a question as to whether  or not an examination offered in your country would meet our testing  requirements, please send an email to admissions.ops@nyu.edu and we will  confirm. You should not assume that any examinations will meet our testing  requirements unless they are listed above.         Submitting  Scores/   Examination Results          Test  scores or examination results should be submitted by the appropriate  application deadline. If final examination results are unavailable at the time  of application, predicted results may be sent (except in the case of SAT, SAT  Subject, ACT, or AP scores, which must be final when submitted). Predicted  results, which may be subject to additional verification, may only be submitted  by a school official, via one of the following methods:          Naviance/Common Application website;     Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope; or     E-mailed from a clearly identifiable school e-mail address.          If  predicted results are submitted in place of final results, NYU reserves the  right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close  range of the predicted results.          Students  are welcome to submit evidence of national or international academic  accomplishments that they feel may further support their application.          International  students applying to our campus in New York should also review NYU's English  language testing requirements at the Admissions website.          Official  test scores should be sent directly to NYU from the testing agencies. The NYU  code for the College Board (SAT Reasoning Test, SAT I, SAT II  Examinations/Subject Tests, and TOEFL) is 2562; the ACT code for NYU is 2838.

Some of the foreign language  examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core  exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same.      2 Scores in these  languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who  intend to register  for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination.     3 Scores in these  languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper  level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or  the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver 908; 212-998-8110.      4 A score of 650 or  better on either mathematics subject examination (or on the mathematics section  of the SAT general test) places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or  Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these  courses.                  FINANCIAL  AID APPLICATION      After  the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid applications  are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered.          All  freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid  PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recommend that students apply electronically; see our  NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated  with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be  made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must  include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the  FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted  by the processor to New York University. Transfer students applying for  financial aid need only complete the FAFSA.          New  York State residents should also complete the separate application for the  Tuition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid . Students from  other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state  programs if their state grants can be used at New York University.              EARLY  DECISION FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN      NYU  offers two Early Decision application options for freshman applicants who are  certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early  Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th  (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II).          An  Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process      NYU's  Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereby if an  applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that  enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously  submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to  three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from  filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active  applications to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS  PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon  after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have  roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before  confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on  January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after  submitting an enrollment deposit.          We  believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to  provide an early decision ; for that reason,  we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates.          Early  Decision and Financial Aid      NYU  uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision  candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates.  Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply  for admission.          For Early Decision I candidates, we use information  students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide  admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th.  For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted  students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students  are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April,  assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid  (FAFSA) by February 15th.          Students  will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their  estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must  be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial  aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will  be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision  program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for  students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to  apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.          Early  Decision Application Process      Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the  Early Decision I or II option.         Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application  website. Secure the signature of your parent or guardian and your college  adviser/guidance counselor. When you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement  may be submitted along with your high school transcript. Alternatively,  it may be faxed to 212-995-4911 by your counselor.         Submit all supporting materials, such as transcripts and standardized test  scores, to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the appropriate deadline.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS      A  student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in  September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will  be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better  within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls  within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a  vocational nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of  the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited  colleges are eligible for admission.          Except  when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen  apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year  regionally accredited institutions. Transfer applicants must submit official  credentials from all institutions attended, including secondary school  transcripts. Transfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high  school should submit their test results as part of their application. Transfer  applicants who did not take these exams while in high school and have been in  college less than one year must follow the testing requirements listed on the admissions website. All transfer applicants are encouraged to submit scores  from two SAT Subject Tests if previously taken while in high school.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY      Students  who wish to transfer from one school to another within the University must file  an Internal Transfer Application available online prior to the application  deadline (November 1 for the spring term and March 1 for the summer or fall  term).              THE  ENROLLMENT PROCESS      To  be enrolled, an admitted undergraduate candidate must do the following:          Accept the University's offer of admission and pay the required nonrefundable  tuition deposit.         If applicable, pay the required nonrefundable housing deposit.         Have his or her high school and/or college forward a final transcript(s) to the  Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center.         File a medical report.         Make an appointment with the individual school or division for academic  advisement.         Pay balance of tuition and/or housing fees by the stipulated deadlines.     Register for classes when notified.              SPECIAL  (VISITING) STUDENTS      Undergraduate  matriculated students who are currently attending other regionally accredited  four-year colleges and maintaining good standing, both academic and  disciplinary, may be admitted on certification from their own schools. Such  students must be eligible to receive degree credit at their own schools for  courses taken at the University. The approval as a special undergraduate student  is for two terms only and cannot be extended. The Special Student Application  Form for undergraduate students may be obtained online. A $70 application fee  is required. Deadlines for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      All  special students must meet the regulations of the Faculty Committee on  Undergraduate Academic Standards regarding grades and program.              APPLICANTS  WITH INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS      Applicants  to New York University who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents of  the United States must complete the Application for Admission to Undergraduate  Study available online. Please indicate on the application for admission your  country of citizenship, and if you are currently residing in the United States,  your current visa status.          Freshman  applicants (those who are currently attending or who have previously completed  secondary school only) seeking to begin studies in the fall (September)  semester must submit applications and all required credentials on or before the  application deadline that corresponds to their selected notification plan  (November 1 for Early Decision I, and January 1 for Early Decision II and  Regular Decision). Transfer applicants (those who are currently attending or who  have previously attended university or tertiary school) must submit  applications and all required credentials on or before April 1. Transfer  candidates seeking admission for the spring (January) semester must submit  their applications and credentials on or before November 1. Applications will  not be processed until the Office of Undergraduate Admissions receives all  supporting credentials.          All  freshman applicants are required to submit official test results. Please visit  the Admissions website to learn about the admissions requirements.          If  the applicant's secondary education culminated in a maturity certificate  examination, he or she is required to submit an official copy of the grades  received in each subject. All documents submitted for review must be official;  that is, they must be either originals or copies certified by authorized  persons. A \"certified\" photocopy or other copy is one that bears either an  original signature of the registrar or other designated school officials or an  original impression of the institution's seal. Uncertified photocopies are not  acceptable. If these official documents are in a foreign language, they must be  accompanied by an official English translation.          In  addition, every applicant whose native language is not English must take the  Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English  Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE  Academic). Information concerning these examinations may be obtained by  visiting the website. Each student must request that his or her score on this  examination be sent to the NYU Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center, code  2562.          Applicants  residing in the New York area may elect to take the English proficiency test of  the University's American Language Institute, located at 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003. An appointment to take the test may be made by  calling 212-998-7040.          Financial  documentation is not required when filing an application. If the student is  accepted, instructions for completing the Application for Certificate of  Eligibility (AFCOE) online will be included in the acceptance packet.  Appropriate evidence of financial ability must be submitted with the AFCOE to  the Office for International Students and Scholars in order for the appropriate  visa document to be issued. If the applicant's studies are being financed by  means of his or her own savings, parental support, outside private or  government scholarships, or any combination of these, he or she must arrange to  send official letters or similar certification as proof of such support.          New  students may wish to view the multimedia tutorial for new international  students.              THE  AMERICAN LANGUAGE INSTITUTE      The American Language Institute of the School of  Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive  courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language.  It also offers the Advanced Workshop Program in English for students with  substantial English proficiency but insufficient proficiency for undertaking a  full-time academic program. Qualified students in this program can often  combine English study with a part-time academic program. This combination may  constitute a full-time program of study. The institute also offers specialized  courses in accent reduction, grammar, and American business English.          Individuals  who wish to obtain additional information about the American Language Institute  are invited to visit the office of the American Language Institute weekdays throughout  the year between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Fridays until 5 p.m.). They  may also visit the website; contact The American Language Institute, School of  Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003; telephone: 212-998-7040; fax: 212-995-4135; or  e-mail: ali@nyu.edu .              STUDENT  VISAS AND ORIENTATION      Matters  pertaining to student visas and new student orientation are administered by the  Office of Global Services (OGS), 561 La Guardia Place, 1st Floor; 212-998-4720.  In addition, the staff of this office endeavors to aid international students  in taking full advantage of various social, cultural, and recreational  opportunities offered by the University and the city. Specific information on  programs and events can be found at www.nyu.edu/oiss .              READMISSION  OF FORMER STUDENTS      Any  former student who has been out of attendance for more than two consecutive  terms and who wishes to return to the College must apply for readmission.  Applications for readmission are available online. (See admission application  filing deadlines above.) Requests for readmission should be received by April 1  for the summer and fall terms and November 1 for the spring term, but will be  considered after those deadlines on a space available basis.      Students  who have attended another college or university since their last attendance at  New York University must complete the regular application for transfer  admission and submit an official transcript.              SPECIAL  (POSTGRADUATE) STUDENTS      Graduates  of accredited four-year colleges, including the College of Arts and Science and  other schools of New York University, may register as special students in  undergraduate courses for which they meet the prerequisites and that are still  open after matriculated students have registered. Such a student should submit  proof of his or her degree and an application for admission as a special  postgraduate student. The application form can be obtained online.          Deadlines  for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      Students  interested in the post-baccalaureate premedical program should contact the  Preprofessional Center, College of Arts and Science, New York University,  Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901, New York, NY 10003-6688;  212-998-8160.              NYU  SPRING IN NEW YORK      NYU  Spring in New York offers college students from other institutions an opportunity  to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University.  Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in  courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.          In  addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to  the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports  center access, and program office events, including ticket discounts for  Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to  participate in planned excursions around the city.      The  program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at  an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a  competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing  in the academic year of participation.          Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/spring.in.ny .              NYU  JANUARY TERM      New  York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new  scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students  have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest.  During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the  foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as  have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of  year.          Oftentimes,  the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, considering a  full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship  commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new  academic interest or take advantage of the many  cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term  provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major,  minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree  completion, and to concentrate on personal interests.         Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter .              ADVANCED  STANDING      Credit  may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or  university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the  applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any,  advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere  is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the  content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere;  individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability  of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree  of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here.  Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses  were completed within the past 10 years.          Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits  transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at  face value to NYU.          As  with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the  residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following  residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of  course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of  graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU.          A  tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student  upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced  standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation.  Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester  during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter,  a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written  permission of the Office of the Dean.              CREDIT  BY EXAMINATION (INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MATURITY EXAMS)      The  Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the  International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign  maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive  credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in  college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the College's  degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College.          The  maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College  that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special  examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved)  shall not exceed a total of 32.          International  Baccalaureate (IB)      The  College recognizes, for advanced standing credit, higher-level examinations  passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard-level  examinations. Official reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate  Admissions Processing Center for review. See the chart below concerning those  IB test scores for which credit is given.         Maturity  Certificate Examinations          The College will consider the results of certain foreign  maturity certificate examinations for advanced standing credit. They are:      A Levels and Cambridge Pre-U     Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at     German Abitur     Italian Maturit\u00e0 Federal Swiss Maturity Certificate (Matura)      CAS  does not award credit for any other maturity certificate examinations.          Official  reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing  Center. These documents will be added to the student record, but advanced  standing credit for all examinations other than AP and IB will be awarded by  the College Advising Center, Silver 905; 212-998-8130.      See  the chart below for details on those A Level and Cambridge Pre-U test scores  for which credit is given. For the other maturity examinations, please note  that not every subject is awarded credit by the College. Creditworthy results  earn 8 points each (except for the Italian Maturit\u00e0, which is 4 points).          Minimum  scores for receiving credit are:      A Levels: B     Cambridge Pre-U: M2     CAPE: II (out of VII)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at: 12 (out of 20) with coefficient of 5 or better     German Abitur: 10 (out of 15). Credit is only awarded for written exams  (schr.), not for oral (mdl.)     Italian Maturit\u00e0: 7 (out of 10)     Swiss Matura: 4.5 (out of 6)              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT PROGRAM      The College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP)  Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accordance with New York  University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for  test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination. Students  receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding  college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See  the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The  chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equivalencies  are granted.          For  additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500.              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT CREDIT AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM      Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign  language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College also accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower likewise award no credit and have no bearing on placement.

Students  planning a major or minor in physics must consult with that department about  proper placement and possible counting of A Level/Pre-U credits towards  departmental requirements. Prehealth students should not use A Level/Pre-U  credits to place out of PHYS-UA 11, 12.      18 Majors and minors in psychology  can use four of the A Level/Pre-U credits to exempt from PSYCH-UA 1 and to  count as one of the ten courses required for the major or as one of the four  courses required for the minor. The other four points cannot be applied towards  psychology major or minor requirements.      19 A Level/Pre-U credits cannot be  counted towards the religious studies major or minor.      20 Sociology majors may request  departmental approval for counting four of the eight A Level/Pre-U credits  toward the major as one of the three required SOC-UA electives. However, the  credits never exempt students from any of the introductory courses in Sociology  (SOC-UA 1, 2, 3).

If you recently transferred to Gallatin, the information on this page will help guide you as you transition into the school and begin your career as a Gallatin student. Prospective transfer students should refer to the FAQs for information regarding the admission process, important deadlines, and the structure of advising at Gallatin.                               Murals by the artist Peter Halley on permanent display at the Gallatin School.           Preparing for your transfer   Whether you are already an NYU student or currently attending an external institution, the decision to transfer to Gallatin is a very serious one. When you transfer to Gallatin, you take on a completely different set of degree requirements, gain a new faculty adviser and new student colleagues, and adopt Gallatin's unique educational philosophy. As you prepare for your transfer, we recommend that you think carefully about your educational goals and how a liberal arts education at Gallatin can help you achieve them. This means both researching the Gallatin degree requirements and curriculum and thinking realistically about how you might develop your individualized concentration as a Gallatin student. These FAQs aim to guide you as you prepare for your transfer.                                                  I just learned about Gallatin. How can I find out more about the school? Can you tell me how Gallatin works?                                 The best way to find out more about Gallatin is to attend an information session.   If you have attended an info session and have additional questions, you may meet with an adviser on Fridays (during the academic year) between 10:00 and 12:00. These walk-in hours are held at the Academic Resource Center, 18 Washington Place. Because of the volume of students interested in Gallatin, we ask that you first attend an info session before meeting with an adviser.                                                              When am I eligible to transfer?                                 If you are currently a student in another NYU school or college, you must be in at least your second semester of consecutive full-time study at your current program to be eligible for an internal transfer. Because Gallatin allows students to transfer a maximum of 64 earned units, both internal and external transfer students should plan to start at Gallatin no later than the first semester of their junior year.   Transfer students to Gallatin who have completed more than 64 credits (AP and IB credit included) at their previous school(s) prior to matriculation at Gallatin will see a reduction in their cumulative earned hours (EHRS on the transcript) down to 64 credits once Gallatin has updated their records. This policy is stated in our admissions materials : transfer students will be eligible to receive a maximum of 64 credits of advanced standing upon their matriculation at Gallatin. The Gallatin faculty has determined that 64 credits in residence at Gallatin, under the guidance and mentoring of a Gallatin adviser, are the minimum amount of course work and time required for students to develop a proper concentration and establish an individualized program. This does not mean that you must complete 64 more credits in only Gallatin courses, but that you must complete a minimum of 64 credits at NYU under the supervision of your Gallatin adviser.                                                              How do I apply to transfer? Can you tell me what is required for the transfer application?                                 The application process (including decisions) is handled by NYU's main Office of Admissions Feel free to contact them directly with questions about applying.                                                              When is the transfer application due? When will I receive a decision?                                 For information on application deadlines, refer to Key Dates and Deadlines on the Admissions Office page. Please note that transfer applications are reviewed by NYU's Office of Admissions; Gallatin advisers do not participate in admission decisions.                                                                Does Gallatin have requirements?                                 Yes. You can learn more about the Gallatin degree requirements here .                                                                  Can you tell me if my previous coursework will fulfill Gallatin degree   requirements?                                 If you are applying to transfer to Gallatin from another school within NYU, your previous coursework may satisfy Gallatin's degree requirements.     If you are applying from an external institution, NYU's Office of Admissions will post your credits during your first semester. At that point, the transfer student adviser will review your transfer credits and make sure they are appropriately satisfying Gallatin's degree requirements.                                                                Can I study away if I transfer to Gallatin?                                 Yes. Although you must be in New York during your first semester at Gallatin, you can still study away in later semesters.                                                              Can transfer students to Gallatin do internships?                               Yes. You can find information about Gallatin internships, including the proposal form to submit to your adviser, here. If you would like to register an internship for credit in the summer before starting at Gallatin, you may submit the proposal form to the transfer student adviser.   Students in other NYU schools who are interested in Gallatin internships should first contact their home school adviser.                                                                Can I meet with a Gallatin adviser before I transfer? Can you tell me what courses I should take before I transfer?                                 Because advisers at Gallatin must prioritize meeting with current Gallatin students, it is not possible for all prospective transfer students to meet with a Gallatin adviser before matriculation. We encourage you to discuss your plans to transfer an adviser in your current school. If you have attended a Gallatin info session and studied the information on the Gallatin website, and then still have additional questions, Gallatin's transfer student adviser holds walk-in hours for prospective transfer students on Fridays from 10:00 to 12:00 in the Academic Resource Center, 18 Washington Place. Be aware that transfer applications are reviewed by NYU's Office of Admissions; Gallatin advisers do not participate in admission decisions.   Gallatin is a school of individualized study; therefore the &quot;prereqs&quot; you take before applying will vary depending on your course of study. There is no particular set of courses that are recommended or required before transferring.                                                                Will my financial aid be affected by transferring to Gallatin?                                 Because each student has a unique financial situation, all questions regarding Financial Aid should be addressed to the Financial Aid Office.                                                                I want to study ________. Can I do that Gallatin?                                 There is no easy answer to this question, but there are a few steps you can take so that you can get a better sense of whether what you want to study is feasible. First, look over the Gallatin degree requirements and figure out what requirements you have already fulfilled. Then begin drafting what your next several semesters at NYU might look like. Keep your remaining degree requirements in mind as you research the courses you would like to take at Gallatin and at the other schools within NYU. Are the kinds of courses you want to take offered at NYU? Do you have enough semesters remaining to reach the level you want? What prerequisites do you need? If you plan to study abroad, when will this fit into your plan of study? Will you incorporate an internship into your schedule? These are just some of the questions you should be asking yourself as you map out your trajectory as a Gallatin student.                                                              I've just been admitted to Gallatin. When can I get started?                               Congratulations! Be sure to follow all the instructions in the acceptance message you received from the Office of Admissions. A Gallatin adviser will directly contact you just as soon as your record is updated.                        Gallatin-Bound LS Core Students   As an LS Core student, you may be in the unique position of knowing that you want to transfer to Gallatin as early as the first semester of your first year. Stay in regular contact with your LS adviser and make sure that he or she knows of your plans to transfer to Gallatin. The information below will help you to understand how your LS courses will fulfill some of the Gallatin degree requirements.   Undergraduate Core Requirement     First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar: waived for LS Core students   First-Year Writing Seminar: Satisfied by LS Writing I WRI-UF 101   First-Year Research Seminar: Satisfied by LS Writing II WRI-UF 102   Gallatin Interdisciplinary Seminars (16 units required): Gallatin Interdisciplinary Seminar (IDSEM-UG) courses taken prior to matriculation at Gallatin will count toward this requirement.   Other Gallatin credits (16 units required): Gallatin Advanced Writing Courses (WRTNG-UG), Arts Workshops (ARTS-UG), Community Learning (CLI-UG), internships, and other Gallatin courses taken prior to matriculation in Gallatin will count toward this requirement.     Foundation Requirement     Humanities (8 units required): Satisfied by LS Core (CFI-UF 101, CFII-UF 102).   Social Science (8 units required): Satisfied by LS Core (SFI-UF 101, SFII-UF 102).   Math/Science (4 units required): Satisfied by math/science courses (not AP credits).   Global Cultures (4 units required): Satisfied by LS Core courses.   Pre-Modern (4 units required): approved Gallatin and CAS courses taken before or after matriculation at Gallatin will count toward this requirement     Early Modern (4 units required): approved Gallatin and CAS courses taken before or after matriculation at Gallatin will count toward this requirement.     Other Requirements     Total Units Required to Graduate: 128 units.   Academic Good Standing: minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0.   Residency Requirement: The last 32 units must be completed at NYU (either at the Washington Square campus or at one of NYU\u2019s study away sites).   Transfer Units: The Gallatin faculty has determined that 64 units in residence at Gallatin (taken over the course of two years) under the guidance and mentoring of a Gallatin adviser is the minimum amount of course work and time required for students to develop a proper concentration and establish an individualized program. Therefore, transfer students to the Gallatin School will be eligible to transfer a maximum of 64 units upon their matriculation at Gallatin. To fulfill Gallatin\u2019s degree requirements, all students must complete a minimum of 64 credits while matriculated at Gallatin.   Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration: students who transfer with 64 or more earned units must complete this requirement in conversation with their primary faculty advisers in the first semester at Gallatin.   Colloquium: All Gallatin students must complete this requirement during their senior year.              Your first semester at Gallatin     We are excited that you have decided that Gallatin is the right school for you. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of your first semester here.     Primary Faculty Adviser       Just before the start of your first semester, you will be paired with a primary faculty adviser based on your responses to the Gallatin Advising Questionnaire. We recommend that students meet with their primary faculty advisers regularly, at least 3-4 times per semester. As with any relationship, it takes time to get to know your adviser. If you speak to your adviser only once or twice, then he or she may not be able to give you the guidance and mentoring that is needed to develop your individualized concentration.     Class Advisers     While your primary faculty adviser will be your main intellectual mentor, you will also work closely with class advisers - initially the transfer student adviser, and the first-year, sophomore, junior, or senior class adviser once you've settled into Gallatin. Class advisers provide both additional academic support as well as help with policies and procedures.       The Gallatin and larger NYU communities       We encourage transfer students to become active members of Gallatin and NYU. As a small liberal arts school within a large university, Gallatin offers distinct Student Life activities. It is easy to get involved and to meet other Gallatin students who share your interests. NYU also has a Transfer and Transitioning Students Services Office .
