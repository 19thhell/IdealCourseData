But how does this city affect an artist and how does an artist affect a city? The summer program in Paris explores the daily culture and more urban forms of art in Paris. Students are exposed to the key concepts and fundamental theories of urban studies, public art and the urban-inspired works of many great artists and writers based in Paris. Themes of urban art are analyzed to expose the artists\u2019 intentions, message, and impact on daily life. In addition to daily studies of a variety of art forms, students will capture their experience of Parisian urban arts through a series of documentary video production exercises.
