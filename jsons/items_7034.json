Description       Takeshi Kitano, aka Beat Takeshi, is probably the most famous contemporary Japanese actor, filmmaker, and personality. This course will take up the issue of a continuum, or a \u201cthin blue line,\u201d between male homosociality and homosexuality as theorized by Eve Sedgwick in her\u00a0 Between Men \u00a0, by exploring the role of desire in male friendship, male love and homophobia in the context of three Kitano films:\u00a0 Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence \u00a0,\u00a0 Sonatine \u00a0, and\u00a0 Taboo \u00a0. We will be attentive to how male friendships are protected from, or conversely, directly confront homoeroticism, as well as to how women figure as objects between men. We will consider other issues in relation to the specific historical contexts of the three films: (1) colonialism, wartime ethics, and racial politics for\u00a0 Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence \u00a0; (2) Yakuza characters as film tropes and Okinawan-Japanese ethnic politics for\u00a0 Sonatine \u00a0; and (3) the politics of male-male relations in samurai culture for\u00a0 Taboo \u00a0. Readings may include the following: selections from Eve Sedgwick,\u00a0 Between Men \u00a0and\u00a0 Epistemology of the Closet, \u00a0Gregory Pflugfelder,\u00a0 Cartographies of Desire \u00a0, Lydia N.

Description       Takeshi Kitano, aka Beat Takeshi, is probably the most famous contemporary Japanese actor, filmmaker, and personality. This course will take up the issue of a continuum, or a \u201cthin blue line,\u201d between male homosociality and homosexuality as theorized by Eve Sedgwick in her\u00a0 Between Men \u00a0, by exploring the role of desire in male friendship, male love and homophobia in the context of three Kitano films:\u00a0 Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence \u00a0,\u00a0 Sonatine \u00a0, and\u00a0 Taboo \u00a0. We will be attentive to how male friendships are protected from, or conversely, directly confront homoeroticism, as well as to how women figure as objects between men. We will consider other issues in relation to the specific historical contexts of the three films: (1) colonialism, wartime ethics, and racial politics for\u00a0 Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence \u00a0; (2) Yakuza characters as film tropes and Okinawan-Japanese ethnic politics for\u00a0 Sonatine \u00a0; and (3) the politics of male-male relations in samurai culture for\u00a0 Taboo \u00a0. Readings may include the following: selections from Eve Sedgwick,\u00a0 Between Men \u00a0and\u00a0 Epistemology of the Closet, \u00a0Gregory Pflugfelder,\u00a0 Cartographies of Desire \u00a0, Lydia N.

This 2-unit course is taken after the student has completed a Proseminar and generally during the second semester of full-time study, or after completing 12 credits. This course is only offered in the Spring semester. Full-time students admitted in the spring term will need to take the Thesis Proposal Seminar in their third semester. Section 1 is for students who intend to complete a thesis drawing largely from research in the fields of the humanities. Please note that, throughout the semester, all sections of this course will occasionally meet together at the regular class time; this includes the first day of classes, Tuesday, January 28th, in which all sections meet at 1 Washington Place, Room 527.
