They let us chat via web cams, send e-mails from cell phones, and withdraw cash from ATMs. But computer-based devices and information networks aren&rsquo;t the only products computer engineers develop; they reconstruct genomes, design robots, and develop software to make businesses more efficient. That&rsquo;s just the kind of invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship that the School of Engineering encourages.   Our BS program in Computer Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET ( www.abet.org ). The program has a comprehensive analysis and design curriculum that provides an outstanding, cutting-edge education in computer systems with emphasis on hardware and software, The program incorporates the latest market and technology trends and combines the traditional disciplines of electronics, communications, control and computer programming with newer courses, such as Cyber Security, Nanoscale Circuit Design, Parallel Computers, Image Processing, Biomedical Instrumentation, Web Search Engines, Wireless Networks, Peer-to-Peer Networks, SoC (System-on-a-Chip), VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) and Game Development.   Recognizing the need for well-rounded engineers, we also emphasize strong communication and interpersonal skills. Our students develop these skills not only through required courses in the humanities and social sciences but also during team projects in design classes. Sponsored research and affiliate programs at our Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications (CATT), and Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) Lab also put you in constant contact with alumni and instructors whose experience in the industry you can draw upon.   Graduates of our program have gone on to design microchips and computer graphics, monitor and control industrial plants, and develop embedded hardware/software systems. They also occupy positions in manufacturing, research, financial services, health, and government, or create their own companies.   With departmental permission, you may earn a single bachelor&rsquo;s degree in electrical and computer engineering. This degree requires a minimum of 142 credits rather than the typical 128 required for individual bachelor&rsquo;s degrees.

They let us chat via web cams, send e-mails from cell phones, and withdraw cash from ATMs. But computer-based devices and information networks aren&rsquo;t the only products computer engineers develop; they reconstruct genomes, design robots, and develop software to make businesses more efficient. That&rsquo;s just the kind of invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship that the School of Engineering encourages.   Our BS program in Computer Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET ( www.abet.org ). The program has a comprehensive analysis and design curriculum that provides an outstanding, cutting-edge education in computer systems with emphasis on hardware and software, The program incorporates the latest market and technology trends and combines the traditional disciplines of electronics, communications, control and computer programming with newer courses, such as Cyber Security, Nanoscale Circuit Design, Parallel Computers, Image Processing, Biomedical Instrumentation, Web Search Engines, Wireless Networks, Peer-to-Peer Networks, SoC (System-on-a-Chip), VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) and Game Development.   Recognizing the need for well-rounded engineers, we also emphasize strong communication and interpersonal skills. Our students develop these skills not only through required courses in the humanities and social sciences but also during team projects in design classes. Sponsored research and affiliate programs at our Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications (CATT), and Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) Lab also put you in constant contact with alumni and instructors whose experience in the industry you can draw upon.   Graduates of our program have gone on to design microchips and computer graphics, monitor and control industrial plants, and develop embedded hardware/software systems. They also occupy positions in manufacturing, research, financial services, health, and government, or create their own companies.
