Written originally in Japanese, a collection of Tawada\u2019s stories  and poetry was translated into German and made an appearance soon after in 1987  under the title Nur da wo du bist da ist  nichts ( Only there where you  are there is nothing ). Since then, Tawada has published numerous stories, poetry,  essays, plays both in Japanese and in German and has established a celebrated  career as a contemporary literature author where she is widely noted for her  intercultural style of writing for which she has experienced an exceptional  amount of attention.  Tawada has appeared in over 800 different publications in  several countries since 1987. Among these publications are her novella Inu  mukoiri ( The Bridegroom Was a Dog , 1991;  translated 1998), which was awarded the Akutagawa Prize in 1993, and Yogisha  no yako ressha ( Suspects on  the Night Train ), a series of linked stories, which also received the  Tanizaki Junichiro Prize in 2003.          In addition to her many Japanese literary awards, Tawada is the  recipient of numerous prestigious German literary awards, including the Advancement  in Literature Prize (1990), the Lessing Prize (1993), the Adelbert von Chamisso  Prize (1996), and the Goethe Medal (2005). She has also been a writer in  residence at several universities across the U.S., including Washington  University (2007), Stanford University (2008), and Cornell University (2008).          In  her concise and concentrated texts, which seldom oscillate between poetic,  essay-like, and treaty-like forms of writing, Tawada also focuses mainly on the  exploration of the possibilities and borders of language. Through unusual word  structures and sentence structures, conventional meanings and typically  well-known connotations transform into foreign or even resistive figures, which  demand renewed interpretations of those meanings. Tawada\u2019s literature is  frequently described as an interview of language as well as a creative word  play on styles, sound forms, and complex meanings that serve as new  understandings of language creations. Unlike any other contemporary literature  author, Tawada also redesigns the conception of intercultural poetry with her  poetic style of writing.  Yoko Tawada relocated to Berlin, Germany in 2006 and still resides there as a freelance writer.

One can encounter this past not just in the city's many museums and in the memories of its inhabitants, but also in its architecture: the palaces of the baroque, rococo and romantic periods, the monumental government buildings and workers' tenements of the Wilhelminian Empire, the modernist structures of the Weimar Republic, the massive ministries and Olympic Stadium of the Third Reich, ruins from World War II, the showcase developments-and the Wall-constructed during the Cold War.   Today, Berlin is at a particularly exciting moment of transition, reclaiming its historical role as Germany's capital and as the political, cultural, and economic intermediary between Eastern and Western Europe. Massive construction projects reflect this development and offer some of the most exciting new architecture in the world. Berlin is a thoroughly modern but affordable city with outstanding museums and a lively theatre and music scene; it also has an efficient public transportation system, an international cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife.            ACADEMICS      The academic program, built around Berlin's rich culture, immerses students in the life and language of the city. For those interested in language study, Summer in Berlin offers German courses at all levels of instruction, based on sufficient enrollment per course. In addition, content courses provide students with the option of exploring through walking tours and site trips both the historical past and exciting present of Germany\u2019s capital, of delving into the city\u2019s exciting interwar art scene, or of gaining a uniquely German perspective on terrorism.   Study of German language is recommended, but not required. Students can choose to take two content courses taught in English. An Independent Study course permits students, if they so desire, to engage in a research project or learning experience of their own design.                HOUSING &amp; MEALS     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Housing is located in NYU\u2019s newly opened residence in Kreuzberg, just around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie in an emerging art scene neighborhood studded with galleries. The NYU in Berlin academic center in the KulturBrauerei is a converted former brewery complex in the district of Prenzlauer Berg. It is a multi-story building featuring classrooms, offices, art studio space, a lounge and a computer lab.            EXCURSIONS     Aside from excursions in and around the city of Berlin, students will take a day trip to Weimar and Leipzig, and a weekend trip to Prague. In Prague, students will explore the traces of three cultures-Czech, German, and Jewish-on a three-day weekend.             Courses     All students must register for 8 points.

(Taught in German) Taught by: Yoko Tawada, DAAD Chair in Contemporary Poetics at NYU &amp; Eckart Goebel Spring 2015 - Wednesdays: 3:30 - 6:10PM           Born in Tokyo, Japan in 1960, Yoko Tawada first traveled to  Germany at the age of 19 where she established permanence residency in Hamburg  three years later. Written originally in Japanese, a collection of Tawada\u2019s stories  and poetry was translated into German and made an appearance soon after in 1987  under the title Nur da wo du bist da ist  nichts ( Only there where you  are there is nothing ). Since then, Tawada has published numerous stories, poetry,  essays, plays both in Japanese and in German and has established a celebrated  career as a contemporary literature author where she is widely noted for her  intercultural style of writing for which she has experienced an exceptional  amount of attention.  Tawada has appeared in over 800 different publications in  several countries since 1987. Among these publications are her novella Inu  mukoiri ( The Bridegroom Was a Dog , 1991;  translated 1998), which was awarded the Akutagawa Prize in 1993, and Yogisha  no yako ressha ( Suspects on  the Night Train ), a series of linked stories, which also received the  Tanizaki Junichiro Prize in 2003.          In addition to her many Japanese literary awards, Tawada is the  recipient of numerous prestigious German literary awards, including the Advancement  in Literature Prize (1990), the Lessing Prize (1993), the Adelbert von Chamisso  Prize (1996), and the Goethe Medal (2005). She has also been a writer in  residence at several universities across the U.S., including Washington  University (2007), Stanford University (2008), and Cornell University (2008).          In  her concise and concentrated texts, which seldom oscillate between poetic,  essay-like, and treaty-like forms of writing, Tawada also focuses mainly on the  exploration of the possibilities and borders of language. Through unusual word  structures and sentence structures, conventional meanings and typically  well-known connotations transform into foreign or even resistive figures, which  demand renewed interpretations of those meanings. Tawada\u2019s literature is  frequently described as an interview of language as well as a creative word  play on styles, sound forms, and complex meanings that serve as new  understandings of language creations. Unlike any other contemporary literature  author, Tawada also redesigns the conception of intercultural poetry with her  poetic style of writing.  Yoko Tawada relocated to Berlin, Germany in 2006 and still resides there as a freelance writer.

Two collections of stories also  garnered acclaim: Mutterzunge (1990,  Rotbuch) and Der Hof im Spiegel (2001,  KiWi).     \u00d6zdamar is  the recipient of many major German literary awards, including the Ingeborg  Bachmann Prize (1991), Walter Hasenclever Prize (1993), Adalbert von Chamisso Prize (1999), Heinrich  Kleist Prize (2004), Berlin Art Prize for Literature (2009), Carl Zuckmayer  Medal (2010), and the Alice Salomon Poetics Prize (2011).

One can encounter this past not just in the city's many museums and in the memories of its inhabitants, but also in its architecture: the palaces of the baroque, rococo and romantic periods, the monumental government buildings and workers' tenements of the Wilhelminian Empire, the modernist structures of the Weimar Republic, the massive ministries and Olympic Stadium of the Third Reich, ruins from World War II, the showcase developments-and the Wall-constructed during the Cold War.   Today, Berlin is at a particularly exciting moment of transition, reclaiming its historical role as Germany's capital and as the political, cultural, and economic intermediary between Eastern and Western Europe. Massive construction projects reflect this development and offer some of the most exciting new architecture in the world. Berlin is a thoroughly modern but affordable city with outstanding museums and a lively theatre and music scene; it also has an efficient public transportation system, an international cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife.            ACADEMICS      The academic program, built around Berlin's rich culture, immerses students in the life and language of the city. For those interested in language study, Summer in Berlin offers German courses at all levels of instruction, based on sufficient enrollment per course. In addition, content courses provide students with the option of exploring through walking tours and site trips both the historical past and exciting present of Germany\u2019s capital, of delving into the city\u2019s exciting interwar art scene, or of gaining a uniquely German perspective on terrorism.   Study of German language is recommended, but not required. Students can choose to take two content courses taught in English. An Independent Study course permits students, if they so desire, to engage in a research project or learning experience of their own design.                HOUSING &amp; MEALS     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Housing is located in NYU\u2019s newly opened residence in Kreuzberg, just around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie in an emerging art scene neighborhood studded with galleries. The NYU in Berlin academic center in the KulturBrauerei is a converted former brewery complex in the district of Prenzlauer Berg. It is a multi-story building featuring classrooms, offices, art studio space, a lounge and a computer lab.            EXCURSIONS     Aside from excursions in and around the city of Berlin, students will take a day trip to Weimar and Leipzig, and a weekend trip to Prague. In Prague, students will explore the traces of three cultures-Czech, German, and Jewish-on a three-day weekend.             Courses     All students must register for 8 points.

NYU financial aid can be applied to the costs of living and studying at any of these exchange institutions, and NYU academic credit is awarded directly for courses taken. Students may study abroad for one semester or a full year, usually in the junior year, with the approval of the major department(s) and the assistant dean for international study. The minimum requirement for any of the exchange programs is successful completion of 64 points of undergraduate course work and a 3.0 GPA. Both programs in Berlin require proficiency in German; the programs in Bonn and Vienna offer some courses in English.  NYU in Berlin (Fall and Spring Semester Program) NYU in Berlin is a semester- or year-long study abroad program based at the prestigious Humboldt University, located in the heart of the city. Course offerings focus on the society, politics, history, and culture of Germany, as well as contemporary Western Europe. The program features NYU courses, taught by NYU faculty, members of the Humboldt faculty, and Berlin\u2019s wider academic community. The program is designed for students of German, as well as history and the social sciences. All content courses, taught in English, will either count for credit in the department in which they are listed or toward the three courses in English as part of the German Literature and Culture major. At least one course must be taken in German. For more information on NYU in Berlin (Fall and Spring Semester Program) click here.    NYU in Berlin (Summer Program) The department offers a six-week summer program in Berlin. The program consists of language courses and culture courses (in English), which may be applied to the major or minor. For more information on NYU in Berlin (Summer Program) click here.    Graduate    In 2009 a exchange program for graduate students was established between the German Department at NYU and the Deutsches Seminar of the University of Zurich , financed independently from graduate student MacCracken stipends. Through the current exchange, one student from NYU is able to join the Zurich Department in Fall, while one student from Zurich is sent in exchange. In addition, the German Department at NYU participates in another exchange program, sending graduate students from NYU to Free University Berlin for either one term or an entire academic year. The Department strongly supports all Graduate Students applying for other exchange stipends such as those offered by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).
