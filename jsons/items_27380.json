When was the last time you bought a book of poems?   For some, the very idea of poetry is intimidating\u2014it\u2019s the stuff of forgotten lectures and the sort of tweedy, genteel chatter that\u2019s studded with obscure references you\u2019d need a couple of PhDs to untangle. Yet in this modern landscape, verse might just be more prevalent and accessible than ever\u2014in hip-hop music and spoken word performance, in the hyper-condensed witticisms native to social media, and, as always, at inaugurations, funerals, and in the other formal ceremonies marking major milestones in our lives.                                 Such occasions figure prominently in NYU creative writing director Deborah Landau\u2019s new poetry collection The Uses of the Body\u2014a haunting exploration of marriage, motherhood, and growing older that O Magazine dubbed \u201ca thrilling meditation on the passages of life\u201d and Vogue compared to \u201cRichard Linklater\u2019s Boyhood, but for girls (and women).\u201d In it Landau mines the everyday\u2014a doctor\u2019s visit, a night spent pacing the halls with a newborn baby, a tipsy wedding toast\u2014for the powerful feelings of contentment, dread, and longing that can sometimes seize us at the most unexpected moments. If you\u2019re looking for a way back in to poetry that won\u2019t put you in a cold sweat over flashbacks to your high school AP English exam, this might be it.   This April, for National Poetry Month , NYU Stories asked Landau to take stock of the art today, and to recommend 15 poems (5 old, 5 newer, and 5 newest) for those of us who aspire to read more verse but never quite know where to start.

I imagine most people don\u2019t read much poetry beyond what they were taught in school\u2014perhaps Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost.   Much has been written about how memorization of poetry is no longer required in most schools. What do you make of that change?  While it\u2019s wonderful to have poems in one\u2019s head, obligatory rote memorization may have turned some people off of poetry in the same way that memorizing facts for a history exam doesn\u2019t necessarily help one grasp or appreciate the nuances of a historical moment.   I think the best approach to teaching poetry is one that helps readers understand that poetry is a vital art form, and that poems can be relevant in an immediate way to the living of one\u2019s life. Brett Laurer and Lynn Melnick have edited a fantastic new anthology called Please Excuse This Poem: 100 New Poets for the Next Generation , which contains a vibrant array of younger contemporary poets on subjects ranging from love to loss to addiction. This book will appeal to younger people in a way that being required to memorize a sonnet about a flower might not.   Did you memorize poems?  My Chaucer professor required us to memorize the opening passage of The Canterbury Tales , which he insisted would come in handy at cocktail parties. It hasn\u2019t, but I do like having those distinctive and musical lines in my head.   Is there a place for poetry in mainstream society today? Your book recommended on the pages of O Magazine and Vogue would seem to indicate that there\u2019s a sizable audience for this kind of work.  Yes, it was surprising and nice to be included in those more mainstream venues and my new book does seem to have more crossover appeal, perhaps because it takes on subject matter\u2014desire, marriage, pregnancy, motherhood, growing older\u2014that isn\u2019t so esoteric. Twelve thousand people attended this year\u2019s Association of Writers &amp; Writing Programs conference in Minneapolis, many of them poets. That seems a strong indicator of the popularity of poetry, and of course there are poetry readings proliferating everywhere\u2014from the large formal series such as those run by the Poetry Society of America and the 92nd Street Y to the informal gatherings in coffee shops and bookstores and libraries that happen throughout the country.   How has technology changed how poetry is created and received?  Technology makes poetry much more accessible in many ways\u2014the Poetry Foundation, for example, has just launched a new initiative, PoetryNow, in which poetry is published on the Foundation\u2019s website and syndicated for radio distribution through WFMT Radio Network. The Academy of American Poets gets poetry out to thousands of people every day through its Poem-A-Day series, which sends a daily poem to subscribers by e-mail. I have an app on my iPhone from the Poetry Foundation that contains thousands of poems with a push of a button\u2014so there\u2019s always a poem in your pocket!\u2014and of course a nearly unlimited number of volumes of poetry can be carried everywhere on a kindle app.   Are tweets poems?  Tweets require lively, energetic use of language, and compression\u2014all features of poetic language. And I suppose it would be possible to send a poem as a tweet or series of tweets. Some poets are exceedingly witty and popular on Twitter\u2014 Patricia Lockwood comes to mind. She has more than 50,000 followers.   Why do you think people like to read poems at weddings, or when somebody dies?  Poetry is a repository for intense emotion, and people turn to poems when feelings are so overpowering that articulation is difficult. The perfect poem can be a great and essential comfort and/or pleasure on such occasions.   Are there ideas or images you find yourself returning to again and again in your work?  Love and death seem to be the recurring themes.   Many people seem to associate poetry (and famous poets, especially if they led unhappy lives) with grief and darkness. Can you recommend some joyful poems?  There are so many, but here are some that immediately come to mind:   \u201cWhat Is,\u201d by Jeffrey Yang  \u201cCrazy About Her Shrimp\u201d by Charles Simic  \u201cThe Undertaking\u201d by Louise Gluck  \u201cblessing the boats\u201d by Lucile Clifton  \u201cAfter Making Love We Hear Footsteps,\u201d by Galway Kinnell  \u201cSong of Myself,\u201d by Walt Whitman  \u201cPoem\u201d (\u201cWhen I am feeling depressed\u2026\u201d) by Frank O\u2019Hara  \u201cPoem\u201d (\u201cLight clarity avocado salad in the morning\u201d) by Frank O\u2019Hara  \u201cCome Slowly \u2013 Eden!\u201d by Emily Dickinson   Reading your poems, I feel as though I know you, though of course I don't! Do you think we're more likely to experience that feeling of intimacy with poetry than with prose?  Poetry can provide a sort of central line into the interior life, more so than perhaps any other art form\u2014and there\u2019s a certain level of directness or honesty in my poems, of course\u2014but I\u2019d hope that in my work personal experience is distilled or transformed to some extent, through language, so that the reader is receiving a made thing, which is more than just a transcription or journal.   What are you tired of hearing people say when you tell them you're a poet?  It\u2019s a great conversation stopper as you might imagine! I try to avoid saying that I\u2019m a poet if I can.   What were the first poems you loved?  When I was 13 my mother gave me a book of Anne Sexton\u2019s Love Poems . It was a heady and intense book for a kid. I was hooked.                ***   For NYU Stories readers, Deborah Landau recommends:   5 old:   \u201cTo Autumn\u201d by John Keats   \u201cTo His Coy Mistress\u201d by Andrew Marvell   \u201cA Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\u201d by John Donne   \u201cI dwell in Possibility\u201d by Emily Dickinson   \u201cCrossing Brooklyn Ferry\u201d by Walt Whitman   5 newer:   \u201cThe Negro Speaks of Rivers\u201d by Langston Hughes   \u201cSunday Morning\u201d by Wallace Stevens   \u201cOne Art\u201d by Elizabeth Bishop   \u201cSoonest Mended\u201d by John Ashbery   \u201cThe Glass Essay\u201d by Anne Carson   5 newest:   \u201cCome on All You Ghosts\u201d by Matthew Zapruder   \u201cOur Andromeda\u201d by Brenda Shaughnessy   \u201cHow to Draw a Perfect Circle\u201d by Terrance Hayes   \u201cI Go Back to May 1937\u201d by Sharon Olds   \u201cFacing It\u201d by Yusef Komunyakaa           ***     Read Landau\u2019s poem \u201cI Don\u2019t Have a Pill for That\u201d in the NYU Arts Digest .
