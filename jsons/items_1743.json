Congratulations! Follow these steps to learn how to get your F-1 or J-1 visa and enter the U.S. in student status.                                                                                                       Watch our YouTube video on Coming to the U.S. to see an overview of the process!                                      Step 1: Receive your admission letter (or electronic version) from NYU.   To be eligible for NYU sponsorship of F-1 or J-1 student status, you need to be accepted to a full-time academic program at NYU and have an official admission notice from NYU along with an NYU University ID number. You are not eligible for NYU sponsorship if your program of study consists of only online courses. If you are not yet admitted to NYU and have questions about how to apply, please visit NYU Admissions .            Step 2: Activate your NYU NetID and NYU Email.     If you don\u2019t already know your NetID, learn your NYU NetID .   If you already know your NetID, go to start.nyu.edu to activate it.   Enter your NetID and click the \u201cStart!\u201d button.              Step 3: Decide if you will apply for F-1 or J-1 status.   In order to study at NYU, you will need to obtain a student status for the U.S. NYU sponsors international students for either F-1 or J-1 student status. Read about your options below and decide which status works best for you.                                                    What is F-1?                               F-1 status is the most common type of status used to study in the United States. F-1 status is for full-time academic and language students who are pursuing a degree or certificate. If you decide on F-1 status, you will need to apply for an I-20.   If you plan to bring your spouse with you, he or she will need to obtain a F-2 dependent I-20 from NYU. F-2 dependents may not work in the U.S. and may not enroll in school.                                                                What is J-1?                               In order to be a J-1 student at NYU, at least half of your funding must come from a source other than personal or family funds. If you decide on J-1 status, you will need to apply for a DS-2019.   If you plan to bring your spouse with you, he or she will need to get a J-2 dependent DS-2019 from NYU. Please note that J-2 dependents may apply for work permission and may study in the U.S.                          Step 4: Pay tuition deposit to the NYU Admissions Office for school you will attend.              Step 5: Complete your I-20 or DS-2019 Application   The I-20/DS-2019 Application is interactive and fillable online.       Complete it online, print it, sign it, then scan it.     Application Checklist:     A signed copy of your completed I-20/DS-2019 Application   A copy of your NYU admission letter (an electronic version is fine)   A copy of the photo page of your passport   Financial documents that prove you can pay for the estimated expenses at NYU. To see the amount of money you will need to show for one year of your academic program visit this estimated expenses page. You must be able to pay for your tuition, fees, health insurance, and living expenses while at NYU.   You need to show proof that you can pay for the first year\u2019s expenses.

A personal loan: a pre-approval letter confirming amount for which the loan is approved. A loan application is not sufficient.   An individual sponsor: the OGS Affidavit of Support plus a bank statement and/or letter from employer confirming annual salary and sponsor's position. (The sponsor's annual salary should be at least 3 times the amount of money they are providing to the student).   If you will be staying somewhere where you will receive free room and board: you need to provide a letter from who you are staying with indicating the amount of support they will provide for you and the duration of time you will stay with them. The value of room and board is estimated to be $10,000 per year.

The I-20 (for F-1 students)/DS-2019 (for J-1 students) is the document you need from NYU in order to apply for the F-1 or J-1 visa. You also need to present your I-20 or DS-2019 at the U.S. border along with your F-1 or J-1 visa and other supporting documents in order to be able to enter the U.S. as an F-1 or J-1 student.

How long does it normally take to get an I-20/DS-2019 from NYU once I apply?                                                       Processing time is about two weeks once we receive your complete application.                                                                                                                                                                        Do F-1 and J-1 students need health insurance to study at NYU?                                                       J-1 students are required by law to carry adequate levels of health insurance; failure to do so results in termination from the Exchange Visitor program.   You will also receive information about the insurance requirements with your initial DS-2019 form. When all international students register for classes, they will be automatically charged for the NYU-sponsored comprehensive insurance plan which is $3,439 annually. Check your bursar bill for insurance charges. You can apply to downgrade to the basic plan or waive the NYU insurance prior to the semester deadline. You can find detailed information on the NYU Health Insurance Website and should view the International Students section for important information.

What happens if my visa is denied?                                                       If you receive a visa denial, request a denial letter from the U.S. Consulate so that you will understand why your visa was denied. The main reason visas are denied for the U.S. is failure of the applicant to prove they have ties to their home country.

What happens if my visa is delayed?                                                       Some students may face visa delays due to security checks based on your field of study, name check or country of birth, citizenship, or nationality. Most security checks are handled within 30 days. If yours takes longer, email newinternationalstudents@nyu.edu with the details of the date and city of your visa application.
