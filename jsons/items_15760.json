Google Scholar is a time-saving, scholarly search interface accessible from within the Google interface. With Google Scholar, you can access peer-reviewed journal articles, books and book sections.

You can configure Google Scholar to:     Display a link to NYU options for the full-text of an article   Export your citations to RefWorks or EndNote     Here's how to display NYU links:     Open scholar.google.com   Go to the Settings icon (upper right screen)   Click on left menu item, \"Library Links\"   Type in: NYU   From the results, put a check mark next to \"New York University Libraries-GetIt at NYU\"   Click on Save to save preferences.

When using article databases, remember there are always three stages in your workflow (the \"three Ds\"):   1) Discovery: Do (and redo!) your searching, using varying terms and combining using the Boolean operators \" and, or, not \" to get good results. Your first search is not your best search, but rather an opportunity to learn how to immediately do a better search   2) Delivery: For items that you like, select the link to the fulltext if available, or click on the button to see if we own the item. If you want to keep this item, either save it to your own computer, email it to yourself, or print it.   3) Database it: Keep the \"meta-information\" about all that good resources you found for your records and to make your bibliographies. You will find yourself returning to resources so having a system in place will save you time and aggravation later. The NYU Libraries offer a number of tools to our users to help with this, in particular a tool called RefWorks , which you can learn about here.
