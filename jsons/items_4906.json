School of Law established.   1841: School of Medicine established.   1894: The undergraduate college moves to more spacious University Heights campus in the Bronx. Back at Washington Square, the University Building is demolished and construction begins on the Main Building, later renamed the Silver Center.   1917: The U.S. enters World War I, decreasing University enrollment and straining the budget. Chancellor Brown establishes branches of the Student Army Training Corps fulfilling the University's public responsibility during the war, and also helping save the school from financial ruin.   1929: The stock market crashes on Black Tuesday, starting the Great Depression. In the coming years, Chancellor Chase founded the Division of Continuing Education,the Center for Research and Graduate Studies and the School of Public Service in order to keep enrollment up despite the economic state.          1941: After the U.S. enters World War II, military training was established on campus. The War Placement Bureau was organized to assign many of technically trained faculty and staff to military and civilian agency positions. The University Heights campus became largely militarized while liberal arts and language training was offered for Army officers at Washington Square. Following the war, the University received the largest contingent of returning veterans in the nation, and enrollment rose back to its pre-war levels.   1968: Student activism becomes a major part of university life, as students engage in civil rights demonstrations at Washington Square Park. The late 60s and early 70s sees an unprecedented degree of student involvement with civil rights and anti-war movements. Students also start demand changes within the University, staging sit-ins, boycotts, and marches protesting tuition and dormitory rate increases.   1970: President Hester\u2019s administration embarked on a mission to raise $222.5 million in five years, the largest fund-raising effort ever undertaken by the University.   1973: University Heights campus is closed, with the University's main campus shifting back to Washington Square.   1976: The annual commencement ceremony is shifted from Madison Square Garden to Washington Square Park.   1985: President Brademas introduces the Billion Dollar Campaign, a landmark fund-raising plan to raise $1 billion by the year 2000.        1995: President Brademas's $1 billion fund-raising goal is met five years early.   2001: The September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center send shockwaves through the University, which had occupied several downtown buildings as dormitories in 1998.   2004: President Sexton announces two new fund-raising and spending programs. The first is a 7-year, $2.5 billion fund-raising campaign. The Partners Fund is proposed to expand the faculty of arts and science by 20 percent within five years.   2007: Plans are announced to open a portal campus in Abu Dhabi. When it opens in October 2009 it, along with the University's 10 other academic centers, will become part of NYU's Global Network University.        2010: NYU Abu Dhabi welcomes its inaugural class of students.   2013: NYU Shanghai welcomes its inaugural class of students.                            Open to All   One hundred and seventy five years ago, Albert Gallatin, the distinguished statesman who served as secretary of the treasury under President Thomas Jefferson, declared his intention to establish \u201cin this immense and fast-growing city \u2026 a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously open to all.\u201d     At that time, 1831, most students in American colleges and universities were members of the privileged classes. Albert Gallatin and the University\u2019s founding fathers planned NYU as a center of higher learning that would be open to all, regardless of national origin, religious beliefs, or social background.                                                             Visit the University Archives                                                                                         Institutional Research Fact Books                                         A Different University Today   While the University\u2019s commitment to these ideals remains unchanged, in many ways Albert Gallatin would scarcely recognize NYU today. From a student body of 158, enrollment has grown to nearly 40,000 students attending 14 schools and colleges at six different locations in Manhattan and in over 20 study-abroad countries around the world. Students come from many foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of 14 professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members.

School of Law established.   1841: School of Medicine established.   1894: The undergraduate college moves to more spacious University Heights campus in the Bronx. Back at Washington Square, the University Building is demolished and construction begins on the Main Building, later renamed the Silver Center.   1917: The U.S. enters World War I, decreasing University enrollment and straining the budget. Chancellor Brown establishes branches of the Student Army Training Corps fulfilling the University's public responsibility during the war, and also helping save the school from financial ruin.   1929: The stock market crashes on Black Tuesday, starting the Great Depression. In the coming years, Chancellor Chase founded the Division of Continuing Education,the Center for Research and Graduate Studies and the School of Public Service in order to keep enrollment up despite the economic state.          1941: After the U.S. enters World War II, military training was established on campus. The War Placement Bureau was organized to assign many of technically trained faculty and staff to military and civilian agency positions. The University Heights campus became largely militarized while liberal arts and language training was offered for Army officers at Washington Square. Following the war, the University received the largest contingent of returning veterans in the nation, and enrollment rose back to its pre-war levels.   1968: Student activism becomes a major part of university life, as students engage in civil rights demonstrations at Washington Square Park. The late 60s and early 70s sees an unprecedented degree of student involvement with civil rights and anti-war movements. Students also start demand changes within the University, staging sit-ins, boycotts, and marches protesting tuition and dormitory rate increases.   1970: President Hester\u2019s administration embarked on a mission to raise $222.5 million in five years, the largest fund-raising effort ever undertaken by the University.   1973: University Heights campus is closed, with the University's main campus shifting back to Washington Square.   1976: The annual commencement ceremony is shifted from Madison Square Garden to Washington Square Park.   1985: President Brademas introduces the Billion Dollar Campaign, a landmark fund-raising plan to raise $1 billion by the year 2000.        1995: President Brademas's $1 billion fund-raising goal is met five years early.   2001: The September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center send shockwaves through the University, which had occupied several downtown buildings as dormitories in 1998.   2004: President Sexton announces two new fund-raising and spending programs. The first is a 7-year, $2.5 billion fund-raising campaign. The Partners Fund is proposed to expand the faculty of arts and science by 20 percent within five years.   2007: Plans are announced to open a portal campus in Abu Dhabi. When it opens in October 2009 it, along with the University's 10 other academic centers, will become part of NYU's Global Network University.        2010: NYU Abu Dhabi welcomes its inaugural class of students.   2013: NYU Shanghai welcomes its inaugural class of students.                            Open to All   One hundred and seventy five years ago, Albert Gallatin, the distinguished statesman who served as secretary of the treasury under President Thomas Jefferson, declared his intention to establish \u201cin this immense and fast-growing city \u2026 a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously open to all.\u201d     At that time, 1831, most students in American colleges and universities were members of the privileged classes. Albert Gallatin and the University\u2019s founding fathers planned NYU as a center of higher learning that would be open to all, regardless of national origin, religious beliefs, or social background.

From a student body of 158, enrollment has grown to nearly 40,000 students attending 14 schools and colleges at six different locations in Manhattan and in over 20 study-abroad countries around the world. Students come from many foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of 14 professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members.

Truxes       The Master of Arts Program in World  History introduces students to the methods and approaches used by scholars to  study global and transnational history.    It also engages students in comparative and thematic work exploring the  history of at least two world regions.    This program is aimed at those who are seeking a historical perspective  on the increasingly interconnected global society in which we live. Among those whose needs may be served by the  MA in World History are educators, professionals involved in international occupations,  journalists or others working in the field of communications, and those  exploring their own interests through the study of global history. Acceptance into the World History MA Program  does not constitute admission into the Ph.D. program in the History Department  at New York University, but students intending to pursue a Ph.D. may later  apply for admission.      The core curriculum depends on the  student\u2019s choice of pursuing either the \u201cMA Essay Track\u201d or the \u201c Thesis  Track .\u201d The MA Essay track includes  eight one-semester courses (32 credit points), including three core courses,  three courses in a major field of study, and two courses in a minor field of  study.      The Masters Essay is a rewrite (a  developed and improved version) of a semester-length paper that has earned a  grade of \u2018A-\u2019 or above in one of the courses taken by a student in the World  History MA program. Students will submit their Masters Essays, together  with the original version of the paper (containing the grade and comments of  the course instructor) to the director of the World History MA program in the  semester before graduation. Students must present a master\u2019s essay, and they  must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language relevant to their  work.       The Thesis track includes eight  one-semester courses (32 credit points), including three core courses, two or  three courses in a major field of study, one or two courses in a minor field of  study, and a thesis course. Full-time  students wishing to write a thesis must declare their intention to do so by the  end of their first semester; part-time students must declare by the end of their second semester.  Students must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language relevant to  their work. Students may take cognate  courses in World History in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s program in  Humanities and Social Thought, and, with approval, up to two courses in  anthropology, sociology, politics, economics, or literature.      Students must undertake study of two  regions of the world, one of which will be designated as the major field and  one as the minor. The available regions are: Africa, East Asia, South Asia,  Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and North America.  Students must elect at least one field outside of Europe and North America.

They will  qualify for the degree when their master\u2019s essay has been approved or their  thesis successfully completed. Part-time  students will be allowed to stretch the program out over a maximum of six  semesters. Students may petition to  substitute one course that does not fit the above program if their special  needs, interests, or background justify it.    All course substitutions must be approved by the Program Director and  submitted to the Graduate Program Administrator.
