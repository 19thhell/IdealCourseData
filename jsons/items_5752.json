The primary goals of the program are to:            Provide a foundation in the clinical, behavioral and biomedical sciences that will enable the graduate to diagnose, manage and/or prevent diseases, abnormalities, and structural conditions affecting the periodontal tissues.   Engender the role of the specialist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team   Encourage residents to participate in dental education and to develop a philosophy of lifelong learning   Prepare residents to successfully qualify for the written and clinical components of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) Board Examination        The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association and fulfills all requirements for board eligibility as stated by the American Academy of Periodontology.   Program Strengths        Diverse clinical faculty, consisting of full and part-time members, many of whom hold joint appointments in the biomedical sciences or the Department of Implant Dentistry   Diverse and large patient population, which provides a wide range of clinical experiences   Opportunities for basic and/or clinical research within the College or through collaboration with the adjacent NYU Medical Center   Intensive didactic and clinical programs that focus on advanced and innovative approaches to therapy   Close collaboration with the Advanced Education Programs in Endodontics, Prosthodontics, and Orthodontics.                                                    Didactic Program                                  The didactic program embodies a formal curriculum in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences that has been developed specifically for the Advanced Education Program in Periodontics. The didactic program in the first year is largely devoted to the biomedical sciences, and residents experience a curriculum that constitutes a rich foundation in the relevant biomedical sciences specifically designed to prepare them for patient care. In addition to the biomedical sciences, first-year residents are also introduced to the fundamentals of clinical periodontics through a didactic curriculum that includes an extensive review of the classical literature, an in-depth review of anatomical pathophysiology, an introduction to advanced clinical periodontics, a series of interdisciplinary case reports, and an in-depth review of oral medicine. In the second and third years of the program, residents participate in an in-depth didactic program in the clinical sciences, with emphasis on more advanced diagnostic, treatment planning, and surgical and non-surgical therapeutic techniques.      Overall, approximately 20 percent of the program consists of didactic content. In the first year, courses in the biomedical sciences focus on topics such as Craniofacial Development, Biology of Bone, Research Techniques, Clinical Pharmacology, Head and Neck Anatomy, Host Response, and Pain and Anxiety Management. In addition, residents must complete a course in pedagogical techniques (Introduction to Pedagogy) and are expected to participate in the teaching program at the undergraduate (DDS) level. Supplementing the biomedical sciences are courses in the clinical sciences, which include (Classic) Literature Review I, Periodontics Clinic, and Periodontal Pathology I. In addition, all residents must successfully qualify in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS).      The curriculum in the second year includes a course specifically designed to provide basic analytical skills in assessing the scientific literature. Additional courses in the second and third years focus on the clinical sciences and include Surgical Implant Dentistry, Oral Implantology I, Periodontal Prosthesis, (Classic) Literature Review II, Current Literature III, Principles of Minor Tooth Movement, Oral Pathology Laboratory, Systemic Links to Periodontal Diseases, Periodontal Pathology II, and Practice Management. Second and third-year residents also rotate through the Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing facility, a 2,000-bed, long-term care health center, one of the largest facilities of its kind in the Northeast.      In additional to formal courses, throughout all three years, lectures, seminars, and case conferences that integrate the biomedical and clinical sciences constitute a vital part of the program. Residents actively participate in these sessions as part of their training and frequently serve as seminar leaders. Emphasis is placed on a biologic orientation and application of these principles to the clinical management of periodontal diseases. Informal academic gatherings are arranged with outstanding clinicians and scientists in periodontology and allied fields to provide a unique source of stimulation and knowledge.                                                              Clinical Program                               The clinical component of the program constitutes approximately 65 percent of the curriculum and is a major strength of the program. Situated in an urban center and adjacent to one of the major medical centers in the Northeast, (NYU Langone Medical Center), the periodontics clinic has available one of the largest patient pools nationally, representing a full range of periodontal diseases and conditions. In addition to conventional surgical and non-surgical modalities of periodontal therapy, residents gain broad experience in the following advanced surgical procedures:        Implant dentistry, including preparation of the implant site, as well as implant placement itself. Residents are trained in a number of site development strategies, including sinus lift, ridge augmentation, and guided bone regeneration. This is in conjunction with training in those phases of the procedure that are specifically involved in the actual surgical placement of the implant, employing a variety of implant-placement systems.   Functional and aesthetic surgical procedures, including hard and soft tissue grafting procedures.   Regenerative surgical procedures involving autogenous, allograft, and alloplastic bone substances, often in conjunction with the application of either two-stage non-resorbable, or single-stage, biodegradable, membrane barriers. In addition, advanced clinical training is provided in periodontal therapies in conjunction with therapies that address various endodontic, orthodontic, and prosthodontic conditions.                                                                Research Program                                  To obtain a general understanding of theory and methods of scientific research, all residents are required to engage in some form of scholarly activity. Residents are expected to be able to identify basic research design elements, specify research questions, evaluate types of study designs, and understand the role of statistics in scientific decision making. Structured, formal research activity is available through a master's degree offered by NYUCD, either in biomaterial science, biology/oral biology, or clinical research. Alternatively, residents may choose to prepare formal case reports and/or literature reviews for publication, present findings at national or regional professional meetings, or participate in basic or clinical research activities of the department or College.                                                              Teaching Program                                  Students obtain experience teaching dental students at the undergraduate level.                                                              Length of the Program                                  This is a 3-year (36 months) postdoctoral certificate program for the specialty practice of Periodontics.

The primary goals of the program are to:            Provide a foundation in the clinical, behavioral and biomedical sciences that will enable the graduate to diagnose, manage and/or prevent diseases, abnormalities, and structural conditions affecting the periodontal tissues.   Engender the role of the specialist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team   Encourage residents to participate in dental education and to develop a philosophy of lifelong learning   Prepare residents to successfully qualify for the written and clinical components of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) Board Examination        The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association and fulfills all requirements for board eligibility as stated by the American Academy of Periodontology.   Program Strengths        Diverse clinical faculty, consisting of full and part-time members, many of whom hold joint appointments in the biomedical sciences or the Department of Implant Dentistry   Diverse and large patient population, which provides a wide range of clinical experiences   Opportunities for basic and/or clinical research within the College or through collaboration with the adjacent NYU Medical Center   Intensive didactic and clinical programs that focus on advanced and innovative approaches to therapy   Close collaboration with the Advanced Education Programs in Endodontics, Prosthodontics, and Orthodontics.                                                    Didactic Program                                  The didactic program embodies a formal curriculum in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences that has been developed specifically for the Advanced Education Program in Periodontics. The didactic program in the first year is largely devoted to the biomedical sciences, and residents experience a curriculum that constitutes a rich foundation in the relevant biomedical sciences specifically designed to prepare them for patient care. In addition to the biomedical sciences, first-year residents are also introduced to the fundamentals of clinical periodontics through a didactic curriculum that includes an extensive review of the classical literature, an in-depth review of anatomical pathophysiology, an introduction to advanced clinical periodontics, a series of interdisciplinary case reports, and an in-depth review of oral medicine. In the second and third years of the program, residents participate in an in-depth didactic program in the clinical sciences, with emphasis on more advanced diagnostic, treatment planning, and surgical and non-surgical therapeutic techniques.      Overall, approximately 20 percent of the program consists of didactic content. In the first year, courses in the biomedical sciences focus on topics such as Craniofacial Development, Biology of Bone, Research Techniques, Clinical Pharmacology, Head and Neck Anatomy, Host Response, and Pain and Anxiety Management. In addition, residents must complete a course in pedagogical techniques (Introduction to Pedagogy) and are expected to participate in the teaching program at the undergraduate (DDS) level. Supplementing the biomedical sciences are courses in the clinical sciences, which include (Classic) Literature Review I, Periodontics Clinic, and Periodontal Pathology I. In addition, all residents must successfully qualify in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS).      The curriculum in the second year includes a course specifically designed to provide basic analytical skills in assessing the scientific literature. Additional courses in the second and third years focus on the clinical sciences and include Surgical Implant Dentistry, Oral Implantology I, Periodontal Prosthesis, (Classic) Literature Review II, Current Literature III, Principles of Minor Tooth Movement, Oral Pathology Laboratory, Systemic Links to Periodontal Diseases, Periodontal Pathology II, and Practice Management. Second and third-year residents also rotate through the Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing facility, a 2,000-bed, long-term care health center, one of the largest facilities of its kind in the Northeast.      In additional to formal courses, throughout all three years, lectures, seminars, and case conferences that integrate the biomedical and clinical sciences constitute a vital part of the program. Residents actively participate in these sessions as part of their training and frequently serve as seminar leaders. Emphasis is placed on a biologic orientation and application of these principles to the clinical management of periodontal diseases. Informal academic gatherings are arranged with outstanding clinicians and scientists in periodontology and allied fields to provide a unique source of stimulation and knowledge.                                                              Clinical Program                               The clinical component of the program constitutes approximately 65 percent of the curriculum and is a major strength of the program. Situated in an urban center and adjacent to one of the major medical centers in the Northeast, (NYU Langone Medical Center), the periodontics clinic has available one of the largest patient pools nationally, representing a full range of periodontal diseases and conditions. In addition to conventional surgical and non-surgical modalities of periodontal therapy, residents gain broad experience in the following advanced surgical procedures:        Implant dentistry, including preparation of the implant site, as well as implant placement itself. Residents are trained in a number of site development strategies, including sinus lift, ridge augmentation, and guided bone regeneration. This is in conjunction with training in those phases of the procedure that are specifically involved in the actual surgical placement of the implant, employing a variety of implant-placement systems.   Functional and aesthetic surgical procedures, including hard and soft tissue grafting procedures.   Regenerative surgical procedures involving autogenous, allograft, and alloplastic bone substances, often in conjunction with the application of either two-stage non-resorbable, or single-stage, biodegradable, membrane barriers. In addition, advanced clinical training is provided in periodontal therapies in conjunction with therapies that address various endodontic, orthodontic, and prosthodontic conditions.                                                                Research Program                                  To obtain a general understanding of theory and methods of scientific research, all residents are required to engage in some form of scholarly activity. Residents are expected to be able to identify basic research design elements, specify research questions, evaluate types of study designs, and understand the role of statistics in scientific decision making. Structured, formal research activity is available through a master's degree offered by NYUCD, either in biomaterial science, biology/oral biology, or clinical research. Alternatively, residents may choose to prepare formal case reports and/or literature reviews for publication, present findings at national or regional professional meetings, or participate in basic or clinical research activities of the department or College.                                                              Teaching Program                                  Students obtain experience teaching dental students at the undergraduate level.                                                              Length of the Program                                  This is a 3-year (36 months) postdoctoral certificate program for the specialty practice of Periodontics. The program runs July 1 through June 30.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .

The primary goals of the program are to:            Provide a foundation in the clinical, behavioral and biomedical sciences that will enable the graduate to diagnose, manage and/or prevent diseases, abnormalities, and structural conditions affecting the periodontal tissues.   Engender the role of the specialist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team   Encourage residents to participate in dental education and to develop a philosophy of lifelong learning   Prepare residents to successfully qualify for the written and clinical components of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) Board Examination        The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association and fulfills all requirements for board eligibility as stated by the American Academy of Periodontology.   Program Strengths        Diverse clinical faculty, consisting of full and part-time members, many of whom hold joint appointments in the biomedical sciences or the Department of Implant Dentistry   Diverse and large patient population, which provides a wide range of clinical experiences   Opportunities for basic and/or clinical research within the College or through collaboration with the adjacent NYU Medical Center   Intensive didactic and clinical programs that focus on advanced and innovative approaches to therapy   Close collaboration with the Advanced Education Programs in Endodontics, Prosthodontics, and Orthodontics.                                                    Didactic Program                                  The didactic program embodies a formal curriculum in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences that has been developed specifically for the Advanced Education Program in Periodontics. The didactic program in the first year is largely devoted to the biomedical sciences, and residents experience a curriculum that constitutes a rich foundation in the relevant biomedical sciences specifically designed to prepare them for patient care. In addition to the biomedical sciences, first-year residents are also introduced to the fundamentals of clinical periodontics through a didactic curriculum that includes an extensive review of the classical literature, an in-depth review of anatomical pathophysiology, an introduction to advanced clinical periodontics, a series of interdisciplinary case reports, and an in-depth review of oral medicine. In the second and third years of the program, residents participate in an in-depth didactic program in the clinical sciences, with emphasis on more advanced diagnostic, treatment planning, and surgical and non-surgical therapeutic techniques.      Overall, approximately 20 percent of the program consists of didactic content. In the first year, courses in the biomedical sciences focus on topics such as Craniofacial Development, Biology of Bone, Research Techniques, Clinical Pharmacology, Head and Neck Anatomy, Host Response, and Pain and Anxiety Management. In addition, residents must complete a course in pedagogical techniques (Introduction to Pedagogy) and are expected to participate in the teaching program at the undergraduate (DDS) level. Supplementing the biomedical sciences are courses in the clinical sciences, which include (Classic) Literature Review I, Periodontics Clinic, and Periodontal Pathology I. In addition, all residents must successfully qualify in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS).      The curriculum in the second year includes a course specifically designed to provide basic analytical skills in assessing the scientific literature. Additional courses in the second and third years focus on the clinical sciences and include Surgical Implant Dentistry, Oral Implantology I, Periodontal Prosthesis, (Classic) Literature Review II, Current Literature III, Principles of Minor Tooth Movement, Oral Pathology Laboratory, Systemic Links to Periodontal Diseases, Periodontal Pathology II, and Practice Management. Second and third-year residents also rotate through the Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing facility, a 2,000-bed, long-term care health center, one of the largest facilities of its kind in the Northeast.      In additional to formal courses, throughout all three years, lectures, seminars, and case conferences that integrate the biomedical and clinical sciences constitute a vital part of the program. Residents actively participate in these sessions as part of their training and frequently serve as seminar leaders. Emphasis is placed on a biologic orientation and application of these principles to the clinical management of periodontal diseases. Informal academic gatherings are arranged with outstanding clinicians and scientists in periodontology and allied fields to provide a unique source of stimulation and knowledge.                                                              Clinical Program                               The clinical component of the program constitutes approximately 65 percent of the curriculum and is a major strength of the program. Situated in an urban center and adjacent to one of the major medical centers in the Northeast, (NYU Langone Medical Center), the periodontics clinic has available one of the largest patient pools nationally, representing a full range of periodontal diseases and conditions. In addition to conventional surgical and non-surgical modalities of periodontal therapy, residents gain broad experience in the following advanced surgical procedures:        Implant dentistry, including preparation of the implant site, as well as implant placement itself. Residents are trained in a number of site development strategies, including sinus lift, ridge augmentation, and guided bone regeneration. This is in conjunction with training in those phases of the procedure that are specifically involved in the actual surgical placement of the implant, employing a variety of implant-placement systems.   Functional and aesthetic surgical procedures, including hard and soft tissue grafting procedures.   Regenerative surgical procedures involving autogenous, allograft, and alloplastic bone substances, often in conjunction with the application of either two-stage non-resorbable, or single-stage, biodegradable, membrane barriers. In addition, advanced clinical training is provided in periodontal therapies in conjunction with therapies that address various endodontic, orthodontic, and prosthodontic conditions.                                                                Research Program                                  To obtain a general understanding of theory and methods of scientific research, all residents are required to engage in some form of scholarly activity. Residents are expected to be able to identify basic research design elements, specify research questions, evaluate types of study designs, and understand the role of statistics in scientific decision making. Structured, formal research activity is available through a master's degree offered by NYUCD, either in biomaterial science, biology/oral biology, or clinical research. Alternatively, residents may choose to prepare formal case reports and/or literature reviews for publication, present findings at national or regional professional meetings, or participate in basic or clinical research activities of the department or College.                                                              Teaching Program                                  Students obtain experience teaching dental students at the undergraduate level.                                                              Length of the Program                                  This is a 3-year (36 months) postdoctoral certificate program for the specialty practice of Periodontics. The program runs July 1 through June 30.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .

In fulfilling this mission, the long-term goal of the Department is recognition as one of the leading programs in periodontics through outstanding educational programs, excellence in patient care, research, and scholarship.    Created from the Departments of Periodontics and Implant Dentistry, it represented a natural fusion of two highly acclaimed departments. The Department of Periodontology was created in 1924, and was the first undergraduate department devoted exclusively to periodontics to be established in a dental college in this country. In 1927, postgraduate instruction was introduced, and years later the department pioneered in giving postgraduate courses in the Spanish language. From 1928, the department continued to progress to a point where it represented one of the leading departments of its kind in the country, exemplified during this period by one of its most illustrious chairmen, Dr. Samuel Charles Miller (1934), author of the classic Textbook of Periodontia, which had three editions (1938, 1945, and 1950). In 1950, the department\u2019s name was changed to the Department of Periodontia and Oral Medicine, presaging current efforts to integrate medicine and dentistry. Currently, the department includes approximately 40 full- and part-time faculty members equally divided between the D.D.S. and postgraduate programs.    The Arthur Ashman Department of Implant Dentistry was founded in 1991 with three Fellows. In 1993 the International Program was established and has grown rapidly. At present the department has trained 122 international trained dentists from 26 countries along with 54 Fellows. In fact, the department has the largest implant-training program worldwide.    Today, the International Program\u2019s average combined class size (first- and second-year residents) is approximately 37 per year along with approximately six Fellows. Each year the program attracts residents from around the world who realize that with the advancements in technology that have occurred, implants are clearly the wave of the future.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    shared scientific core resources Read More                                                      Click on image above to view the 2014 Implant Alumni Symposium Program .          PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM                                                  First Year                               The first-year experience in periodontics is directed primarily toward providing an introduction to preventive care, risk assessment, and epidemiological considerations of periodontal diseases.                                                              Second Year                               The second-year experience in periodontics is directed toward providing students with fundamental skills, both intellectual and mechanical, to begin clinical treatment of patients. A series of lectures addressing etiology, histopathology, initial therapy, and preventive strategies in the treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases are taught in depth, with emphasis on the clinical management of gingivitis and early-to-moderate stages of periodontitis. During sophomore year, a brief introduction to surgical procedures is provided, with emphasis on indications, contraindications, and postoperative treatment.               In a simulation exercise that is both laboratory- and clinic-based, students are introduced to instrumentation for managing moderate inflammatory periodontal disease and are provided with a clinical experience to apply this knowledge.                                                              Third Year                               The third-year course provides foundation knowledge in the more advanced therapeutic modalities of periodontics, integrating principles of basic biomedical sciences, including histology, immunology, and pathophysiology. The course of study consists of both didactic instruction and clinical practice. Principles of managing the more advanced periodontal patient are presented in a series of lectures covering diagnosis, prognosis, histopathology, surgical and nonsurgical intervention, and pharmacotherapeutics. Clinical practice is devoted to the treatment of patients with uncomplicated inflammatory periodontal diseases under close supervision in a comprehensive care clinic. Small diagnosis and treatment planning seminars are held for informal discussion of periodontics, and individual student initiative is encouraged. Students chart, diagnose, prepare case analyses, and present cases to patients and faculty. This course serves as a basis for the student to be able to diagnose and treat more advanced cases in their fourth year.                                                              Fourth Year                               In the fourth year, instruction in periodontics continues with the student acting more independently within the framework of the comprehensive care program. With the exception of only the most advanced cases, students perform initial therapy on all periodontal patients. For those patients requiring surgical therapy, students assist postgraduate residents in the postgraduate clinic in all surgical procedures indicated for their patients, and depending on the clinical skills of the student, may also perform part of the surgical procedure itself. Students are evaluated on a regular basis during periodic competency exercises that are administered by the faculty. An honors course devoted entirely to clinical periodontics, including periodontal surgery, is available to a select group of highly motivated students with a particular interest and aptitude in this discipline of dentistry.   Implant curriculum. Undergraduate education of implants is a major focus of our newly restructured department. In collaboration with the department of Prosthodontics, the chief architects of this curriculum, and the department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, NYU College of Dentistry presents an integrated implant curriculum that emphasizes implants as a routine restoration in clinical dentistry. NYU is in the forefront in defining the standard of care for implant overdentures. Implants are taught in D2, D3 and D4 as part of the didactic, preclinical and clinical curricula. It has been defined as one of the competencies for our graduates.                      POSTDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   &gt; Advanced Education Program in Periodontics            INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM   &gt; Periodontics Program for International Dentists            RESEARCH   Representative research interests in the department include risk assessment for destructive periodontal diseases and systemic complications, periodontal regeneration, and cementogenesis on artificial substrates. Most recently, the department was awarded approximately $100,000 to study the relationship between destructive periodontitis and glycemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Furthermore, the department is active in research in the clinical and basic science studies of implants that require sinus grafts, immediate loading, new innovative implant designs, etc. Select students are involved in and assist faculty on research projects within the department.
