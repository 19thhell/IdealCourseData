Microsoft Security Vulnerabilities   On Tuesday, Microsoft identified two major vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system, in addition to other Microsoft products and non-critical updates. One vulnerability in particular exploits common system components for every major release of Windows since 95 and through Windows 10 (still in development) which can be used to retrieve Windows login credentials (username and password). These credentials can then be cracked in less than a day using moderate resources by an attacker. As of right now, there has been no patch for this vulnerability, identified as \"Redirect to SMB.\" To mitigate the risk posed by this vulnerability, TSS recommends following safe browsing and computing procedures. | More      Recent ITS News and Alerts        New Articles on a New Connect      Nominate a Student for a $500 NYU IT Computing Prize      A Note On Illegal Downloading           Recent Computer Security Alerts        Microsoft Security Vulnerabilities      TA15-051A: Lenovo Superfish Adware Vulnerable to HTTPS Spoofing      *New York University Email Alert [Code: 3141]* phishing scam           &raquo; All News and Alerts                                       About ITS                              Get Connected                               Communicate & Collaborate                               Help & Support                                 Computer Security                               Instruction & Research                               Locations & Facilities                                                           ITS Quick Links         Connect: IT at NYU        IT Service Catalog        ITS Policies &amp; Guidance        Mobile Device Support         NetID and password        NYURoam Wireless        NYU Calendar        NYU Classes        NYU Email        NYU Google Apps        NYU Start page         Remote Instruction Support         ResNet         ServiceLink        Training & workshops                                Notices &amp; Alerts        IT Service Status        ITS News &amp; Security Alerts        NYU Info Alert Page        BobCat                             NYU IT Resources        NYUHome        Main NYU Site        NYU Libraries        NYU Computer Store        NYU Mobile App        Digital Communications        Law IT Services        Stern IT Services                                Ask ITS      ITS is here to help!

Microsoft Security Vulnerabilities   On Tuesday, Microsoft identified two major vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system, in addition to other Microsoft products and non-critical updates. One vulnerability in particular exploits common system components for every major release of Windows since 95 and through Windows 10 (still in development) which can be used to retrieve Windows login credentials (username and password). These credentials can then be cracked in less than a day using moderate resources by an attacker. As of right now, there has been no patch for this vulnerability, identified as \"Redirect to SMB.\" To mitigate the risk posed by this vulnerability, TSS recommends following safe browsing and computing procedures. | More      Recent ITS News and Alerts        New Articles on a New Connect      Nominate a Student for a $500 NYU IT Computing Prize      A Note On Illegal Downloading           Recent Computer Security Alerts        Microsoft Security Vulnerabilities      TA15-051A: Lenovo Superfish Adware Vulnerable to HTTPS Spoofing      *New York University Email Alert [Code: 3141]* phishing scam           &raquo; All News and Alerts                                       About ITS                              Get Connected                               Communicate & Collaborate                               Help & Support                                 Computer Security                               Instruction & Research                               Locations & Facilities                                                           ITS Quick Links         Connect: IT at NYU        IT Service Catalog        ITS Policies &amp; Guidance        Mobile Device Support         NetID and password        NYURoam Wireless        NYU Calendar        NYU Classes        NYU Email        NYU Google Apps        NYU Start page         Remote Instruction Support         ResNet         ServiceLink        Training & workshops                                Notices &amp; Alerts        IT Service Status        ITS News &amp; Security Alerts        NYU Info Alert Page        BobCat                             NYU IT Resources        NYUHome        Main NYU Site        NYU Libraries        NYU Computer Store        NYU Mobile App        Digital Communications        Law IT Services        Stern IT Services                                Ask ITS      ITS is here to help!
