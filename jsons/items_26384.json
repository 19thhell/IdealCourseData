In addition to financial assistance, students in the program receive supportive services including counseling and tutoring to help ensure their success. Students must meet academic and family income guidelines to be eligible, and must attend a six-week summer program prior to the start of their freshman year. No special application is required for HEOP consideration, and New York State residents are automatically reviewed for eligibility during our normal application review process.
