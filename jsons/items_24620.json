As the vessels differentiate during  fetal and postnatal life, two main principles of organization are  maintained.      LAYERED ARRANGEMENT OF THE WALL     Classically, three layers or tunicas are described:      Tunica intima - This layer is the innermost layer. Its  function is mainly to provide a semi-permeable barrier. It is composed  of an endothelial cell layer, basal lamina and then varying amounts of  subendothelial connective tissue.      Tunica media - This layer is responsible for providing most  of the elastic tension and the contraction in blood vessels. It  contains varying amounts of smooth muscle and elastic tissue.      Tunica adventitia - This is the outermost layer. It is the  nutrient layer for the vessel or heart and as such it has blood, nerve  and lymphatic components.     Generally (although not embryologically) speaking the three layers of  the heart wall ( endocardium, myocardium and epicardium )  are analogous to the three layers of the blood vessel walls (tunicae  intima, media and adventitia).      SEGMENTAL SPECIALIZATION     The functions of the different segments are:      Blood Circulatory System      Heart : Pumping and secretion, by atrial myocytes, of   atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) , a peptide hormone which plays a  role in the complex regulation of blood pressure and fluid  homeostasis      Elastic arteries : Conduction. Pressure-tension  transduction      Muscular arteries : Distribution      Arterioles : Resistance - regulation of blood flow to  tissues      Capillaries : Metabolic and gas exchange      Pericytic venules : Metabolic exchange and main egress site for white blood cells      Muscular venules : Returning vessels      Veins : Capacitance vessels      Lymphatic Circulatory System      Lymphatic capillaries : Collection of lymph from the  interstitial fluid and of fat soluble nutrients in the gut      Lymphatic vessels : Carry lymph to and from lymph nodes; return lymph to veins in neck.

OBJECTIVES      To be able to:      Compare the components of the walls of the different elements  of the circulatory system, i.e. arteries, veins, lymphatics and  capillaries of different caliber.      Describe the qualitative and quantitative morphological changes that  these components undergo as they progress from the heart to the  capillaries and back to the heart.      Describe the most important functional aspects of the circulatory  system and the way in which the morphological features of the different  vessels correlate with these functions.      Discuss the general ultrastructural characteristics of endothelial  cells as well as the differences observed in the ultrastructure of both  endothelial cells and their basement membrane in the different types of  capillaries: continuous, fenestrated and sinusoidal.      LAB GUIDE        A. Muscular (small and medium sized) Arteries and Veins,  Capillaries, Lymphatics. Slides 24, 48, 49, 110, 124, and 125 (See  illustrations on CS-4, 5 and 6)     In any one of slides 24, 33, 48 or 49 you will be able to look for the  different classes of blood vessels. Use CS-4 and   CS-5 as a guide to identification. Very often the  vessels are found in bundles that include nerve, artery, vein and  lymphatic elements, surrounded by a connective tissue sheath.  Capillaries are located in close proximity to muscle fibers in the  tongue (slides 48, 49 and 110). They are especially clear in slide 110.  The red cell (diameter = 6-8) is a good reference for size. Only one  red cell fits into the cross-section of one capillary. Blood vessels may  be found in longitudinal, transverse or oblique sections, which you can  distinguish if you remember that:      the nuclei of both the endothelial cells and smooth muscle  cells of a vessel wall are ovoid.      the endothelial cell nuclei have their major axis oriented along  axis of the blood vessel; therefore, they appear quite round in  transverse sections and ovoid in longitudinal sections of their  vessels.      the muscle cell nuclei have their major axis oriented circumferentially around the  blood vessels; therefore, they appear round in longitudinal sections and  ovoid in transverse sections of the vessel.     The walls of capillaries consist only of endothelium and underlying  basal lamina. Usually only one endothelial cell nucleus is observed in  a transverse section. On slide 110, the PAS staining of the capillary  basal lamina outlines the rich capillary network associated with the  skeletal muscle of the tongue. Capillaries and small lymphatics are  most easily identifiable in plastic embedded tissues (slides 124,  125). Chart CS-6 gives features of different types of capillaries seen at the EM level.      Pericytic venules are larger than capillaries; 2-4 endothelial  nuclei may be observed in their endothelial lining. Pericytes   are difficult to identify conclusively at the LM level. However, if you  see a muscle-like cell closely associated with the endothelial cells and  the profile of the cell's nucleus is the same as the endothelial cell,  it is a likely candidate; many pericytes are oriented with  their long axis parallel to the flow of blood. Their nuclei may also  appear to be more heterochromatic than those of the endothelial cells.     In studying the larger blood vessels, it is practical to first identify  the layers which invest the endothelium (tunica intima, tunica media and  tunica adventitia) at low power. Since branches of the arterial and  venous systems travel together, it is easiest to study them by  comparison. Note the thickness of the three tunic layers in  relationship to the diameter of the vessel. The arterial vessels usually  have a thicker wall in relation to their diameter than their companion  branches of the venous system. Identify the cellular components of the  layers and assess their relative proportions in each layer.        Arterioles have slightly larger diameter than capillaries and a thicker wall. They  usually possess an internal elastic membrane , which  is separated from the endothelium by a very thin layer of connective  tissue. The internal elastic membrane is usually not fully distended.  It appears wavy and homogenous-staining, often giving the  lumen a scalloped appearance. This is due to contraction of the smooth  muscle in the arteriole wall. Arterioles have one or two layers of  smooth muscle cells. The companion venules of arterioles are of  larger diameter, have only a few smooth muscle cells in the tunica media  and no internal elastic membrane. Because venules lack large amounts of  smooth muscle they may often appear collapsed or be filled with pooled  blood.      Muscular arteries and veins are a class of blood vessels of various  sizes. Muscular arteries have between 3-40 concentric layers of smooth  muscle. The smaller diameter arteries (3-30 layers of smooth muscle) run  with companion vessels known as small veins whereas the larger muscular arteries (30-40 layers)  run with companion vessels known as medium veins. Note the thicker wall  of the artery and the presence of both internal and external elastic  membranes. The wall of the vein is much thinner in relationship to the  diameter of the vessel and it has no internal elastic lamina or external  elastic lamina.      Lymphatic vessels are extremely thin-walled and difficult to  visualize either grossly or histologically. The lymphatic vessels start  out as blindly ending lymph capillaries, which have thinner wall and are  larger in diameter than blood capillaries. Their endothelium allows  passage of molecules too large to be transported into blood capillaries.  For example, lipids are transported into lacteals , which are  lymph capillaries in intestinal villi (see below slides 58 and 60), and  proteins are taken up from the connective tissue compartment. These  substances, together with extracellular fluid taken up from the  connective tissue and cells produced by the lymphatic tissues and  organs, comprise the lymph. Lymph is filtered through lymph nodes and ultimately are contributed to the blood circulation, primarily through  communications with the large veins at the base of the neck.     Although lymph capillaries are abundant and larger than blood  capillaries, their walls are so thin that they easily collapse. It is  often impossible to distinguish them from clefts in the tissue section.  Larger lymphatics , well endowed with  valves, accompany blood vessels, so that typically arteries, veins and  lymphatics travel together. However, even larger vessels may be  difficult to identify because their walls are thinner and less well  organized than those of either veins or arteries. The best way to  identify lymphatic vessels is the presence of lymphocytes and precipitated lymph inside  the lumen, but absence of RBCs that are found in the accompanying vessels of the  blood system.      B. Elastic Arteries. Slides 25 and 32     Large arteries have abundant elastic tissue in their tunica media.  Compare the H&E stained section of a human aorta   (slide 25) and a section of human pulmonary artery stained  for elastin (slide 32). In the H&amp;E preparation the circularly  arranged fenestrated elastic membranes of the tunica media appear as  wavy bands of yellow or pink refractile material between the layers of smooth  muscle cells. In the preparation stained for elastin they are stained  brown to black. A few of your boxes may have a newer slide 25 that has  been stained to show both elastin (black) and muscle (pink). Keep in  mind that the companion vessels to the elastic arteries would be the  large veins like the vena cava and brachiocephalic vein.  These large veins do possess an internal elastic lamina. Consult your  atlas and the chart in this chapter for other characteristics.      C. Heart: Aortic and Atrioventricular Valves. Slides 30*, 31*, 29,  and 34     Using either an inverted ocular or by eye, orient yourself on slides 30  and 31 by comparing your slide to the accompanying diagram ( CS-8 ) of these sections. In the wall of the  ventricle identify the endocardium (faded, very pale staining), myocardium and   epicardium . The latter includes adipose tissue in which you may  find branches of the coronary vessels, the coronary nerve plexus and  some terminal ganglion cells.     Slide 30 shows the aortic semilunar valve at the junction between the  aorta and the left ventricle. The aorta is cut in longitudinal section.  Smooth muscle cells, stained bright red, are seen in cross section.  Elastic fibers are paler pink to orange while collagen is blue.     Slide 31 shows a section of the left atrium and left ventricle with one cusp  of the mitral valve . Look for coronary  vessels in epicardium. Many slides lack a section of the coronary  vein. The coronary artery has a thick tunica intima containing  longitudinally-oriented smooth muscle cells (seen as red dots in cross  section). Such intimal thickening is a part of the aging process.     Review slides 29 and 34 for cardiac muscle structure, including Purkinje cells (slide 29)..      D. Miscellaneous aspects of the circulatory system      Whole mount of mesentary. Slide 100     Remember that there are two types of slides 100, one sained with Giemsa, the other for elastin. In the Giemsa stained slides 100, medium-sized arteries and companion  veins are seen in toto . Arteries are dark blue due to the  thickness of their wall. The nuclei of smooth muscle cells in the  tunica media are perpendicular to the long axis of the vessel,  reflecting their circular arrangement. Veins appear red due to the red  blood cells in the lumen, seen through their thinner walls. Lymphatics are recognizable by their large diameter and very thin walls, through which valves and lymphocytes may be seen. Lymphatics also have a bulbous appearance where the valves are located. In the  slides 100 stained for elastin, the blood vessels cannot be seen very  well.     Examine the periphery of the whole mount for capillary loops . Size is the  best criterion, approximately the diameter of one red blood cell. Larger  diameter, simple endothelial-lined tubes are probably venules.  Arterioles have one or two layers of smooth muscle cells.      Lacteals. Slides 58 and 60     Slide 58 is from the small intestine of a monkey fed a fat-rich meal.   Fats are absorbed by lacteals and in this slide the distended lacteals  or lymphatic capillaries appear as empty spaces, lined by endothelium, in the very cellular loose connective  tissue underlying the intestinal epithelium. Their empty appearance is due to the extraction of the fats during tissue preparation. Compare  the appearance of the lacteals in slide 58 with those in slide 60 where lacteals are collapsed.      Microvasculature. Slides 113, 125, 65, and 117 ( See diagrams on CS-6 )     In slide 113 abundant small blood vessels (capillaries, arterioles and  venules) are clearly seen in the connective tissue surrounding the  paraffin pellet.     Slide 125, a plastic section of the trachea or a large bronchus, has very  clear arterioles and venules in the connective tissue beneath the lining  epithelium.     Sinusoids can be seen in slide 65 of liver and slide 117 of spleen. They  are usually of larger diameter than capillaries and are lined by an  endothelium that may have phagocytic cells lying just outside of it. In the spleen, slide 117,  the sinusoids are filled with red blood cells, making them easy to  locate under low power. Here the endothelial cells are spindle-shaped  and oriented longitudinally.     In liver, the vascular spaces between the plates of hepatocytes can also be identified by the red blood cells within them. These sinusoids are lined in part by the phagocytic Kupffer cells, which  can be demonstrated by their ability to phagocytize vital stains such as  trypan blue (slide 65) or particulate matters, such as Ti0 2   (slide 111).      Variability of blood vessels. Slide 27     Blood vessels vary in structure depending upon their location and  functional requirements. For example, in the lung (slide 27) the pulmonary arteries accompanying bronchi have thinner walls  than might be expected for arteries of their diameter in the systemic circulatory system. The blood  pressure in the pulmonary arteries is lower than that in their systemic  counterparts of the same diameter. Pulmonary veins collect oxygenated  blood from alveoli and from the pleura. Pulmonary veins run alone in  the septa of the lung and have very thin-walls for their diameter.  Bronchial arteries accompany pulmonary arteries but do not extend beyond  the respiratory bronchioles. Bronchial veins are present only in the  hilus of the lobes. Lymphatics accompany the larger airways and, with  careful examination, can be found in their walls.      EXERCISE: Blood vessels may be found on slides of all organs;  try the spermatic cord, slide 76.      STUDY QUESTIONS      For each of the vessels in the list, match its characteristics  from the panel beneath.        Sinusoids in the liver     Capillary in  the back of the hand  Arteriole in the tongue  Capillary in the mucosa of  the ileum  Venule in a skeletal muscle       The Endothelium is...

What are the main structural and functional differences between  lymph vessels and vessels of the arterial-venous system?      What regions of which organs in the body lack lymphatics?      Describe the main morphological changes in the aorta and large  arteries during aging.      Correlate the classically described layers present in major arteries  and veins with their equivalents in the heart. Point out the  morphological differences between the layers and correlate them with  their function.      In which of the small vessels does most fluid leakage and diapedesis  of cells into surrounding tissue occur, normally and during shock?      Why are veins and lymphatics more likely than arteries to be involved in metastatic  spread of tumors?      Is the circulatory system a \"closed system\". Give examples, if any,  of where it is \"open\".      Compare the pulmonary vessels with ones of similar diameter in the systemic circulation.

Slides 24, 48, 49, 110, 124, and 125 (See  illustrations on CS-4, 5 and 6)     In any one of slides 24, 33, 48 or 49 you will be able to look for the  different classes of blood vessels. Use CS-4 and   CS-5 as a guide to identification. Very often the  vessels are found in bundles that include nerve, artery, vein and  lymphatic elements, surrounded by a connective tissue sheath.  Capillaries are located in close proximity to muscle fibers in the  tongue (slides 48, 49 and 110). They are especially clear in slide 110.  The red cell (diameter = 6-8) is a good reference for size. Only one  red cell fits into the cross-section of one capillary. Blood vessels may  be found in longitudinal, transverse or oblique sections, which you can  distinguish if you remember that:      the nuclei of both the endothelial cells and smooth muscle  cells of a vessel wall are ovoid.      the endothelial cell nuclei have their major axis oriented along  axis of the blood vessel; therefore, they appear quite round in  transverse sections and ovoid in longitudinal sections of their  vessels.      the muscle cell nuclei have their major axis oriented circumferentially around the  blood vessels; therefore, they appear round in longitudinal sections and  ovoid in transverse sections of the vessel.

B. Elastic Arteries. Slides 25 and 32     Large arteries have abundant elastic tissue in their tunica media.  Compare the H&E stained section of a human aorta   (slide 25) and a section of human pulmonary artery stained  for elastin (slide 32). In the H&amp;E preparation the circularly  arranged fenestrated elastic membranes of the tunica media appear as  wavy bands of yellow or pink refractile material between the layers of smooth  muscle cells. In the preparation stained for elastin they are stained  brown to black. A few of your boxes may have a newer slide 25 that has  been stained to show both elastin (black) and muscle (pink). Keep in  mind that the companion vessels to the elastic arteries would be the  large veins like the vena cava and brachiocephalic vein.  These large veins do possess an internal elastic lamina. Consult your  atlas and the chart in this chapter for other characteristics.      C. Heart: Aortic and Atrioventricular Valves. Slides 30*, 31*, 29,  and 34     Using either an inverted ocular or by eye, orient yourself on slides 30  and 31 by comparing your slide to the accompanying diagram ( CS-8 ) of these sections. In the wall of the  ventricle identify the endocardium (faded, very pale staining), myocardium and   epicardium . The latter includes adipose tissue in which you may  find branches of the coronary vessels, the coronary nerve plexus and  some terminal ganglion cells.     Slide 30 shows the aortic semilunar valve at the junction between the  aorta and the left ventricle. The aorta is cut in longitudinal section.  Smooth muscle cells, stained bright red, are seen in cross section.  Elastic fibers are paler pink to orange while collagen is blue.     Slide 31 shows a section of the left atrium and left ventricle with one cusp  of the mitral valve . Look for coronary  vessels in epicardium. Many slides lack a section of the coronary  vein. The coronary artery has a thick tunica intima containing  longitudinally-oriented smooth muscle cells (seen as red dots in cross  section). Such intimal thickening is a part of the aging process.     Review slides 29 and 34 for cardiac muscle structure, including Purkinje cells (slide 29)..      D. Miscellaneous aspects of the circulatory system      Whole mount of mesentary. Slide 100     Remember that there are two types of slides 100, one sained with Giemsa, the other for elastin.

Fats are absorbed by lacteals and in this slide the distended lacteals  or lymphatic capillaries appear as empty spaces, lined by endothelium, in the very cellular loose connective  tissue underlying the intestinal epithelium. Their empty appearance is due to the extraction of the fats during tissue preparation. Compare  the appearance of the lacteals in slide 58 with those in slide 60 where lacteals are collapsed.      Microvasculature. Slides 113, 125, 65, and 117 ( See diagrams on CS-6 )     In slide 113 abundant small blood vessels (capillaries, arterioles and  venules) are clearly seen in the connective tissue surrounding the  paraffin pellet.     Slide 125, a plastic section of the trachea or a large bronchus, has very  clear arterioles and venules in the connective tissue beneath the lining  epithelium.     Sinusoids can be seen in slide 65 of liver and slide 117 of spleen. They  are usually of larger diameter than capillaries and are lined by an  endothelium that may have phagocytic cells lying just outside of it. In the spleen, slide 117,  the sinusoids are filled with red blood cells, making them easy to  locate under low power. Here the endothelial cells are spindle-shaped  and oriented longitudinally.     In liver, the vascular spaces between the plates of hepatocytes can also be identified by the red blood cells within them. These sinusoids are lined in part by the phagocytic Kupffer cells, which  can be demonstrated by their ability to phagocytize vital stains such as  trypan blue (slide 65) or particulate matters, such as Ti0 2   (slide 111).      Variability of blood vessels. Slide 27     Blood vessels vary in structure depending upon their location and  functional requirements. For example, in the lung (slide 27) the pulmonary arteries accompanying bronchi have thinner walls  than might be expected for arteries of their diameter in the systemic circulatory system. The blood  pressure in the pulmonary arteries is lower than that in their systemic  counterparts of the same diameter. Pulmonary veins collect oxygenated  blood from alveoli and from the pleura.

As the vessels differentiate during  fetal and postnatal life, two main principles of organization are  maintained.      LAYERED ARRANGEMENT OF THE WALL     Classically, three layers or tunicas are described:      Tunica intima - This layer is the innermost layer. Its  function is mainly to provide a semi-permeable barrier. It is composed  of an endothelial cell layer, basal lamina and then varying amounts of  subendothelial connective tissue.      Tunica media - This layer is responsible for providing most  of the elastic tension and the contraction in blood vessels. It  contains varying amounts of smooth muscle and elastic tissue.      Tunica adventitia - This is the outermost layer. It is the  nutrient layer for the vessel or heart and as such it has blood, nerve  and lymphatic components.     Generally (although not embryologically) speaking the three layers of  the heart wall ( endocardium, myocardium and epicardium )  are analogous to the three layers of the blood vessel walls (tunicae  intima, media and adventitia).      SEGMENTAL SPECIALIZATION     The functions of the different segments are:      Blood Circulatory System      Heart : Pumping and secretion, by atrial myocytes, of   atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) , a peptide hormone which plays a  role in the complex regulation of blood pressure and fluid  homeostasis      Elastic arteries : Conduction.

OBJECTIVES      To be able to:      Compare the components of the walls of the different elements  of the circulatory system, i.e. arteries, veins, lymphatics and  capillaries of different caliber.      Describe the qualitative and quantitative morphological changes that  these components undergo as they progress from the heart to the  capillaries and back to the heart.      Describe the most important functional aspects of the circulatory  system and the way in which the morphological features of the different  vessels correlate with these functions.      Discuss the general ultrastructural characteristics of endothelial  cells as well as the differences observed in the ultrastructure of both  endothelial cells and their basement membrane in the different types of  capillaries: continuous, fenestrated and sinusoidal.      LAB GUIDE        A. Muscular (small and medium sized) Arteries and Veins,  Capillaries, Lymphatics. Slides 24, 48, 49, 110, 124, and 125 (See  illustrations on CS-4, 5 and 6)     In any one of slides 24, 33, 48 or 49 you will be able to look for the  different classes of blood vessels. Use CS-4 and   CS-5 as a guide to identification. Very often the  vessels are found in bundles that include nerve, artery, vein and  lymphatic elements, surrounded by a connective tissue sheath.  Capillaries are located in close proximity to muscle fibers in the  tongue (slides 48, 49 and 110). They are especially clear in slide 110.  The red cell (diameter = 6-8) is a good reference for size. Only one  red cell fits into the cross-section of one capillary. Blood vessels may  be found in longitudinal, transverse or oblique sections, which you can  distinguish if you remember that:      the nuclei of both the endothelial cells and smooth muscle  cells of a vessel wall are ovoid.      the endothelial cell nuclei have their major axis oriented along  axis of the blood vessel; therefore, they appear quite round in  transverse sections and ovoid in longitudinal sections of their  vessels.      the muscle cell nuclei have their major axis oriented circumferentially around the  blood vessels; therefore, they appear round in longitudinal sections and  ovoid in transverse sections of the vessel.     The walls of capillaries consist only of endothelium and underlying  basal lamina. Usually only one endothelial cell nucleus is observed in  a transverse section. On slide 110, the PAS staining of the capillary  basal lamina outlines the rich capillary network associated with the  skeletal muscle of the tongue. Capillaries and small lymphatics are  most easily identifiable in plastic embedded tissues (slides 124,  125). Chart CS-6 gives features of different types of capillaries seen at the EM level.      Pericytic venules are larger than capillaries; 2-4 endothelial  nuclei may be observed in their endothelial lining. Pericytes   are difficult to identify conclusively at the LM level. However, if you  see a muscle-like cell closely associated with the endothelial cells and  the profile of the cell's nucleus is the same as the endothelial cell,  it is a likely candidate; many pericytes are oriented with  their long axis parallel to the flow of blood. Their nuclei may also  appear to be more heterochromatic than those of the endothelial cells.     In studying the larger blood vessels, it is practical to first identify  the layers which invest the endothelium (tunica intima, tunica media and  tunica adventitia) at low power. Since branches of the arterial and  venous systems travel together, it is easiest to study them by  comparison. Note the thickness of the three tunic layers in  relationship to the diameter of the vessel. The arterial vessels usually  have a thicker wall in relation to their diameter than their companion  branches of the venous system. Identify the cellular components of the  layers and assess their relative proportions in each layer.        Arterioles have slightly larger diameter than capillaries and a thicker wall. They  usually possess an internal elastic membrane , which  is separated from the endothelium by a very thin layer of connective  tissue. The internal elastic membrane is usually not fully distended.  It appears wavy and homogenous-staining, often giving the  lumen a scalloped appearance. This is due to contraction of the smooth  muscle in the arteriole wall. Arterioles have one or two layers of  smooth muscle cells. The companion venules of arterioles are of  larger diameter, have only a few smooth muscle cells in the tunica media  and no internal elastic membrane. Because venules lack large amounts of  smooth muscle they may often appear collapsed or be filled with pooled  blood.      Muscular arteries and veins are a class of blood vessels of various  sizes. Muscular arteries have between 3-40 concentric layers of smooth  muscle. The smaller diameter arteries (3-30 layers of smooth muscle) run  with companion vessels known as small veins whereas the larger muscular arteries (30-40 layers)  run with companion vessels known as medium veins. Note the thicker wall  of the artery and the presence of both internal and external elastic  membranes. The wall of the vein is much thinner in relationship to the  diameter of the vessel and it has no internal elastic lamina or external  elastic lamina.      Lymphatic vessels are extremely thin-walled and difficult to  visualize either grossly or histologically. The lymphatic vessels start  out as blindly ending lymph capillaries, which have thinner wall and are  larger in diameter than blood capillaries. Their endothelium allows  passage of molecules too large to be transported into blood capillaries.  For example, lipids are transported into lacteals , which are  lymph capillaries in intestinal villi (see below slides 58 and 60), and  proteins are taken up from the connective tissue compartment. These  substances, together with extracellular fluid taken up from the  connective tissue and cells produced by the lymphatic tissues and  organs, comprise the lymph. Lymph is filtered through lymph nodes and ultimately are contributed to the blood circulation, primarily through  communications with the large veins at the base of the neck.     Although lymph capillaries are abundant and larger than blood  capillaries, their walls are so thin that they easily collapse. It is  often impossible to distinguish them from clefts in the tissue section.  Larger lymphatics , well endowed with  valves, accompany blood vessels, so that typically arteries, veins and  lymphatics travel together. However, even larger vessels may be  difficult to identify because their walls are thinner and less well  organized than those of either veins or arteries. The best way to  identify lymphatic vessels is the presence of lymphocytes and precipitated lymph inside  the lumen, but absence of RBCs that are found in the accompanying vessels of the  blood system.      B. Elastic Arteries. Slides 25 and 32     Large arteries have abundant elastic tissue in their tunica media.  Compare the H&E stained section of a human aorta   (slide 25) and a section of human pulmonary artery stained  for elastin (slide 32). In the H&amp;E preparation the circularly  arranged fenestrated elastic membranes of the tunica media appear as  wavy bands of yellow or pink refractile material between the layers of smooth  muscle cells. In the preparation stained for elastin they are stained  brown to black. A few of your boxes may have a newer slide 25 that has  been stained to show both elastin (black) and muscle (pink). Keep in  mind that the companion vessels to the elastic arteries would be the  large veins like the vena cava and brachiocephalic vein.  These large veins do possess an internal elastic lamina. Consult your  atlas and the chart in this chapter for other characteristics.      C. Heart: Aortic and Atrioventricular Valves. Slides 30*, 31*, 29,  and 34     Using either an inverted ocular or by eye, orient yourself on slides 30  and 31 by comparing your slide to the accompanying diagram ( CS-8 ) of these sections. In the wall of the  ventricle identify the endocardium (faded, very pale staining), myocardium and   epicardium . The latter includes adipose tissue in which you may  find branches of the coronary vessels, the coronary nerve plexus and  some terminal ganglion cells.     Slide 30 shows the aortic semilunar valve at the junction between the  aorta and the left ventricle. The aorta is cut in longitudinal section.  Smooth muscle cells, stained bright red, are seen in cross section.  Elastic fibers are paler pink to orange while collagen is blue.     Slide 31 shows a section of the left atrium and left ventricle with one cusp  of the mitral valve . Look for coronary  vessels in epicardium. Many slides lack a section of the coronary  vein. The coronary artery has a thick tunica intima containing  longitudinally-oriented smooth muscle cells (seen as red dots in cross  section). Such intimal thickening is a part of the aging process.     Review slides 29 and 34 for cardiac muscle structure, including Purkinje cells (slide 29)..      D. Miscellaneous aspects of the circulatory system      Whole mount of mesentary. Slide 100     Remember that there are two types of slides 100, one sained with Giemsa, the other for elastin. In the Giemsa stained slides 100, medium-sized arteries and companion  veins are seen in toto . Arteries are dark blue due to the  thickness of their wall. The nuclei of smooth muscle cells in the  tunica media are perpendicular to the long axis of the vessel,  reflecting their circular arrangement. Veins appear red due to the red  blood cells in the lumen, seen through their thinner walls. Lymphatics are recognizable by their large diameter and very thin walls, through which valves and lymphocytes may be seen. Lymphatics also have a bulbous appearance where the valves are located. In the  slides 100 stained for elastin, the blood vessels cannot be seen very  well.     Examine the periphery of the whole mount for capillary loops . Size is the  best criterion, approximately the diameter of one red blood cell. Larger  diameter, simple endothelial-lined tubes are probably venules.  Arterioles have one or two layers of smooth muscle cells.      Lacteals. Slides 58 and 60     Slide 58 is from the small intestine of a monkey fed a fat-rich meal.   Fats are absorbed by lacteals and in this slide the distended lacteals  or lymphatic capillaries appear as empty spaces, lined by endothelium, in the very cellular loose connective  tissue underlying the intestinal epithelium. Their empty appearance is due to the extraction of the fats during tissue preparation. Compare  the appearance of the lacteals in slide 58 with those in slide 60 where lacteals are collapsed.      Microvasculature. Slides 113, 125, 65, and 117 ( See diagrams on CS-6 )     In slide 113 abundant small blood vessels (capillaries, arterioles and  venules) are clearly seen in the connective tissue surrounding the  paraffin pellet.     Slide 125, a plastic section of the trachea or a large bronchus, has very  clear arterioles and venules in the connective tissue beneath the lining  epithelium.     Sinusoids can be seen in slide 65 of liver and slide 117 of spleen. They  are usually of larger diameter than capillaries and are lined by an  endothelium that may have phagocytic cells lying just outside of it. In the spleen, slide 117,  the sinusoids are filled with red blood cells, making them easy to  locate under low power. Here the endothelial cells are spindle-shaped  and oriented longitudinally.     In liver, the vascular spaces between the plates of hepatocytes can also be identified by the red blood cells within them. These sinusoids are lined in part by the phagocytic Kupffer cells, which  can be demonstrated by their ability to phagocytize vital stains such as  trypan blue (slide 65) or particulate matters, such as Ti0 2   (slide 111).      Variability of blood vessels. Slide 27     Blood vessels vary in structure depending upon their location and  functional requirements. For example, in the lung (slide 27) the pulmonary arteries accompanying bronchi have thinner walls  than might be expected for arteries of their diameter in the systemic circulatory system. The blood  pressure in the pulmonary arteries is lower than that in their systemic  counterparts of the same diameter. Pulmonary veins collect oxygenated  blood from alveoli and from the pleura. Pulmonary veins run alone in  the septa of the lung and have very thin-walls for their diameter.  Bronchial arteries accompany pulmonary arteries but do not extend beyond  the respiratory bronchioles. Bronchial veins are present only in the  hilus of the lobes. Lymphatics accompany the larger airways and, with  careful examination, can be found in their walls.      EXERCISE: Blood vessels may be found on slides of all organs;  try the spermatic cord, slide 76.      STUDY QUESTIONS      For each of the vessels in the list, match its characteristics  from the panel beneath.

The arterial vessels usually  have a thicker wall in relation to their diameter than their companion  branches of the venous system. Identify the cellular components of the  layers and assess their relative proportions in each layer.        Arterioles have slightly larger diameter than capillaries and a thicker wall. They  usually possess an internal elastic membrane , which  is separated from the endothelium by a very thin layer of connective  tissue. The internal elastic membrane is usually not fully distended.  It appears wavy and homogenous-staining, often giving the  lumen a scalloped appearance. This is due to contraction of the smooth  muscle in the arteriole wall. Arterioles have one or two layers of  smooth muscle cells. The companion venules of arterioles are of  larger diameter, have only a few smooth muscle cells in the tunica media  and no internal elastic membrane. Because venules lack large amounts of  smooth muscle they may often appear collapsed or be filled with pooled  blood.      Muscular arteries and veins are a class of blood vessels of various  sizes. Muscular arteries have between 3-40 concentric layers of smooth  muscle. The smaller diameter arteries (3-30 layers of smooth muscle) run  with companion vessels known as small veins whereas the larger muscular arteries (30-40 layers)  run with companion vessels known as medium veins. Note the thicker wall  of the artery and the presence of both internal and external elastic  membranes. The wall of the vein is much thinner in relationship to the  diameter of the vessel and it has no internal elastic lamina or external  elastic lamina.      Lymphatic vessels are extremely thin-walled and difficult to  visualize either grossly or histologically. The lymphatic vessels start  out as blindly ending lymph capillaries, which have thinner wall and are  larger in diameter than blood capillaries. Their endothelium allows  passage of molecules too large to be transported into blood capillaries.  For example, lipids are transported into lacteals , which are  lymph capillaries in intestinal villi (see below slides 58 and 60), and  proteins are taken up from the connective tissue compartment. These  substances, together with extracellular fluid taken up from the  connective tissue and cells produced by the lymphatic tissues and  organs, comprise the lymph. Lymph is filtered through lymph nodes and ultimately are contributed to the blood circulation, primarily through  communications with the large veins at the base of the neck.     Although lymph capillaries are abundant and larger than blood  capillaries, their walls are so thin that they easily collapse. It is  often impossible to distinguish them from clefts in the tissue section.  Larger lymphatics , well endowed with  valves, accompany blood vessels, so that typically arteries, veins and  lymphatics travel together. However, even larger vessels may be  difficult to identify because their walls are thinner and less well  organized than those of either veins or arteries. The best way to  identify lymphatic vessels is the presence of lymphocytes and precipitated lymph inside  the lumen, but absence of RBCs that are found in the accompanying vessels of the  blood system.      B. Elastic Arteries. Slides 25 and 32     Large arteries have abundant elastic tissue in their tunica media.  Compare the H&E stained section of a human aorta   (slide 25) and a section of human pulmonary artery stained  for elastin (slide 32). In the H&amp;E preparation the circularly  arranged fenestrated elastic membranes of the tunica media appear as  wavy bands of yellow or pink refractile material between the layers of smooth  muscle cells. In the preparation stained for elastin they are stained  brown to black. A few of your boxes may have a newer slide 25 that has  been stained to show both elastin (black) and muscle (pink). Keep in  mind that the companion vessels to the elastic arteries would be the  large veins like the vena cava and brachiocephalic vein.  These large veins do possess an internal elastic lamina. Consult your  atlas and the chart in this chapter for other characteristics.      C. Heart: Aortic and Atrioventricular Valves. Slides 30*, 31*, 29,  and 34     Using either an inverted ocular or by eye, orient yourself on slides 30  and 31 by comparing your slide to the accompanying diagram ( CS-8 ) of these sections. In the wall of the  ventricle identify the endocardium (faded, very pale staining), myocardium and   epicardium . The latter includes adipose tissue in which you may  find branches of the coronary vessels, the coronary nerve plexus and  some terminal ganglion cells.     Slide 30 shows the aortic semilunar valve at the junction between the  aorta and the left ventricle. The aorta is cut in longitudinal section.  Smooth muscle cells, stained bright red, are seen in cross section.  Elastic fibers are paler pink to orange while collagen is blue.     Slide 31 shows a section of the left atrium and left ventricle with one cusp  of the mitral valve . Look for coronary  vessels in epicardium. Many slides lack a section of the coronary  vein. The coronary artery has a thick tunica intima containing  longitudinally-oriented smooth muscle cells (seen as red dots in cross  section). Such intimal thickening is a part of the aging process.     Review slides 29 and 34 for cardiac muscle structure, including Purkinje cells (slide 29)..      D. Miscellaneous aspects of the circulatory system      Whole mount of mesentary. Slide 100     Remember that there are two types of slides 100, one sained with Giemsa, the other for elastin. In the Giemsa stained slides 100, medium-sized arteries and companion  veins are seen in toto . Arteries are dark blue due to the  thickness of their wall. The nuclei of smooth muscle cells in the  tunica media are perpendicular to the long axis of the vessel,  reflecting their circular arrangement. Veins appear red due to the red  blood cells in the lumen, seen through their thinner walls. Lymphatics are recognizable by their large diameter and very thin walls, through which valves and lymphocytes may be seen. Lymphatics also have a bulbous appearance where the valves are located. In the  slides 100 stained for elastin, the blood vessels cannot be seen very  well.     Examine the periphery of the whole mount for capillary loops . Size is the  best criterion, approximately the diameter of one red blood cell. Larger  diameter, simple endothelial-lined tubes are probably venules.  Arterioles have one or two layers of smooth muscle cells.      Lacteals. Slides 58 and 60     Slide 58 is from the small intestine of a monkey fed a fat-rich meal.   Fats are absorbed by lacteals and in this slide the distended lacteals  or lymphatic capillaries appear as empty spaces, lined by endothelium, in the very cellular loose connective  tissue underlying the intestinal epithelium. Their empty appearance is due to the extraction of the fats during tissue preparation. Compare  the appearance of the lacteals in slide 58 with those in slide 60 where lacteals are collapsed.      Microvasculature. Slides 113, 125, 65, and 117 ( See diagrams on CS-6 )     In slide 113 abundant small blood vessels (capillaries, arterioles and  venules) are clearly seen in the connective tissue surrounding the  paraffin pellet.     Slide 125, a plastic section of the trachea or a large bronchus, has very  clear arterioles and venules in the connective tissue beneath the lining  epithelium.     Sinusoids can be seen in slide 65 of liver and slide 117 of spleen. They  are usually of larger diameter than capillaries and are lined by an  endothelium that may have phagocytic cells lying just outside of it. In the spleen, slide 117,  the sinusoids are filled with red blood cells, making them easy to  locate under low power. Here the endothelial cells are spindle-shaped  and oriented longitudinally.     In liver, the vascular spaces between the plates of hepatocytes can also be identified by the red blood cells within them. These sinusoids are lined in part by the phagocytic Kupffer cells, which  can be demonstrated by their ability to phagocytize vital stains such as  trypan blue (slide 65) or particulate matters, such as Ti0 2   (slide 111).      Variability of blood vessels. Slide 27     Blood vessels vary in structure depending upon their location and  functional requirements. For example, in the lung (slide 27) the pulmonary arteries accompanying bronchi have thinner walls  than might be expected for arteries of their diameter in the systemic circulatory system. The blood  pressure in the pulmonary arteries is lower than that in their systemic  counterparts of the same diameter. Pulmonary veins collect oxygenated  blood from alveoli and from the pleura. Pulmonary veins run alone in  the septa of the lung and have very thin-walls for their diameter.  Bronchial arteries accompany pulmonary arteries but do not extend beyond  the respiratory bronchioles. Bronchial veins are present only in the  hilus of the lobes. Lymphatics accompany the larger airways and, with  careful examination, can be found in their walls.      EXERCISE: Blood vessels may be found on slides of all organs;  try the spermatic cord, slide 76.
