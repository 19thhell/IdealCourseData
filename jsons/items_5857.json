McDevitt, PhD   Overview   The department has a long history of academic performance with contributions to all programs of the College. Biomaterials play a fundamental role in most dental diagnostic and restorative procedures. The department\u2019s programs are enhanced by a long history of funded research and an extensively equipped research suite for biomaterials development and characterization, much of it centered around new materials, biological models, calcium phosphate chemistry, and investigations on hard tissue architecture and regeneration.                    meet our faculty Read More                    MS Program in Biomaterials Read More                    shared scientific core resources Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   The department\u2019s educational and research role is enhanced by        the M.S. Degree Program in Biomaterials and Biomimetics, offered in        collaboration with the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science. This        provides the opportunity for dental graduate and postgraduate students        to work on a broad range of research projects in collaboration with        graduate students with materials and engineering backgrounds. The student        educational experience is also strengthened by interaction with visiting        scholars from other research institutions from around the world.                                                  First and Second Years                               The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics contributes to the undergraduate       dental educational program with lectures and laboratory exercises that       are integrated into freshman and sophomore General Dentistry Simulation       Programs to provide timely presentation of biomaterials course content.                                                                     Third and Fourth Years                               These first two years programs are then enhanced by presentations integrated        into the junior-year program covering the latest research findings and        the translation of these into new clinical techniques and restorative        and reconstructive philosophies. This requires close coordination with        the other clinical departments of the Division of Reconstructive and        Comprehensive Care and with the Division of Diagnostics, Infectious        Disease, and Health Promotion.                            RESEARCH   These projects involve high school students, dental students, postgraduate dentists, MS students, faculty, and visiting scholars and researchers.

The mission of the program is to provide education and training in biomaterials science and immersion in state-of the art technology, while ultimately contributing to improving human health through biomaterials-based treatment modalities.   The goals of this program are to:     Provide students with state-of-the-art knowledge and training in biomaterials science that will prepare them for careers in research and development in academia and industry   Enhance the students' understanding of biomaterials-based treatment modalities by providing them with a broad background in biomaterials structure, fabrication, function and interactions with cells and tissues   Serve as a basis for further advanced studies, e.g. Ph.D. programs in biology, physical and health sciences   Provide clinicians with the knowledge for materials selection and application     The department is located at the New York University College of Dentistry, a world-class craniofacial research and healthcare institution, and the largest dental school in the world. The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics is uniquely positioned to build upon its existing strengths in biomaterials fabrication, characterization, and testing to achieve the goal of the program and to bridge the gap between bench top research and clinical application. The Department will be moving to a new state-of-the-art facility in the new Nursing, Dentistry, and Biomedical Engineering Building located on First Avenue and 26th Street, to be completed in January 2015.   Overview of the Program   The program includes the study of basic material properties and structure of a full range of biomaterials used in medicine and dentistry. The biologic interactions of these materials related to their composition, surface, architectural features and function; and the methods employed to investigate structure, function, and biologic interactions are presented and explored.   Two degree options are available to the student dependent on their scholastic requirements.                                                  Thesis option                               The program represents a challenge to students in managing course work while designing and completing a thesis research project. Completion of the M.S. program in Biomaterials Science requires 36 credit hours of course work as well as completion and acceptance of a research thesis based on the student\u2019s original work. Of the 36 required credit hours, 2-6 credit hours may be approved for the student\u2019s research work. The time required to complete the program is not specified and will vary as it is affected by time commitment, motivation and the uncertainties of research. Most of the didactic portion of the program for full time students can be completed over approximately two regular semesters (one academic year). The research for the thesis will overlap with the didactic program. A full time student can complete the program, including research, in approximately two academic years   A part time student is encouraged to register for 6 credits a semester and could complete the program in approximately 3 years. Students must be in continuous enrollment during the period of their participation in the program, either by course registration or by the maintenance of matriculation registration (BIOM-DN.4747). All requirements must be satisfied within a period of 5 years from the time of original registration for courses.   The student is responsible for the selection of a mentor and for working with that mentor to develop a research protocol. The protocol must be presented to the faculty for approval before the research can commence. Students are free to propose their own research topic but final project selection must be approved by the faculty mentor and department. Constraints regarding feasibility, time, cost to the department, safety and regulatory issues, availability of materials, access to fabrication and investigation facilities, and mentor interest are all factors in project selection. The department will try to provide alternatives that are satisfactory to the student.                                                              Non-thesis option                               In lieu of a thesis the student will be required to conduct an Independent Project in Biomaterials.   Completion of the M.S. program in Biomaterials Science, non-thesis option, requires 40 credit hours of course work, 2 credit hours will be utilized for the student\u2019s independent project. The time required to complete the program is not specified and will vary as it is affected by time commitment, motivation. Most of the didactic portion of the program for full time students can be completed over approximately two regular semesters (one academic year). A full time student can complete the program, including research, in approximately two academic years.   A part time student is encouraged to register for 6 credits a semester and could complete the program in approximately 3.5 years. A student who is enrolled in an International Clinical program can take 5-8 credits in our program, and still complete both programs in two years if they are motivated to do so. Students must be in continuous enrollment during the period of their participation in the program, either by course registration or by the maintenance of matriculation registration (BIOM-DN 4747). All requirements must be satisfied within a period of 5 years from the time of original registration for courses.   The student is responsible for the selection of a mentor and for working with that mentor to develop an independent project. The protocol must be presented to the faculty for approval before the project can commence. Students are free to propose their own topic but final project selection must be approved by the faculty mentor and department.

McDevitt, PhD   Overview   The department has a long history of academic performance with contributions to all programs of the College. Biomaterials play a fundamental role in most dental diagnostic and restorative procedures. The department\u2019s programs are enhanced by a long history of funded research and an extensively equipped research suite for biomaterials development and characterization, much of it centered around new materials, biological models, calcium phosphate chemistry, and investigations on hard tissue architecture and regeneration.                    meet our faculty Read More                    MS Program in Biomaterials Read More                    shared scientific core resources Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   The department\u2019s educational and research role is enhanced by        the M.S. Degree Program in Biomaterials and Biomimetics, offered in        collaboration with the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science. This        provides the opportunity for dental graduate and postgraduate students        to work on a broad range of research projects in collaboration with        graduate students with materials and engineering backgrounds. The student        educational experience is also strengthened by interaction with visiting        scholars from other research institutions from around the world.                                                  First and Second Years                               The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics contributes to the undergraduate       dental educational program with lectures and laboratory exercises that       are integrated into freshman and sophomore General Dentistry Simulation       Programs to provide timely presentation of biomaterials course content.                                                                     Third and Fourth Years                               These first two years programs are then enhanced by presentations integrated        into the junior-year program covering the latest research findings and        the translation of these into new clinical techniques and restorative        and reconstructive philosophies. This requires close coordination with        the other clinical departments of the Division of Reconstructive and        Comprehensive Care and with the Division of Diagnostics, Infectious        Disease, and Health Promotion.                            RESEARCH   These projects involve high school students, dental students, postgraduate dentists, MS students, faculty, and visiting scholars and researchers.

The mission of the program is to provide education and training in biomaterials science and immersion in state-of the art technology, while ultimately contributing to improving human health through biomaterials-based treatment modalities.   The goals of this program are to:     Provide students with state-of-the-art knowledge and training in biomaterials science that will prepare them for careers in research and development in academia and industry   Enhance the students' understanding of biomaterials-based treatment modalities by providing them with a broad background in biomaterials structure, fabrication, function and interactions with cells and tissues   Serve as a basis for further advanced studies, e.g. Ph.D. programs in biology, physical and health sciences   Provide clinicians with the knowledge for materials selection and application     The department is located at the New York University College of Dentistry, a world-class craniofacial research and healthcare institution, and the largest dental school in the world. The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics is uniquely positioned to build upon its existing strengths in biomaterials fabrication, characterization, and testing to achieve the goal of the program and to bridge the gap between bench top research and clinical application. The Department will be moving to a new state-of-the-art facility in the new Nursing, Dentistry, and Biomedical Engineering Building located on First Avenue and 26th Street, to be completed in January 2015.   Overview of the Program   The program includes the study of basic material properties and structure of a full range of biomaterials used in medicine and dentistry. The biologic interactions of these materials related to their composition, surface, architectural features and function; and the methods employed to investigate structure, function, and biologic interactions are presented and explored.   Two degree options are available to the student dependent on their scholastic requirements.                                                  Thesis option                               The program represents a challenge to students in managing course work while designing and completing a thesis research project. Completion of the M.S. program in Biomaterials Science requires 36 credit hours of course work as well as completion and acceptance of a research thesis based on the student\u2019s original work. Of the 36 required credit hours, 2-6 credit hours may be approved for the student\u2019s research work. The time required to complete the program is not specified and will vary as it is affected by time commitment, motivation and the uncertainties of research. Most of the didactic portion of the program for full time students can be completed over approximately two regular semesters (one academic year). The research for the thesis will overlap with the didactic program. A full time student can complete the program, including research, in approximately two academic years   A part time student is encouraged to register for 6 credits a semester and could complete the program in approximately 3 years. Students must be in continuous enrollment during the period of their participation in the program, either by course registration or by the maintenance of matriculation registration (BIOM-DN.4747). All requirements must be satisfied within a period of 5 years from the time of original registration for courses.   The student is responsible for the selection of a mentor and for working with that mentor to develop a research protocol. The protocol must be presented to the faculty for approval before the research can commence. Students are free to propose their own research topic but final project selection must be approved by the faculty mentor and department. Constraints regarding feasibility, time, cost to the department, safety and regulatory issues, availability of materials, access to fabrication and investigation facilities, and mentor interest are all factors in project selection. The department will try to provide alternatives that are satisfactory to the student.                                                              Non-thesis option                               In lieu of a thesis the student will be required to conduct an Independent Project in Biomaterials.   Completion of the M.S. program in Biomaterials Science, non-thesis option, requires 40 credit hours of course work, 2 credit hours will be utilized for the student\u2019s independent project. The time required to complete the program is not specified and will vary as it is affected by time commitment, motivation. Most of the didactic portion of the program for full time students can be completed over approximately two regular semesters (one academic year). A full time student can complete the program, including research, in approximately two academic years.   A part time student is encouraged to register for 6 credits a semester and could complete the program in approximately 3.5 years. A student who is enrolled in an International Clinical program can take 5-8 credits in our program, and still complete both programs in two years if they are motivated to do so. Students must be in continuous enrollment during the period of their participation in the program, either by course registration or by the maintenance of matriculation registration (BIOM-DN 4747). All requirements must be satisfied within a period of 5 years from the time of original registration for courses.   The student is responsible for the selection of a mentor and for working with that mentor to develop an independent project. The protocol must be presented to the faculty for approval before the project can commence.

their self-assembly into novel materials. Besides being a \u201cgreen solvent\u201d supercritical CO 2 offers several unique physical properties such as low ultra-low surface tension, low viscosity, and tunable polarity that are ideally suited for fabrication of nanoscale building blocks. We design processes that take advantage of these properties to fabricate a broad variety of nanostructures from a range of materials. Specifically, we have developed a modified RESS process to create stable molecular clusters of organic molecules and a Sc-CO 2 based nebulization process for the creation of nano-scale wires and 3-D meso-scale porous structures for a large class of inorganic materials and alloys.
