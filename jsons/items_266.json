Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access    :      The     scope of the topics and materials . Each kind of    social inequality \u2013 such as class or gender \u2013 has distinctive dynamics and    each concrete instance of inequality has historically and culturally    specific characteristics. Yet, all social inequalities also share    critical common effects and requirements for persistence. For    example, all social inequalities produce legitimating ideologies, all    must curb resistance, all have to transfer the unequal resources and    positions to new generations, all produce divergent interests. To    understand a structural characteristic of some kind of inequality \u2013 such    as legitimation processes in a class system or violence in gender    inequality \u2013 we want to recognize that they represent a combination of the    dynamics common to most inequality systems and the specific    characteristics of that type of inequality. The topics below    pursue a series of fundamental questions about social inequalities,    seeking to investigate the general dynamics of inequalities, comparing    these dynamics across different types of inequality. Examples of    these topics include: what are the roles of interests in various kinds    of inequalities, how is inequality sustained across generations, what    processes induce conformity among both the advantaged and disadvantaged,    what mechanisms prevent rebellion, and what decides the intensity of    inequalities?     The readings represent the core of the stratification field in    sociology, the materials that sociologists working in this area expect    other others in the area to know, plus materials needed to pursue    important analytic issues under represented in the field.      The class     organization and goals . The class is intended for both    beginning and advanced graduate students. Critical    requirements for taking this course are a strong interest in inequality    and a commitment to the class project of investigating new ideas.     In this class, each week's activities will be organized around an    analytical task, as well as a set of readings. Rather than    focusing on discussion of the readings, the analytical tasks involve    attempting an analysis of inequality related to the week's issue,    building on the materials we read (in brief papers of 2-3 pages).     While mastering the existing research and theory is obviously a    prerequisite to doing good work, the approach in this class seeks to    develop analytical skills as well as understandings of the literature by    stressing actual analyses of inequality rather discussions of the    literature.     The course readings stress the foundational sociological literature on    inequality. Each week we will all look at some common    readings. The course guide will also point toward a range of other    recommended and related readings for further study for each topic -    students are not expected to read these optional materials as part of    the course. The recommended and related readings represent what a    student seeking to specialize in this area might read. Students in the    class are encouraged to scan these optional lists each week and look at    any pieces that seem particularly valuable or interesting.     All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our    class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'    efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will    adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our experiences    over the class. Every week, students will initiate discussions on    readings and papers. To see the discussant responsibilities for    each week, go to:      http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/analysis.of.inequality/Discussants.html         The readings below (the recommended and related readings as well as    the common readings that are the basis of the course) are almost all    available online \u2013 simply click the links to get to the articles.     For convenience, some readings are selections (excerpts from articles or    books) that appear in two printed collections that are now available    online: articles with \"[Grusky \u2013 Classic]\" appended to the listing are    from Inequality: Classic Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender ,    2006, eds. David B. Grusky and Szonja Szel\u00e8nyi; articles with \"[Grusky -    Contemporary]\" appended are from Inequality Reader: Contemporary     &amp; Foundational Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender , 2006,    eds. David B. Grusky and Szonja Szel\u00e8nyi \u2013 for most of the selections    from these readers, alternative citations and links are also provided    for the original publication or an appropriate alternative. Note:     Links for all readings will appear in the online version of the course     guide.      A note on the \"hidden\" material     below : Each section of this guide includes \u2013     beside the common readings \u2013 three subsections, one for an analytical     task , one for recommended readings , and one for related     readings . To simplify navigating through the course guide,    only the headings for these subsections are initially visible. The    content of all these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning    appearance of the page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the    viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then its contents will    appear. While this organization is helpful for negotiating the    page most of the time, it can become an obstacle if we want to search    the page (for example, for a particular article) as searches will ignore    the hidden material. To overcome this limitation, it is possible    to show all the hidden sections by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top     of the page (and simply reload the page to    collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their usual look). The table    of contents at the top of the page will still work to aid speedy    navigation to any section.                The Topics         I.

How can we conceive of and talk about social inequality in ways that are    general enough to apply across the range of relevant phenomena, consistent    enough to minimize conceptual ambiguities, and precise enough to be    analytically effective? Inequality is ubiquitous. People are    unequal in every conceivable way in endless circumstances, both immediate    and enduring, by both objective criteria and subjective experience.     So, what counts as social inequality ? Can we characterize it    in ways that let us confidently and impartially assess when there is more    or less of it?          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: What is social inequality ?       We often think that the meaning of social inequality is      self-evident or easy. Perhaps it is when we focus on extreme      versions of the more obvious forms of social inequality, such as      the rich compared to the poor. But, equally, perhaps it is      not when we consider inequalities that are subler or more      complex, such as those based on sexual preference or ethnic      identity or between nations. We want to begin by looking a      little deeper into our conceptualization of social inequalities.       Choose two kinds of inequality . For each kind of      inequality, consider an example showing a high degree of      inequality and another showing equality or a minimal amount of      inequality. Here we are simply trying to conceive a simple 2      x 2 table, showing two kinds of inequality and two levels of      inequality for each kind. This is the simplest design for      doing social analyses, whether that analysis is empirical or      theoretical. (Note: It is fine to use standard, commonly      discussed kinds of inequality, but being original and creative      about kinds of inequality to consider is also good.)       Describe (briefly) how the relevant groups are unequal for      each type. For each of these two kinds of inequality,      try to list the main ways that those affected are      unequal. For now, do not worry about why       such inequality exists. For now we are concerned with what      we mean by inequality, not what causes it. Try to specify      the crucial experiences, opportunities, or other circumstances      that distinguish the beneficiaries of the inequality from those      who are disadvantaged. Consider also the relationships      between the disadvantaged and advantaged, both direct and      indirect. (The idea of \" indirect relationships\"      refers to ways that the advantaged or disadvantaged influence the      circumstances or actions of those who are differently situated      without direct interaction, e.g. by controlling government      policies or creating a culture of fear.) In short, for each      of the two types of inequality, what induces us to call one      example high inequality and another low?       A final question . After working through the      questions above, try to complete a definition sentence beginning \"In      general, social inequality exists when ... .\" The goal      of this sentence is to provide a definition of social inequality      general enough to embrace the range of social inequalities but      also precise enough to distinguish social inequality from its      absence. The implicit strategy is compare what social      inequality means for the two chosen examples, then to try to      identify the common conditions that make them (and other forms)      all merit being called \"social inequality\" (distinguished from the      characteristics specific to certain types of inequality or      concrete historical and cultural conditions). To do this      involves not only the empirical comparison, but the appropriate      conceptual abstraction.       For the ambitious (to develop a       deeper grasp)...              Here are some other issues that you       might integrate into your initial assessment of inequalities               Vantage points . Might       some people (scholars, political actors, others) disagree       that any of the components you identify should really be       considered inequality ? If so, why?        (The goal here is to think through the reasons that people       disagree about what should be called inequality?)        Try to figure out how we might measure         the amount of inequality. Of the ways that you       have listed people being unequal, select which of these       differences seem most important. What might be       reasonable ways to measure each identified facet       of inequality? For each kind of inequality you have       selected an example where inequality is high and another       where it is low. Can you think of a measurement       procedure that will allow one to look at any society or       group and determine if some aspect of inequality is high,       medium, or low? Focus on realistic means that could be       applied in research, that could be used for the same aspects       of inequality when they apply to other kinds of       inequality. Do this only for the two or three facets       of inequality in your examples that seem most decisive.               For each of the two types of       inequality, if we put aside differences in the circumstances       of advantaged and disadvantaged people, what important       differences in social organization distinguish societies (or       other social groupings such as communities or organizations)       where that type of inequality is high from those where it is       low? The goal here is to consider if societies (or       other levels of social organization containing inequality)       that have high levels of some type of inequality       consistently differ from societies that have low levels, in       ways other than the difference in the level of this kind of       inequality.        Most people responding to the       prompts above will think about inequality between kinds of       people. Consider two other important concerns.        First, inequality may be between positions rather than       people (this is a critical concern which we will address       later). Second, inequality may concern \"units\" other       that people, such as families or organizations or nations.                                       Common Readings          David B.

What are common forms of social inequality?     What is the range of social inequalities that we should be addressing?    Pundits, scholars, and ordinary people usually focus on the couple    forms of inequality they experience as most troubling. Contemporary    sociology's sometimes blinkered perspective is reflected in the many    readers and texts on race, class, and gender. The range of analytically    relevant inequalities is considerably wider.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task : This week's task is to identify      major forms of inequality in two societies. The goal      is to see the range of inequalities that exist in      different societies. The remainder of this task description      just tries to show how to approach this systematically.       To start, choose two societies with which you have some      familiarity. It is fine to use this society or an another      society in which you have lived as one example (but it is an      interesting challenge to use two societies you have not      experienced). The two societies can be from two different      parts of the world or from different points in time. The      main goal is to use two societies that differ significantly in      their structure and culture, regardless whether those differences      reflect location, culture, historical circumstance, or something      else.       For each example (society), identify the significant,      widely-present forms of social inequality that persist      over time.              \"widely present\" means not limited to certain locations nor       small parts of the population; note that many instances of       inequality that are limited to particular places or subgroups       are, however, examples of some more generally defined kind of       inequality, so moving to a higher level of generality or       categorization identifies a widely present inequality of which       they are specific examples        two or more instances of inequality with a similar system or       structure but involving different populations should usually       be considered to of the same kind (e.g., similar ethnic       inequality processes or structures may apply to Hindi and       Chinese minorities)        The aim here is not to see how long the list of inequalities       might be, but we do want to see how diverse the forms of       inequality can be, and to consider if important kinds of       inequality are overlooked.                   Try to describe briefly each form of inequality       identified (for each society), by indicating:             to what degree is the inequality more a continuous gradation       (like years of age) or more a division into distinct       categories (like employed vs. unemployed)        what is unequal, that is what are the assets, opportunities,       capacities, relationships, or whatever that define the       inequality by their unequal distribution (this is not        what explains the inequality, but simply what is       unequal); this is self-evident for some kinds of inequality,       but not for others.        who is advantaged and who disadvantaged; in       essence, this asks how are the advantaged people different       from the disadvantaged people not only in the advantages that       define the inequality, but in other ways as well (e.g. for       ethnic inequalities, the groups are, in theory, defined by       ethnic identity [although ethnicity is tricky]; distinguishing       characteristics for some kinds of inequality might be more       difficult to characterize, and could, in theory, not exist if       placement is random)        [ optional \u2013 how do the disadvantaged and the       advantaged perceive the inequality?; do they have similar or       different conceptions of what is unequal, why they are       disadvantaged or advantaged, whether it is fair, and the       like?]                   In short , for two societies, you are preparing a list      of outstanding inequalities, that gives the primary      characteristics of each kind of inequality. You could make      this either as two lists or as two simple tables.       Finally , having prepared a catalog of the primary forms      of social inequality in the two societies, how would you compare      the two societies with respect to their patterns of social      inequality? All we are looking for here are initial,      outstanding differences and similarities (note that similarities      are at least as important as differences). To be clear, we      are just looking for an initial impression \u2013 a comprehensive      comparison would be a major project, obviously far beyond our      scope.             If this aspect of the analysis seems baffling, overwhelming,       or obscure initially, consider the following questions.        Does the overall amount of inequality seem greater in one       society than the other or similar or does this seem impossible       to guess? Do the structures of the societies or their       potential for change seem to be dominated by different or       similar inequalities? Does inequality overall seem more       rigid in one society than the other? Do major forms of       inequality seem to overlap a lot, or are they distinctive and       rather independent from each other? Is inequality more       continuous in one society and more categorical in the       other?                   For the ambitious with time to go       further:              How might we categorize the varied       forms of inequality discerned in the two societies into       groups defined by some notable similarities? For       example, if we have twelve types of inequality initially,       could we usefully fit them into two or three categories that       reflect their similarities (and differences)? Here are       some examples of criteria that might be used to categorize       inequalities:                Consider the processes        producing them         Consider who is advantaged and        disadvantaged         Consider how one form affects        the others         Consider their legitimacy claims                 Consider their histories                 Consider any other reasonable        logic you can conceive for grouping them, remembering        that a useful analytic taxonomy will usually rely on        some aspect of causation                      Do any of the forms of social       inequality seem more important to the structure and       organizational dynamics of a society than do others?        If so, why?

IV. What distinguishes legitimate from illegitimate    forms of inequality?     We often use the term inequality to refer only to forms of    inequality we consider unjust or otherwise undesirable. Yet, much    inequality is commonly accepted as appropriate, fair, or desirable in    societies. The amount of legitimacy attributed to a form of    inequality can be anywhere between extremely high (e.g. the authority of    parents over infants) to extremely low (e.g., slavery in a modern society    with well-developed civil rights). The assessment of    legitimacy should always consider potential differences among    differentially situated groups (e.g., those enjoying advantages in a    system of inequality, those disadvantaged, and those relatively    unaffected), and the degree of agreement or disagreement about legitimacy    assessments. Analytically, we want to ask what processes or    conditions cause a form of inequality to be considered more or less    legitimate. When does the legitimacy status of inequality change or    become contested?          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task : Using examples of two kinds of      inequality, consider what circumstances appear to foster or to      erode the acceptance of the inequality as legitimate.       First , select two kinds of inequality .       These can be from any place or time, but it might be simpler if      they coexist in the same society. They do not need to be      inequalities considered socially \"important.\" For each       kind of inequality, select one example or circumstance with      high \"legitimacy\" when those involved appear accepting or      complacent and another example or circumstance with      low \"legitimacy\" when those involved contest the      inequality. Thus you are considering four examples in all,      two that are uncontested, high legitimacy and two that are      contested, low legitimacy, based on the two types of      inequality. This is, once again, the simplest comparative      design for social analysis, essentially a two by two table, with      one direction being the two kinds of inequality and the other      being the two levels of legitimacy. (Whether an inequality      is perceived as legitimate and whether it is contested are not the      same, but we are simplifying for our current goals.)       Second , for each of the two kinds of inequality,      describe what are the principal arguments or claims offered       by the advantaged (or their representatives) to defend or      explain the system of inequality in the examples you have      chosen.              Look for arguments that respond to three common claims in       defense of inequality, that it is (1) just, (2)       necessary, and (3) beneficial to all.        Where possible, identify the general cultural beliefs or       symbols from which the arguments seek to gain acceptance or       weight, such as religious beliefs, science, or fear of       outsiders.                    Is it possible to distinguish between claims that seem to be       historically or culturally contingent and those more       fundamental to the particular kind of inequality?        [Explanatory note: If we compare organized religions we find       that all have practices and rituals for marriage. Many       of the specific rituals are artifacts of the historical       conditions in which they emerged, and would just as       effectively if they were different. Some aspects of       these practices, such as significant property exchanges (e.g.,       bride price) may reflect functional needs of the prevailing       economic and kinship system, although their concrete       manifestation can vary. Some even more general aspects,       such as requirement of marriage to identify kinship       relationships of children may reflect fundamental requirements       for the functional order of any kinship system. Claims       about inequality can similarly be categorized from the       historically arbitrary to those that seem unavoidable.]                   Third , when describing the legitimacy claims, consider      if the claims when the inequality is contested differ from      when its acceptance is largely unproblematic. That is, for each of      the two kinds of inequality, what seems to distinguish the      examples where legitimacy claims succeed from those where they      fail?             When the disadvantaged seem to accept legitimacy claims,       which arguments appear to be convincing or acceptable to       them? Why do they accept these?        When the disadvantaged question and contest the legitimacy       of the inequality, what are the principal counter arguments       they use? Their counter arguments suggest how the       legitimacy claims are failing.                   In short , you are developing a description of the ways      that people try to legitimate two kinds of inequalities, comparing      examples where the legitimacy efforts succeed with examples where      they do not. The goal is not to explain the range of these      claims or when they succeed, but to get a first level sense of      what legitimacy claims are and why they are important.       Finally , in response to the preceding analysis you have      developed of legitimacy claims regarding four examples of      inequality (based on two types of inequality), try to state      three general hypotheses about legitimacy claims, the role      of legitimacy, or conflicts over legitimacy in systems of      inequality. Elaborate each of these hypotheses just enough      that we can understand what they mean and what motivates      them.              These are hypotheses , which means they are not       theories and not claims we can defend. Rather, we can       think of them as informed speculations about what might be       true. They are ideas worth researching or worth thinking       about if trying to develop a theory about the legitimation of       inequality. Essentially, this is asking what ideas       spring to mind as a result of doing the empirical comparisons       in this task.

What is the critical distinction between positional    inequality and status inequality?     To put it simply, positional inequality refers to inequalities    between \"positions\" such as the different levels in an organizational    hierarchy (e.g., president, divisional manager, supervisor, clerk).     These locations give their advantages and disadvantages to the people who    circulate through them. Status inequality refers to social    advantages and disadvantages that adhere to categories of people without    regard to the positions they hold (such as race). Grasping the    differences between these two \"types\" of inequality and the relationships    between them is crucial for analytic clarity. (This distinction has    some similarity to the common contrast between achieved status and    ascribed status, but it is analytically different. Our distinction    stresses the way inequality is socially organized while the    achieved/ascribed concepts refer to the ways people acquire a    characteristic.)          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: How do positional and status      inequalities differ and how are those differences important?       Select two examples of positional inequalities and two      examples of status inequalities . The examples may be two      fundamentally different kinds of positional (or status) inequality      or they may be two distinctive instances of the same kind of      inequality appearing in different societies (e.g., racial      inequality in a plantation economy and racial inequality in a      market economy). It will probably be easier to use four      reasonably concrete examples (such as contemporary racial      inequality in Britain). Using more general categories (such      as racial inequality in market economies) is a more ambitious      strategy.             As usual, for each type of inequality, clearly describe who       are the advantaged and the disadvantaged and how they are       unequal.                   Enumerate the characteristics that distinguish the two      examples of positional inequality from the two examples of      status inequality . To put it differently, in what ways are      both examples of positional inequality different from both      examples of status inequality? Examples of things to      consider include (but should not be limited to):             homogeneity of people sharing similar standing (i.e., level       of [dis]advantage)        intergenerational rigidity (likelihood of having same       standing as parents)        ways that people's standing may improve or decline over time              diffuseness of impact on people's lives (i.e., what       proportion of people's time, activities, and relationships are       highly influenced)        legal status and government role in regulating, preserving,       or challenging the inequality        legitimation processes (content of the justifying ideology,       who or what promotes the legitimacy)        historical roots of the inequality structure                   For each difference you identify above between the positional      and status inequalities, please             briefly describe how the positional and status inequalities       seem to differ with respect to this characteristic, and,        if you can, suggest what might explain the difference (or,       to put it differently, suggest why you would expect this       difference to distinguish other examples of status and       positional inequalities).                   In short : We are making an initial effort to      identify general ways that systems of positional inequality differ      from systems of status inequality. The goal is to produce a      list of plausible differences, and to get a first sense of what      form these differences will take and why they appear.             note that we are again using a very basic \"research design,\"       comparing two examples of positional inequality with two       examples of status inequality; this is the simplest possible       design for trying to identify differences between two       categories (as we must have at least two examples of each       category to make the simplest control for other sources of       variation among the phenomena being categorized, in this case       instances of social inequality)                   Finally : Based on the differences you enumerate and      explore from your examples, what hypotheses do you have about      general differences between positional and status inequalities?

VI. How do we understand \"honor\" status hierarchies,    that lack apparent material bases?     Academia is one good example of a well-developed system (or systems) of    honorific inequality. High school peer groups are often good    examples of short-lived patterns of reputational inequality. The    idea of celebrity is usually associated with unequal prestige. The    key to honorific inequalities is that people compete for recognition and    deference, rather than material goods, power, or opportunities.     Purely honorific inequality structures are rare, as the pursuit of    prestige is commonly intermingled with materialistic inequities. The study    of honor and prestige systems (other than in the specialized form of    occupational prestige) is underdeveloped in sociology. Theoretical    works recognize its significance, but most treat honorific inequality as    both causally derivative and of marginal importance when compared to    economic and political inequalities. While prestige and honor are    elusively intangible, we are likely to misunderstand any type of    inequality if they are ignored.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: What do non-material      inequalities of honor or prestige look like in practice and what      is the logic of their processes?       Select two (or more) examples of honorific inequality      systems , where people \"compete\" directly for recognition,      respect, and deference. Such systems often include income and      power rewards. But we are looking for forms of inequality      where honorific status is central. Here are several      reasonable identifying characteristics to consider:             Does honor (or prestige or the like) motivate competition       for desirable locations as much as does power or material       rewards?        Is deference to others determined as much by their perceived       prestige as by their structural position, wealth, authority,       or the like?        In general, are honor or prestige acts at least as much a       cause of material rewards as it is a result of them?                   For each inequality system selected , try to      develop an analytical assessment of the way it works by responding      to these:             Identify and describe as well as you can what       conveys or is experienced as honor ; consider how it       looks both from within and from outside; think about ways that       the lives of those with more honor differ from the lives of       those with less; also, think about how we know which people       have more honor, or to put it differently, how we know to whom       we should defer and who should defer to us. (Think about       titles, awards, forms of dress, access to activities, and so       forth.)        Describe what people do to gain honor or to compete       for honor.        What decides the distribution of honor overall       within each system? Consider what processes and which       people decide who has more honor. Is it controlled from       the top or the bottom? Are people aware who decides the       outcomes?        What induces people to accept and conform        to the expectations of the prestige system? Why do they       defer to those who possess more honor? (Consider both       the carrots and the sticks.)                   Compare these systems of honor and prestige to       the systems of positional and status inequality we have      considered. Try to identify two or more important      differences and two or more important similarities,      explaining as best you can why you think each of these differences      and similarities exist.       In short , the aim of this week's task is to compare two      specific examples of honor inequality systems (and secondarily      compare them to inequalities where honor is secondary) to get an      initial sense of how honor inequality systems work.

How do people experience inequality and why do    these experiences matter?     Research on inequalities commonly treats experience as a simple effect    of inequality; interesting but secondary to theory and explanation.     Here we want to think of experience not only as a result, but also as a    potential ingredient to the explanation of inequalities. The    experiences of inequalities can serve as strong motivating forces at all    levels. The experiences also encompass not only the outcomes of    inequality, but all the processes that sustain or challenge it.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: How do lower-status and      higher-status people experience inequalities and their locations      within them? With what consequences for the systems of      inequality?       Select two systems of inequality : one in which      you have (now or in the past) been in a relatively low-status      location and another system in which you have been in a relatively      high-status location. The point here is to select systems in      which you have observational knowledge about the experience of      inequality. If possible, use a form of positional inequality      for one example and status inequality for the other, but it okay      if that is too much of a stretch given your biography.              As usual, briefly describe each system of inequality.        Who are included, what is unequally distributed, who are       advantaged or disadvantaged, and the like. If you are       going to consider a subset of a larger system of inequality,       be clear about what you are doing and why.        (OPTIONAL \u2013 To go further ... To       seek a more complete means of assessing experience, double       the examples, to consider two systems in which you have       experienced low standing and two in which you have had       higher standing, again representing both status inequality       and positional inequality if possible. This will give       you much more traction for seeing generalization       possibilities, but the time requirements may be more than       you can manage.)                   For each of these systems of inequality, try to characterize ,      briefly, how those in      high-status locations have different experiences than those in      low-status locations . This is not easy to do      well. Among other things, note that it is rarely obvious      which kinds of experiences matter more and it is difficult to      reduce the varieties of experience into a few categories that are      not arbitrary.       Focus on typ ical or defining       experiences. While experience seems inherently      individualistic because it is to such a degree private and      internal, the goal here is to move beyond the individual.       Systems of social inequality are comprised of socially organized      \"structures,\" processes, and cultural understandings. In the      search of a social analysis of inequality, we are looking for      common or shared experiences (understanding that these may be      shared unequally, so that there are alternative experiences common      to subgroups determined by other conditions, circumstance, or even      random variation). A good way to start is by thinking about      typical experience.       To make this effort more systematic and comparable, while trying      to assess differences in experience, here are dimensions you      might consider :             How much and in what ways do people recognize the inequality       and think about it? For example, people may                grasp the outlines of social inequality between groups        or positions         see themselves as being in unequal relationships, but        not have a conception of this as part of a larger pattern        of inequality (e.g., when women or men see themselves as        superior or inferior to the other sex, but do not perceive        there to be gender inequality)         people may not be able to conceptualize their experience        of an inequality as being inequality, but think of it in        different terms (e.g., believing it is not that \"they\" are        inferior or that \"we\" discriminate against \"them,\" \"they\"        are just different)                      in what way do people seem to perceive or talk about       fairness with respect to an inequality?               what sense of fairness do they have in their own        position?         and how do they think about the fairness of the        existence of inequality (of this sort)?                      how do the advantaged and disadvantaged have distinctive       experiences about what other people who share their standing       are like?               do the reference groups have different demographic        compositions (e.g. sex, ethnicity, age, class) apart from        the defining distinctions due to that inequality?         are their cultural differences in the ways people dress,        ways of talking, leisure activities, religiosity, or the        like?                      how do people perceive those at their level as different       from those at the other end of the inequality spectrum, and       how do they interact differently with them?               In particular, what, if any, are the common patterns of        deference when interacting with a previously unknown        person at the other end of the inequality spectrum?        (Most importantly, presumably, within the        institutional context embracing this form of inequality,        but also, potentially, in external contexts.)                      How do advantaged and disadvantaged people differ in general       ways that they experience the possibilities and realities of       life?               how do people experience ambition vs.        resignation?;         how do they differ in expectations for the future?         do they allocate blame for failures and credit for        successes (of the individual) differently?         do they have different orientations toward behavioral        tendencies such as violence, intimidation, manipulation,        cooperation, and subservience?         are there significant differences in religiosity?         do they seem to feel different loyalties toward the        institution surrounding the structure of inequality,        toward those in a similar location in the inequality        structure, toward those at a different level?         how do they differ in their trust in authority and        government?                      If you can, consider the implications of social mobility or       changing social standing for these experiences of       inequalities. That is, do people differ in their       experience of a location in a system of inequality depending       on how they got there?                Note that even people distinguished by locations in a        system of status inequalities may experience some form of        mobility. First, they may experience a shift in the        relative weight of the status inequality due to changes in        other status investing characteristics; an example        could be different meaning of race for affluent        blacks vs. poor blacks and affluent whites vs. poor        whites, where the analytical class difference may be        experience in terms of race. Second, the standing of        an entire status group or category may change over time;        consider, for example, the changes that have been seen by        middle-age blacks and whites in South Africa or women and        men in many countries.         Note that someone whose status appears unchanged may        experience it differently because the statuses of        significant others do change                      How do people differ in their experiences of being       advantaged or disadvantaged in the referent form of inequality       depending on their location in other important forms of       inequality? (For example, how does the experience of       being Native American differ between the highly educated and       the low educated?)                   In short , the goal of this task is to contrast the      experiences of being advantaged with those of being disadvantaged      under two different kinds of inequality. The goal is to      examine these differences systematically, and to consider their      causes and their consequences.       Finally , after completing work on the issues above,      considering the patterns of similarities and dissimilarities you      have discussed, can you devise any general hypotheses about the      experience of inequalities? That is, from the specific      patterns of differences you observe in your cases, what general      differences might you expect to find in other inequalities, in the      experiences of inequality, and in the causes and effects of those      experiences?

How should we conceive interests in the    analysis of inequality?     Almost everyone analyzing any system of inequality refers    to \"interests\" sooner or later, even authors who emphasize cultural    or normative explanations. Yet, interests usually receive casual,    unsystematic treatment. This casual reliance on interests builds on    two simple assumptions: (1) a range of relevant potential actions and    events will have differential consequences for people depending on their    location in a system of inequality and (2) anticipation or past    experiences of these consequences will influence peoples' actions.     From this starting point the considerations of interests take many routes,    considering objective and subjective interests, individual versus    collective interests, realistic compared to misconceived interests,    consistent versus inconsistent interests, contradictory and ambiguous    interests, and so on. Simply put, every theory of inequality relies    on a theory of interests (even if a negative theory).          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Interests       Select two examples of inequality; if possible, use one example      of positional inequality and one of status inequality.             Characterize who are the advantaged and who are the       disadvantaged in each example        As always, specify clearly what is unequal        If an example is not itself a system of inequality, but a       subsystem, a site where the effects of a system of inequality       are played out, or an intersection between systems of       inequality, then be clear what the relevant system or systems       of inequality might be                   For each example, examine the interests that seem to be      determined by the social organization of inequality, regardless      how people recognize them.             List the most important ways that the \"objective\" interests       of the advantaged are at odds with those of the       disadvantaged; here the objective interests means the       interests implied by the structure of inequality and their       location within this structure, regardless of their       recognition of the interests        Similarly, list the most important ways that the \"objective\"       interests of advantaged people or groups converge with       those of the disadvantaged. Here we are concerned with       interests related to conditions or practices that have a       widespread influence, usually where both the advantaged and       disadvantaged are exposed to common effects. For example,       potentially a shared interest between officials of an       autocratic government and the citizenry in maintaining public       peace would be relevant, but parallel or similar interests in       being healthy would not. Similarly, the employers and       workers in a corporation may have divided interests about the       distribution of the company's income, but they have convergent       interests in the corporation being successful.        For the above assessments, both the interests at odds and       those that converge, consider whether the objective interests       seem try to characterize the most important interests in terms       of their clarity, consistency, extremity, and the like.        thinking about objective interests not as an individual       experiences them, but as they are produced and sustained by       the systems of inequality, how would you ?                   Now, a really tough part. As best you can, with these      examples, consider how interests become recognized or conceived       by people who are subject to the interest-producing circumstances      of inequality.               We want to avoid the temptation to think about this in terms       of the reasons an individual might choose one way or       another. Instead, we want to examine how the       characteristics of objective interests or the structure of the       relevant inequality induces people to interpret their       interests in one way or another. We are seeking the       social conditions or dynamics that direct the conception of       interests.        Note to begin that people may conceive their interests as       some subset of the objective interests previously identified,       or they may rely on conceptions that ignore or even oppose the       objective interests.        What institutional and cultural processes or arrangements       seem to influence the emergence of common interests based on       the inequalities in your examples? E.g., the aged       or young adults may have a strong, self-conscious sense of       common interests under some circumstances but at other times       not recognize possible shared interests.; what determines when       they do see their concerns as common interests? Given       the objective interests you have identified, think under what       conditions you would expect people more likely to identify and       pursue each of those objective interests as opposed to the       conditions under which they would not do so. Similarly,       consider under what conditions people might be prone to       misinterpret their interests entirely. Or, under what       conditions they are more likely to stress oppositional       interests and under what conditions they will emphasize the       interests they have in common with those with whom they are       unequal?        For each example, in what important ways and under what       circumstances do people's conceived interests seem to diverge       from their objective interests? (A classic example       occurs when members of a group, such as the working class,       believe their interests are best served by a political party       that is actually committed to policies that threaten their       interests, such as those typically associated with       Republicans.) What seems to account for the       disjunctions? (Consider both the advantaged and the       disadvantaged.)                   For the inequalities you are using, when and where do individual      interests seem to contradict collective interests? What      consequences does this have? (E.g., it is generally      in students' collective interest that professors grade all      students the same way, but tall, pretty boys have individual      interests in biased grading if professors favor tall, pretty      boys.)       In short , the goal here is to develop some initial      ideas about the ways that interests work. We use two      examples as the simplest design that allows us to begin      generalizing about inequality, rather than describing the      character of a single instance. Using the chosen examples,      we want to produce some initial ideas about the range of objective      interests, both oppositional and shared, created by an inequality      system. Then we want to ask how people's conceptions of      their interests arise out of those objective interests in      interaction with impinging social conditions. And, in      particular we want to consider how and why conceived interests      might diverge from or even become inconsistent with objective      interests.

IX. What determines the allocation of people (or    other relevant unit) within a positional system of inequality?     This issue includes questions commonly addressed in the literatures    on social mobility and status attainment (and on placement within    organizations). More or less independent of its occupants, a system    of positional inequality has a static     \"structure\" characterized by the direct relationships of    authority and dependence between positions ; the ranking of    positions according to the rewards, authority, opportunities, and statuses    attached to them; and the demographic profile defined by the number of    positions of each type. A positional inequality system also has a dynamic     structure defined by the movement of people through it, both    within careers and between generations. These two components of    structure \u2013 the static and the dynamic \u2013 are linked by the selection    processes controlling access to positions. We can usefully conceive    positional inequality as the juxtaposition of two parallel systems that    are often confused or conflated: first, the structure of relationships    among the positions constituting the system of inequality (e.g., the    enduring authority relationship between a managerial position and a    line-worker position), and, second, the relations between the people who    occupy these positions (e.g., the interactions between managers and    workers). The patterns of people's movement between positions both    reflects and influences the relationships among positions, but it also    shows the impact of impinging status inequalities. To understand the    inequalities among people, we obviously need to understand what decides    which people occupy which positions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: We will explore how positional      inequalities work. Recall that two general examples of positional      inequalities would be the occupational structure of a modern      society or the hierarchy of positions within a complex      organization. Note that, in this analytical context, income      inequality is an effect of positional inequalities;      income inequality is not itself a system of inequality      (involving neither transferable positions nor status groups),      although it functions as both an incentive and consequence of      positional (and status) inequalities. Also note that positional      inequalities are commonly constituted by relatively clear \"local\"      hierarchies that only loosely translate into a societal wide      hierarchy. For example, complex organizations usually have      well-defined positional hierarchies, but their finer distinctions      are organization or industry specific. As a result, people      (both scholars and ordinary people) use common characteristics of      positions \u2013 such as income, authority level, or organizational      size \u2013 to translate \"local\" positional standings into a comparable      metric.       Choose two dissimilar examples of positional inequalities.       Try to choose two that have different institutional settings, are      not closely causally connected to each other, or operate by      different logics. They may coexist in one society or be      drawn from different (in space or time) societies.       For each example, describe the overall structure of      positions. Among other things, an analytical description of      a positional structure should consider the following:             Assess the differential characteristics attached to the       positions (rewards, authority, visibility, etc.)        Summarize and characterize the relationships among       positions.                    Consider the simple demographics of the system: how many       positions exist at each level?; what is the turnover rate of       personnel occupying the positions (the departure rates)?; how       stable is the demographic profile (i.e., do the relative and       absolute numbers remain the same over time)?        If possible to assess, how did the existing configuration of       positions come into existence?                   For each example, try to describe the \"normal\" pathways of      movement into and between positions             What are the typical initial entry points, the positions       that take people who have not previously been in the system of       positional inequality? For example, in a large business       or organization, many positions are typically filled by       promotions from other positions; people are not usually hired       from the outside for such positions. Commonly, a If these entry-point       positions are themselves unequal, also consider                How are the entry points unequal ?         What determines who gets in which ones?         Who controls the allocation process of the initial        positions (directly and indirectly)?                      What is the pattern of movement among positions within the       system?               To what degree does selectivity operate (the demographic        constraint)? (Among other things, this asks what        proportion of people at any given level will ascend to a        higher level.)         Consider if lateral movement among positions is relevant        to hierarchical movement.         Is there significant downward movement as well as upward        in the positional hierarchy? If so, remember        to examine downward as well as upward for all issues about        movement among positions.         What appears to decide who moves up into more desirable        positions (or down)?                  Is the determining process fairly consistent across         positions or does it vary by how high or in what         sector the position appears?          who has decision-making power?          how standardized or impartial are the processes         governing mobility among positions? Note that         impartiality can be the result of self-conscious         efforts to eliminate bias and reliance on         inappropriate criteria, but, alternatively, it also         can be the result of an uncontrolled process that is         inherently unbiased (as some would suggest for market         mechanisms)? Slave traders, for example, may be         just as impartial toward the ethnic divisions among         their chattel as the most progressive advocate of         meritocratic assessments.                                      How is the position-allocation process ideologically       conceived?;                particularly consider ideological constructs that        reinforce, obfuscate, legitimate, or challenge the        allocation process.         how are \"success\" and \"failure\" conceived (as moral and        practical categories)         are there competing ideological formulations of what        causes success and failure?                                 Taking into account all the above, comparing the two examples,      what can you say about the patterns of affiliation, alliance,      deference, patronage, avoidance, opposition, and conflict that      constitute the structure of relationships among people occupying      different locations in a positional inequality? While      exploring this issue, pay careful attention to the distinction      between the positions and the people occupying them.       In short , the goal of this task is to gain some insight      into the ways that positional systems of inequality work.       Using two concrete examples is the simplest possible design for      identifying some of the common characteristics of such      systems. A commonly unanticipated difficulty in analyzing      such systems arises from their duality: a structure of      relationships among the positions independent of the people who      occupy them and the dynamics of relationships among the people who      do occupy the positions.

X. What are the bases of actions that secure dominance    over time?     From those enjoying the most privileged positions to those suffering the    most disadvantages, people may believe that the system of inequality that    divides them reflects the elusively differential favor of the gods, the    cruel fate of nature's uneven treatment, or unavoidable results of    people's differential efforts and capacities. In truth, systems of    inequality require work to keep them going, particularly the efforts of    those in superior positions to preserve the shape of the system and their    positions within it. We cannot hope to grasp the logic of a system    of inequality until we understand what this work is and how it gets done.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Assess how and why advantaged      people (or their agents) act in ways that (1) preserve their      advantages and (2) preserve the system of inequality that gives      them advantages.       Select two examples of inequality to assess the actions of      advantaged people. The first example should concern gender      inequality \u2013 this may be an instance of gender inequality (e.g.,      gender inequality in an organization, or in an occupation, or in a      sport) or it may be gender inequality more generally (although      this may prove more difficult). The second example should be      a different kind of inequality, preferably an example of      positional inequality or alternatively an example of a quite      different form of status inequality.       For each example of inequality, the goal is to identify and      explain the kinds of actions by advantaged people that (1) seem to      occur consistently and (2) seem to reinforce their      advantages. To approach this problem systematically, try to      answer the following about each example of inequality:             How do the advantaged people treat disadvantaged people in       direct interactions; the relevant comparisons are with the       ways the advantaged relate to each other and the ways the       disadvantaged relate to each other?        How do advantaged people have different kinds of       relationships with other advantaged people than than they have       with disadvantaged people (this is similar to the previous,       but concerns the more general problem of relationships        rather than interactions )?        In what ways might common actions or behavioral patterns of       those in the advantaged \"class\" \u2013 actions that use or reflect       their advantaged circumstances \u2013 reinforce the privileges of       advantaged people, even though the actions are not aimed at       disadvantaged people or at sustaining inequality? (For       example, the advantaged might buy all unused land for golf       courses and expansive estates, leaving poor farmers no way to       expand their acreage for crops.)        How do advantaged people respond if one of them is       challenged by a disadvantaged person.                \"Challenges\" can take many forms. A member of a        subordinate group may simply refuse to show \"proper\"        deference, as when a lower caste person does not step        aside, a black woman does not go to her place in the rear        of a bus, or a member of the secretarial pool addresses        managers by their first name just as they do her.         Someone with lower standing may adopt the dress or        mannerisms of those with higher standing, or attempt to        move into their neighborhoods or schools. More        directly, someone with lower standing may reject and defy        efforts to exercise authority by those \"above\" them.         And so forth ....         Consider not only the actions of the person who is        directly challenged, but potential actions by others in        the advantaged class.                      How do advantaged people exercise power in government, over       laws, or in the economy in ways that benefit those with       advantages?        How do advantaged people respond if there is a collective       challenge to the system of inequality in which they have       advantages?                   Looking over the range of actions you identify as relevant      above, can they usefully be categorized? For example, one      might divide them into those that mainly benefit an individual's      status and those that mainly help sustain the system of      inequality. The goal here is to consider if there is an      analytically useful way to reduce the range of relevant actions      and behavior patterns into a small number of general types.       What within the system of inequality seems to organize and      ensure the actions that sustain it? For example, in the      simplest conceivable system of inequality, we might find the only      mechanism is the interests of those in dominance \u2013 they      individually act on those interests in a manner unmediated      by ideology, norms, relationships with others in the dominant      group, laws, organizational processes, or anything else.       More complex systems involve mechanisms that induce these actions,      giving individuals motivation, direction, and support.       Looking at the range of actions identified as relevant, what stand      out as the mechanisms that make such actions consistent and      effective?       What seem to be important limitations on the actions that secure      dominance? How are these actions constrained by laws, norms,      ideology, resources, or the like? What conditions or      potentials for the future might cause the actions to lose      enthusiasm or effectiveness?       In short , this task concerns the ways that inequality      systems induce advantaged groups to act in ways that sustain the      inequality (and their standing within that inequality). Once      again, using two examples is the simplest design to allow initial      speculations about the general functioning of inequality.       The questions above aim to help one to think systematically about      the range of possible actions and their sources.       When analyzing the actions of the advantaged (and      disadvantaged) as described above, keeping several considerations      in mind may help:             The shorthand references here to \"the actions of advantaged       people\" do not imply that all advantaged people act the same       way or that the actions that sustain inequality are produced       in the same way and at the same rate by all the       advantaged. Such actions may be nearly universal, they       may be typical but with a high degree of variation       across people and circumstances, or they may be the special       actions of a minority who are the key representatives of the       group interests.        The analytical focus should be on the processes and       circumstances that induce enough actions of sufficient       effectiveness by enough advantaged people to protect the       inequality system. An individualistic focus on the       motives or beliefs of people will probably go astray.        Note initially that the relevant actions of the advantaged       may differ from those of the disadvantaged in varied ways       other than reflecting divergent interests. For example,       (1) the opportunities to act may differ (e.g. differential       access to higher education), (2) analogous actions may       have different effects, and (3) even with equivalent       opportunities and effects, they may choose to act differently       (e.g. because they have different beliefs or respond to       different interests).

Inequality systems do not only have causes that bring them into    existence and causes that preserve them, they also have causes that    potentially reduce or eliminate them. Systems of inequality    may decline because they are pushed out of the way by new systems of    inequality, because they simply become increasingly ineffective or    irrelevant, because the disadvantaged are increasingly able to overcome    their circumstances as individuals, or because the system is dramatically    overturned by collective actions from below or intrusion from    invaders. How and why these processes dilute, undermine, or    eliminate inequalities is theoretically underdeveloped.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Declining inequalities       Select as example of social inequality, positional or status,      that showed significant reductions in the degree of inequality      over time.              For the selected example of inequality, if it is not a       system of inequality but a component, result, or instance of a       system of inequality, the analysis should include careful       consideration of the system itself.        (Note that inequality may decline in a component as a result       of overall decline in the system, decline in a component may       induce greater inequality in the system, or decline in a       component may take place independently of and without       noticeable impact of the enveloping system.                   In what ways did those involved in the example of inequality      being considered actively promote or resist its      decline?              In our simplest examples, \"those involved\" reduces to the       advantaged group versus the disadvantaged. In real life,       seems can be much more complex. Each system of       inequality may have multiple types of involvement,       distinguished by subtle or ambiguous differences of interests,       relationships and activities. And, systems of inequality       overlap and interact. We want to be sensitive to this       potential complexity, but willing to reduce it conceptually as       far as possible to produce a manageable model.        Note that people may actively promote or resist a change in       inequality for motives that are not focused on the issue of       the inequality's persistence.        The goal here is to characterize the types of people whose       actions tended to reinforce the inequality and those whose       actions tended to erode it. Recall that members of       advantaged groups may join the challengers (against their       putative interests) and members of the disadvantaged may join       the supporters.                   Were any other coexisting systems of inequality declining or      becoming more extreme during the same period? If so, is it      possible to identify causal processes that might connect the      simultaneous changes?       Were there direct clashes over the competing interests of those      advantaged and those disadvantaged by system of inequality that      was declining? If so, what were there causes and their      consequences?       Were there any independent changes in the circumstances of the      advantaged people that plausibly diminished their will or ability      to sustain the pattern of inequality?       Were actors who were not direct participants in the systems of      inequality (i.e. not acting as members of the advantaged or      disadvantaged) significant for promoting or obstructing the      movement toward change? The state is an obvious contender      here, but so are others whose interests or symbolic commitments      seem to be at stake.       Are there other processes, actors, circumstances, or causal      dynamics neglected by the above questions that seem important to      analyzing the changes in inequality in the examples being      considered?       In short , the goal this week is to explore the      conditions and processes that work against the persistence of      inequalities under appropriate structural and historical      circumstances.                    Common Readings          Karl Marx's theories of capitalism and societal transformation,     often simplified as the theory of historical materialism, is a     benchmark of all later theories aiming to explain changing systems     of inequality.

What are the theoretical and empirical    relationships between different forms of inequality?     Multiple systems of inequality coexist in societies, with crosscutting    categories and with individuals simultaneously located in each. An    older tradition in sociology suggested that the degree of overlap between    different forms of inequality was one condition influencing the likelihood    of class formation. A more recent interest has been the    \"intersection\" between race, gender, and class as experienced by    individuals, with the central (largely atheoretical) premise that the    implications of one's status in one system depends on one's statuses in    the others. Our concern here is more at the level of inequality's    organization, asking in what ways different systems of inequality interact    with each other.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Interdependence of inequalities            Select one society and historical moment (or one period, such as      the second half of the 20 th century). Within this      historical context, select two examples of systems of positional      inequality and two examples of systems of status inequality,      chosen such that a significant number of individuals will have a      location within each of the four systems considered. .       Assess in what ways and to what degree an individual's status in      one instance of inequality relates to others. To be systematic,      consider             How standing in one form of positional inequality relates to       standing in the other example of positional inequality        How standing in one instance of status inequality relates to       standing in the other form of status inequality        How standing in the systems of positional inequality relate       to standing in the systems of status inequality                   Assess how the organization and functioning of these systems of      inequality influence or overlap each other. Among other things,      this might include considering             How the \"locations\" in the two examples of positional       inequality are related. Are any locations defined       simultaneously in both systems? Are there enduring       relationships between locations in the two systems that       continue regardless who are in those locations? Are there       sustained patterns of movement between the two systems?        What relationships exist among the the symbolic       representations and ideological legitimation schemes       associated with the forms of inequality being examined?        Are they simply independent?; are they separate but drawing on       some common ideas?; are they partially or wholly merged into       one scheme that serves all at once?        In what ways is persistence of one system of inequality       dependent on its relationship with another? For example, how       might the elimination of any one system of inequality affect       the others.?        What links exist between the laws and governmental       mechanisms that support these systems of inequality?        Can we identify inconsistencies or sources of friction       between these systems of inequality?        How do historical developments and changes in these systems       relate to each other?                                Common Readings          Jerry A.

What causes inequality?     Perhaps the most fundamental question about inequalities, and sometimes    seeming the most illusive to answer, is the misleadingly simple question,    what causes inequality? While no general, all embracing answer is    possible (at this time), progress in understanding inequality demands that    we continually try to improve our analyses of the causes. Any effort    to do this must consider different forms of causation that are    possible.              Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: We want to investigate what      causes inequalities. Causation is a difficult, often      elusive, concept. What we mean by the causes of inequalities      can take different forms. We can ask why it comes into      existence. This question about origins may concern the      specific historical circumstances or sequence of events in which      an inequality emerges. Or we might interpret original causes      in terms of the social conditions necessary for such inequality to      emerge or, somewhat differently, the social conditions that make      it unavoidable. We might instead ask what causes (or allows)      an inequality to persist over time, potentially distinct from the      reasons for its origin, the conditions and processes that sustain      it. Or, we might focus on the variations in the severity of      some inequality, seeking the key to understanding it in the      conditions that cause it to be great in some places and slight in      others. In either case, we may stress the mechanisms, the      recurring actions and social processes that produce the      inequality, or we may stress the conditions that allow or require      it. Given this expanse of possibilities, we must narrow our      question, to make it reasonable.       Choose two kinds of inequality, each of which varies      considerably in its intensity. For each kind choose one      example that has low inequality and another that has high      inequality. These four examples, two with low inequality to      compare with two having high inequality, will be the basis of the      analysis. These may come from the same historical and      cultural setting or from different ones.             For each kind of inequality, if it is not a system of       inequality but a component, result, or instance of a system of       inequality, the analysis should stress the system.        For example, if we start with two unequal occupations, we       would say that they are in most cases not a system of       inequality but a part of one. So, we could shift our       attention to the system of occupational inequality. Or,       if we begin with the inequality between women and men within       the financial industry, we could move to the general       inequality between the sexes.        In general, an example of inequality that is a component,       result, or instance of a system of inequality may have       particularistic causes that seem sufficient to account for its       contours or variations. However, we expect its existence       is derivative of the relevant system of inequality and that it       and other similar instances that are derivative of the same       system of inequality are all subject to the causal processes       that generate and sustain that system of inequality.        Thus, an effort to identify and make sense of the causal       processes cannot look at the component or instance alone.                   Describe each kind of inequality and the difference between the      higher and lower inequality instances.             As always, describe who are distinguished by the inequality,       and what it is that is unequal.        Specify why we consider the inequality in one instance to be       significantly higher than in the other. This is a       measurement issue on the surface, but commonly has deeper       implications about what the inequality means.                   Comparing the instances of high inequality with those of low      inequality, construct a series of hypotheses about about the      possible causes of high inequality (compared to low      inequality). In some cases these hypotheses may apply to      both kinds of inequality similarly while in others they are quite      different \u2013 try to be clear about this. For each      hypothesis, explain the reasoning behind your speculation.       In attempting to generate hypotheses representing a systematic      analysis, among other things to think about, you might consider:             the origins of each example of inequality (e.g., do the high       and low inequality instances arise from distinctive conditions       that relate to their subsequent intensity)        the history of changes in levels of inequality if applicable       and known (e.g., does knowledge of their varying intensities       over time suggest anything about why or how they differ in the       instances you compare?0        political and legal contexts        ideological and cultural contexts        relationships to other forms of inequality        direct relationships between those advantaged and those       disadvantaged by the inequality        how individuals' statuses are decided        ... Each of the foregoing refer to important aspects of an       inequality system that imply the existence of some causal       process. Looking back over the previous topics we have       examined should give more facets of inequality calling for a       similar causal analysis.                   Moving beyond hypotheses, see which of these more general      questions you can begin to answer.              Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by the outcomes of       self-interested actions of individuals and organizations.        Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by its functional and       structural relationships to important social arrangements or       \"needs.\"        Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by some competitive       processes.        Try to be self-conscious about the comparisons being made,       implicit or explicit, and what alternatives might be possible.              Try not to forget that inequality induces processes,       conditions, and structures that limit resistance's       effectiveness and part of its explanation lies in the ways       this obstruction or resistance works.                   In short , our      analytical goal is to generate ideas about what produces      inequality, by first looking at what seems to explain variations      in the degree of severity of two types of inequality.

XIV. What makes some forms of inequality more    important than others to the organization of social structure and the    patterns of human action?     Some have argued that class dominates in particular societies or all    societies. Others have suggested that gender inequality is the most    fundamental inequality. Putting aside grand claims, most would agree    that some kinds of inequality have greater influence over the organization    of a society (or other social entity) and the history of that    organization. How we can systematically assess the relative    importance of different kinds of inequality and what decides their    differential importance are not clear.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: To be added       Select four kinds of inequality that are widespread within a      society or some other boundaried social context (such as an      organization or social category).       Try to rank these examples of in equality in terms of their      relative importance.             Note that different criteria for \"importance\" can result in       different rankings. One goal is to identify what       criteria for importance make sense for the chosen       examples.        Note that the importance of an inequality may vary by time       period, by type of people, by location in another system of       inequality, and other differentiating conditions.        Thus, a careful assessment will commonly result in a series       of rankings for the relative importance of the inequality       example, with the rankings distinguished by the criteria for       importance used and by the circumstances that mediate the       evaluations for any specific criterion.        To be systematic, one will usually want to rewrite the       analysis of relative importance organized around the       conditioning criteria                   Having assessed the relative importance of the inequality      examples, try to explore what caused the rankings. In the      foregoing, we are focusing on description and measurement.       Here the concern is causality. Above we are trying to      establish why and when we might call one kind of inequality more      important than another, a conceptual and empirical exercise.       Here we are asking what it is about the content, configuration and      history of the inequalities that results in one having more      importance than the other.             One path to answering this question might be to consider       known empirical examples where the relative importance of the       types of inequality being considered have a different ranking       importance.        Another path to answering might be to imagine what it would       take to lower the importance of the higher ranked inequality       or raise the importance of the lower ranked one.

How does resistance by subordinate groups work?     &amp;    People do not enjoy the lower status, fewer rewards, subjection to    authority, and other disadvantages attached to being at the lower end of    a system of inequality. This may result in anything between a    mild, occasional resentment and a continuous, burning hatred with    their fate. Fear, identification with the system, search for    praise from those above, or hope for personal advancement may induce    some to conform as much as possible with the expectations of the    advantaged. Still, wherever inequality exists, resistance    exists.          Analytical      Task                   Analytical task: Resistance       Select two examples of inequality. In each case, how do the      disadvantaged resist?       While identifying resistance, consider &lt;              everyday, commonly repeated actions of the disadvantaged        unusual, more extreme individual actions by some       disadvantaged        collective or organized forms of resistance                    What conditions, rules, processes, and actions limit      resistance? To recognize these obstacles, consider why the      identified forms of resistance are not more common, more      extreme, or more effective?

A system of inequality is a \"system.\" From a functionalist    perspective, its persistence requires mechanisms to ensure conformity to    its rules and expectations, to recruit adequate personnel to sustain    operation, to preserve commitment of those in advantaged statuses and    limit rebellion from others, and so forth. From a structuralist    perspective, it will induce latent conflicts that must be contained, it    will require legitimating ideology, it must enforce unequal effort and    unequal rewards, and so forth. A system of inequality has    structure, it has processes that occur over time, it has mechanisms to    sustain itself. Are there ways we can conceive these elements that    allow us to talk with a common language about the structural logics of    diverse systems of inequality?          Analytical      Task                  Analytical task .       Select and list five or more       distinctive systems of inequality . From each of      the past weeks in this class, select one system of inequality      from the weekly papers . The possibilities from which to      choose includes any system of inequality that appears in any of      the papers for a given week.       As usual, briefly describe each system of inequality.       Who are included, what is unequally distributed, who are      advantaged or disadvantaged, and the like. If you are      going to consider a subset of a larger system of inequality, be      clear about what you are doing and why.

What are general dimensions of inequality systems, by which we can    characterize, compare, and categorize them?     Generally, researchers and theorists treat different kinds of    inequalities as if they existed in distinct and unrelated    conceptual worlds, although they might empirically overlap in concrete    historical settings. Various empirical instances of racial    inequality are compared, as are different instances of income inequality    or organizational hierarchies, but divergent kinds of inequality each    get their own, independent analytic turf. The divisions between    \"kinds\" of inequality are not the result of any systematic logic, but    treated as self-evident, natural distinctions.

[part 2]     Continuing the analysis of interests.          Analytical      Task                   Analytical Task 2 on Interests       Taking into account the insights and concerns developed in the       Common Readings listed below, write a critical review of      Jackson's effort to use interests as a theoretical device and      analytical tool in the studies of class and gender inequality      listed above.                           How      to write a critical review                  Although scholars spend much time and effort writing critiques      of published work, and graduate students spend even more,      systematic treatments of the criteria for, and strategies      toward, good critiques are rare. Here are just a few points to      consider.        A critique can never be better than its author's      understanding of the work being criticized. And a reader      cannot appreciate the intent of the critique beyond their grasp      of the critic's reading of the original work. This means      that to write a good critical review, we must first be sure we      understand what we are criticizing and, second, we must present      a clear summary of that understanding as part of our critique.       Although there are important exceptions, most critical reviews      really are elaborations of the answer to a simple      question. After reading the piece, do I, the critic, find      the argument worthwhile or not? However elaborate or      simple, with whatever style of presentation, the review is      largely an effort to present a sustained defense of that      evaluation.       A good review is always fair. We should never shy from      identifying a flaw or calling a mistake what it is. But we      should always try to use the language and tone that we hope      reviewers will use when they reveal the similar failings in our      work.              We review manuscripts, articles, and books. We do       not review people. Brilliant scholars write dim       papers \u2013 they are not dim as a result. A wise reviewer       avoids referring to the author, and concentrates on the       strengths and weaknesses of the work being reviewed.        For example, saying that \"the arguments in the last and       first sections contradict each other\" is preferable to       saying \"in the last section, the author contradicts what she       said in the first section\". Attributing thoughts and       intentions to an author is worse. Sitting in judgment       of the author's intellect, effort, or morality is       worst.                      As reviewers, we commonly want to be clear about two       interpretations of what has been accomplished in the work       being reviewed: that of the author and that of the       reviewer. Sometimes these will be the same; often not.        A critic has no obligation to share the author's view       of the what has been done in the work. But the       scholarly critic does have an obligation to grasp and       accurately present the author's aims and orientation as they       are conveyed in the work.        When an author sees a review, the author should not feel       (1) the reviewer has said or implied I said something that I       never said or implied or (2) the reviewer has said or       implied that I failed to consider something that is       explicitly part of my presentation.        Good scholars do not mind critical reviews, even highly       critical ones, that are accurate and fair. Good       scholars despise reviews that are inaccurate or unfair, even       if they are positive.                    What a review covers depends on the review's purpose, the      audience, and the content and quality of the work being      reviewed. No possible recipe of ingredients will apply to      all or even most reviews. The closest we can come to this      is to list common elements of reviews, understanding that the      reviewer must judge what weight, if any, each merits in a      particular review. Some of these common elements to      consider in reviews include:              Does the work have a central thesis, argument or claim       that is clear, relatively unambiguous, fully presented,       logically consistent, and not inherently flawed?        Does the work adequately consider alternative arguments?        Does the work provide evidence that effectively supports       the advocated claim over alternative claims?                Is the evidence well chosen, properly gathered, and        effectively analyzed (or is the work methodologically        sound)?         How compelling is the evidence?                       Does the work neglect or misconstrue some relevant       research or theory in ways that raise questions and       significantly diminish confidence in its claims?        Are there serious logical flaws or gaps in the analysis?        Overall, is the argument compelling?        Overall, is the analysis a valuable contribution?        Or, does it have something to say that is worth       saying?                                       Common Readings      Recommended     Readings                  Wikipedia, \" Prisoner's       dilemma \"                      Related     Readings                  ...       ...                                 *. What is the theoretical natural state: is it inequality or    equality that should be explained?     Sometimes a seemingly tangential question has the potential to gain us    unexpected insights. At least since Rousseau wrote the on the    origins of inequality we have been able to conceive that either equality    or inequality may be considered the problem to explain. While    modern sociology attributes little explanatory value to ideas about the    natural state of humankind, we may still hope to enhance our    understanding by juxtaposing efforts to identify the social mechanisms    responsible for inequality with those aimed at specifying the mechanisms    that induce equality.

While rewriting, pay particular attention to the clear      identification of the systems of inequality. The examples      used may be a subset of a system, a particular context in a      system, or a location that is the intersection of two      systems. Try to clarify this as much as possible.       Try to think about what is unequal, and who are all the people      or all the positions that are related to those in the example      (and each other) by the inequality in the example.       Recall that some examples of inequality amongst people are      more appropriately understood as the effects of a system of      inequality. If people have different quality housing as a      result of income inequality, we usually want to conceive of this      as an effect of income inequality, rather than analyzing housing      inequality as a system of inequality. The \"system\" of      inequality is where the causal dynamics between the advantaged      and disadvantaged are centered. There is no hard and fast      rule about the proper way to define a system of inequality,      because the optimal way of understanding an inequality will      depend on our analytical goals                      Common Readings           Review readings of past weeks                      Recommended     Readings                  Review readings of past weeks       ...

This guide serves to provide both a guided, extended reading list     on analyzing social inequality (or stratification) and the syllabus     for a graduate course based on the core of this extended reading     list (over 200 articles are included below). The selection and     organization of materials stresses primary analytical issues facing     the study of inequality (rather than types of inequality or the     popularity of topics).            Most of the readings \u2013 mainly articles plus some book excerpts \u2013      are available online. The list includes direct links to the online      versions of all these references.

Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access    :      The     scope of the topics and materials . Each kind of    social inequality \u2013 such as class or gender \u2013 has distinctive dynamics and    each concrete instance of inequality has historically and culturally    specific characteristics. Yet, all social inequalities also share    critical common effects and requirements for persistence. For    example, all social inequalities produce legitimating ideologies, all    must curb resistance, all have to transfer the unequal resources and    positions to new generations, all produce divergent interests. To    understand a structural characteristic of some kind of inequality \u2013 such    as legitimation processes in a class system or violence in gender    inequality \u2013 we want to recognize that they represent a combination of the    dynamics common to most inequality systems and the specific    characteristics of that type of inequality. The topics below    pursue a series of fundamental questions about social inequalities,    seeking to investigate the general dynamics of inequalities, comparing    these dynamics across different types of inequality. Examples of    these topics include: what are the roles of interests in various kinds    of inequalities, how is inequality sustained across generations, what    processes induce conformity among both the advantaged and disadvantaged,    what mechanisms prevent rebellion, and what decides the intensity of    inequalities?     The readings represent the core of the stratification field in    sociology, the materials that sociologists working in this area expect    other others in the area to know, plus materials needed to pursue    important analytic issues under represented in the field.      The class     organization and goals . The class is intended for both    beginning and advanced graduate students. Critical    requirements for taking this course are a strong interest in inequality    and a commitment to the class project of investigating new ideas.     In this class, each week's activities will be organized around an    analytical task, as well as a set of readings. Rather than    focusing on discussion of the readings, the analytical tasks involve    attempting an analysis of inequality related to the week's issue,    building on the materials we read (in brief papers of 2-3 pages).     While mastering the existing research and theory is obviously a    prerequisite to doing good work, the approach in this class seeks to    develop analytical skills as well as understandings of the literature by    stressing actual analyses of inequality rather discussions of the    literature.     The course readings stress the foundational sociological literature on    inequality. Each week we will all look at some common    readings. The course guide will also point toward a range of other    recommended and related readings for further study for each topic -    students are not expected to read these optional materials as part of    the course. The recommended and related readings represent what a    student seeking to specialize in this area might read. Students in the    class are encouraged to scan these optional lists each week and look at    any pieces that seem particularly valuable or interesting.     All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our    class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'    efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will    adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our experiences    over the class. Every week, students will initiate discussions on    readings and papers. To see the discussant responsibilities for    each week, go to:      http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/analysis.of.inequality/Discussants.html         The readings below (the recommended and related readings as well as    the common readings that are the basis of the course) are almost all    available online \u2013 simply click the links to get to the articles.     For convenience, some readings are selections (excerpts from articles or    books) that appear in two printed collections that are now available    online: articles with \"[Grusky \u2013 Classic]\" appended to the listing are    from Inequality: Classic Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender ,    2006, eds. David B. Grusky and Szonja Szel\u00e8nyi; articles with \"[Grusky -    Contemporary]\" appended are from Inequality Reader: Contemporary     &amp; Foundational Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender , 2006,    eds. David B. Grusky and Szonja Szel\u00e8nyi \u2013 for most of the selections    from these readers, alternative citations and links are also provided    for the original publication or an appropriate alternative. Note:     Links for all readings will appear in the online version of the course     guide.      A note on the \"hidden\" material     below : Each section of this guide includes \u2013     beside the common readings \u2013 three subsections, one for an analytical     task , one for recommended readings , and one for related     readings . To simplify navigating through the course guide,    only the headings for these subsections are initially visible. The    content of all these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning    appearance of the page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the    viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then its contents will    appear. While this organization is helpful for negotiating the    page most of the time, it can become an obstacle if we want to search    the page (for example, for a particular article) as searches will ignore    the hidden material. To overcome this limitation, it is possible    to show all the hidden sections by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top     of the page (and simply reload the page to    collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their usual look). The table    of contents at the top of the page will still work to aid speedy    navigation to any section.                The Topics         I.

How can we conceive of and talk about social inequality in ways that are    general enough to apply across the range of relevant phenomena, consistent    enough to minimize conceptual ambiguities, and precise enough to be    analytically effective? Inequality is ubiquitous. People are    unequal in every conceivable way in endless circumstances, both immediate    and enduring, by both objective criteria and subjective experience.     So, what counts as social inequality ? Can we characterize it    in ways that let us confidently and impartially assess when there is more    or less of it?          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: What is social inequality ?       We often think that the meaning of social inequality is      self-evident or easy. Perhaps it is when we focus on extreme      versions of the more obvious forms of social inequality, such as      the rich compared to the poor. But, equally, perhaps it is      not when we consider inequalities that are subler or more      complex, such as those based on sexual preference or ethnic      identity or between nations. We want to begin by looking a      little deeper into our conceptualization of social inequalities.       Choose two kinds of inequality . For each kind of      inequality, consider an example showing a high degree of      inequality and another showing equality or a minimal amount of      inequality. Here we are simply trying to conceive a simple 2      x 2 table, showing two kinds of inequality and two levels of      inequality for each kind. This is the simplest design for      doing social analyses, whether that analysis is empirical or      theoretical. (Note: It is fine to use standard, commonly      discussed kinds of inequality, but being original and creative      about kinds of inequality to consider is also good.)       Describe (briefly) how the relevant groups are unequal for      each type. For each of these two kinds of inequality,      try to list the main ways that those affected are      unequal. For now, do not worry about why       such inequality exists. For now we are concerned with what      we mean by inequality, not what causes it. Try to specify      the crucial experiences, opportunities, or other circumstances      that distinguish the beneficiaries of the inequality from those      who are disadvantaged. Consider also the relationships      between the disadvantaged and advantaged, both direct and      indirect. (The idea of \" indirect relationships\"      refers to ways that the advantaged or disadvantaged influence the      circumstances or actions of those who are differently situated      without direct interaction, e.g. by controlling government      policies or creating a culture of fear.) In short, for each      of the two types of inequality, what induces us to call one      example high inequality and another low?       A final question . After working through the      questions above, try to complete a definition sentence beginning \"In      general, social inequality exists when ... .\" The goal      of this sentence is to provide a definition of social inequality      general enough to embrace the range of social inequalities but      also precise enough to distinguish social inequality from its      absence. The implicit strategy is compare what social      inequality means for the two chosen examples, then to try to      identify the common conditions that make them (and other forms)      all merit being called \"social inequality\" (distinguished from the      characteristics specific to certain types of inequality or      concrete historical and cultural conditions). To do this      involves not only the empirical comparison, but the appropriate      conceptual abstraction.       For the ambitious (to develop a       deeper grasp)...              Here are some other issues that you       might integrate into your initial assessment of inequalities               Vantage points . Might       some people (scholars, political actors, others) disagree       that any of the components you identify should really be       considered inequality ? If so, why?        (The goal here is to think through the reasons that people       disagree about what should be called inequality?)        Try to figure out how we might measure         the amount of inequality. Of the ways that you       have listed people being unequal, select which of these       differences seem most important. What might be       reasonable ways to measure each identified facet       of inequality? For each kind of inequality you have       selected an example where inequality is high and another       where it is low. Can you think of a measurement       procedure that will allow one to look at any society or       group and determine if some aspect of inequality is high,       medium, or low? Focus on realistic means that could be       applied in research, that could be used for the same aspects       of inequality when they apply to other kinds of       inequality. Do this only for the two or three facets       of inequality in your examples that seem most decisive.               For each of the two types of       inequality, if we put aside differences in the circumstances       of advantaged and disadvantaged people, what important       differences in social organization distinguish societies (or       other social groupings such as communities or organizations)       where that type of inequality is high from those where it is       low? The goal here is to consider if societies (or       other levels of social organization containing inequality)       that have high levels of some type of inequality       consistently differ from societies that have low levels, in       ways other than the difference in the level of this kind of       inequality.        Most people responding to the       prompts above will think about inequality between kinds of       people. Consider two other important concerns.        First, inequality may be between positions rather than       people (this is a critical concern which we will address       later). Second, inequality may concern \"units\" other       that people, such as families or organizations or nations.                                       Common Readings          David B.

What are common forms of social inequality?     What is the range of social inequalities that we should be addressing?    Pundits, scholars, and ordinary people usually focus on the couple    forms of inequality they experience as most troubling. Contemporary    sociology's sometimes blinkered perspective is reflected in the many    readers and texts on race, class, and gender. The range of analytically    relevant inequalities is considerably wider.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task : This week's task is to identify      major forms of inequality in two societies. The goal      is to see the range of inequalities that exist in      different societies. The remainder of this task description      just tries to show how to approach this systematically.       To start, choose two societies with which you have some      familiarity. It is fine to use this society or an another      society in which you have lived as one example (but it is an      interesting challenge to use two societies you have not      experienced). The two societies can be from two different      parts of the world or from different points in time. The      main goal is to use two societies that differ significantly in      their structure and culture, regardless whether those differences      reflect location, culture, historical circumstance, or something      else.       For each example (society), identify the significant,      widely-present forms of social inequality that persist      over time.              \"widely present\" means not limited to certain locations nor       small parts of the population; note that many instances of       inequality that are limited to particular places or subgroups       are, however, examples of some more generally defined kind of       inequality, so moving to a higher level of generality or       categorization identifies a widely present inequality of which       they are specific examples        two or more instances of inequality with a similar system or       structure but involving different populations should usually       be considered to of the same kind (e.g., similar ethnic       inequality processes or structures may apply to Hindi and       Chinese minorities)        The aim here is not to see how long the list of inequalities       might be, but we do want to see how diverse the forms of       inequality can be, and to consider if important kinds of       inequality are overlooked.                   Try to describe briefly each form of inequality       identified (for each society), by indicating:             to what degree is the inequality more a continuous gradation       (like years of age) or more a division into distinct       categories (like employed vs. unemployed)        what is unequal, that is what are the assets, opportunities,       capacities, relationships, or whatever that define the       inequality by their unequal distribution (this is not        what explains the inequality, but simply what is       unequal); this is self-evident for some kinds of inequality,       but not for others.        who is advantaged and who disadvantaged; in       essence, this asks how are the advantaged people different       from the disadvantaged people not only in the advantages that       define the inequality, but in other ways as well (e.g. for       ethnic inequalities, the groups are, in theory, defined by       ethnic identity [although ethnicity is tricky]; distinguishing       characteristics for some kinds of inequality might be more       difficult to characterize, and could, in theory, not exist if       placement is random)        [ optional \u2013 how do the disadvantaged and the       advantaged perceive the inequality?; do they have similar or       different conceptions of what is unequal, why they are       disadvantaged or advantaged, whether it is fair, and the       like?]                   In short , for two societies, you are preparing a list      of outstanding inequalities, that gives the primary      characteristics of each kind of inequality. You could make      this either as two lists or as two simple tables.       Finally , having prepared a catalog of the primary forms      of social inequality in the two societies, how would you compare      the two societies with respect to their patterns of social      inequality? All we are looking for here are initial,      outstanding differences and similarities (note that similarities      are at least as important as differences). To be clear, we      are just looking for an initial impression \u2013 a comprehensive      comparison would be a major project, obviously far beyond our      scope.             If this aspect of the analysis seems baffling, overwhelming,       or obscure initially, consider the following questions.        Does the overall amount of inequality seem greater in one       society than the other or similar or does this seem impossible       to guess? Do the structures of the societies or their       potential for change seem to be dominated by different or       similar inequalities? Does inequality overall seem more       rigid in one society than the other? Do major forms of       inequality seem to overlap a lot, or are they distinctive and       rather independent from each other? Is inequality more       continuous in one society and more categorical in the       other?                   For the ambitious with time to go       further:              How might we categorize the varied       forms of inequality discerned in the two societies into       groups defined by some notable similarities? For       example, if we have twelve types of inequality initially,       could we usefully fit them into two or three categories that       reflect their similarities (and differences)? Here are       some examples of criteria that might be used to categorize       inequalities:                Consider the processes        producing them         Consider who is advantaged and        disadvantaged         Consider how one form affects        the others         Consider their legitimacy claims                 Consider their histories                 Consider any other reasonable        logic you can conceive for grouping them, remembering        that a useful analytic taxonomy will usually rely on        some aspect of causation                      Do any of the forms of social       inequality seem more important to the structure and       organizational dynamics of a society than do others?        If so, why?

IV. What distinguishes legitimate from illegitimate    forms of inequality?     We often use the term inequality to refer only to forms of    inequality we consider unjust or otherwise undesirable. Yet, much    inequality is commonly accepted as appropriate, fair, or desirable in    societies. The amount of legitimacy attributed to a form of    inequality can be anywhere between extremely high (e.g. the authority of    parents over infants) to extremely low (e.g., slavery in a modern society    with well-developed civil rights). The assessment of    legitimacy should always consider potential differences among    differentially situated groups (e.g., those enjoying advantages in a    system of inequality, those disadvantaged, and those relatively    unaffected), and the degree of agreement or disagreement about legitimacy    assessments. Analytically, we want to ask what processes or    conditions cause a form of inequality to be considered more or less    legitimate. When does the legitimacy status of inequality change or    become contested?          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task : Using examples of two kinds of      inequality, consider what circumstances appear to foster or to      erode the acceptance of the inequality as legitimate.       First , select two kinds of inequality .       These can be from any place or time, but it might be simpler if      they coexist in the same society. They do not need to be      inequalities considered socially \"important.\" For each       kind of inequality, select one example or circumstance with      high \"legitimacy\" when those involved appear accepting or      complacent and another example or circumstance with      low \"legitimacy\" when those involved contest the      inequality. Thus you are considering four examples in all,      two that are uncontested, high legitimacy and two that are      contested, low legitimacy, based on the two types of      inequality. This is, once again, the simplest comparative      design for social analysis, essentially a two by two table, with      one direction being the two kinds of inequality and the other      being the two levels of legitimacy. (Whether an inequality      is perceived as legitimate and whether it is contested are not the      same, but we are simplifying for our current goals.)       Second , for each of the two kinds of inequality,      describe what are the principal arguments or claims offered       by the advantaged (or their representatives) to defend or      explain the system of inequality in the examples you have      chosen.              Look for arguments that respond to three common claims in       defense of inequality, that it is (1) just, (2)       necessary, and (3) beneficial to all.        Where possible, identify the general cultural beliefs or       symbols from which the arguments seek to gain acceptance or       weight, such as religious beliefs, science, or fear of       outsiders.                    Is it possible to distinguish between claims that seem to be       historically or culturally contingent and those more       fundamental to the particular kind of inequality?        [Explanatory note: If we compare organized religions we find       that all have practices and rituals for marriage. Many       of the specific rituals are artifacts of the historical       conditions in which they emerged, and would just as       effectively if they were different. Some aspects of       these practices, such as significant property exchanges (e.g.,       bride price) may reflect functional needs of the prevailing       economic and kinship system, although their concrete       manifestation can vary. Some even more general aspects,       such as requirement of marriage to identify kinship       relationships of children may reflect fundamental requirements       for the functional order of any kinship system. Claims       about inequality can similarly be categorized from the       historically arbitrary to those that seem unavoidable.]                   Third , when describing the legitimacy claims, consider      if the claims when the inequality is contested differ from      when its acceptance is largely unproblematic. That is, for each of      the two kinds of inequality, what seems to distinguish the      examples where legitimacy claims succeed from those where they      fail?             When the disadvantaged seem to accept legitimacy claims,       which arguments appear to be convincing or acceptable to       them? Why do they accept these?        When the disadvantaged question and contest the legitimacy       of the inequality, what are the principal counter arguments       they use? Their counter arguments suggest how the       legitimacy claims are failing.                   In short , you are developing a description of the ways      that people try to legitimate two kinds of inequalities, comparing      examples where the legitimacy efforts succeed with examples where      they do not. The goal is not to explain the range of these      claims or when they succeed, but to get a first level sense of      what legitimacy claims are and why they are important.       Finally , in response to the preceding analysis you have      developed of legitimacy claims regarding four examples of      inequality (based on two types of inequality), try to state      three general hypotheses about legitimacy claims, the role      of legitimacy, or conflicts over legitimacy in systems of      inequality. Elaborate each of these hypotheses just enough      that we can understand what they mean and what motivates      them.              These are hypotheses , which means they are not       theories and not claims we can defend. Rather, we can       think of them as informed speculations about what might be       true. They are ideas worth researching or worth thinking       about if trying to develop a theory about the legitimation of       inequality. Essentially, this is asking what ideas       spring to mind as a result of doing the empirical comparisons       in this task.

Down So Long (unpublished      ms.). Disputed      Ideals: Ideologies of Domesticity and Feminist Rebellion                             V. What is the critical distinction between positional    inequality and status inequality?     To put it simply, positional inequality refers to inequalities    between \"positions\" such as the different levels in an organizational    hierarchy (e.g., president, divisional manager, supervisor, clerk).     These locations give their advantages and disadvantages to the people who    circulate through them. Status inequality refers to social    advantages and disadvantages that adhere to categories of people without    regard to the positions they hold (such as race). Grasping the    differences between these two \"types\" of inequality and the relationships    between them is crucial for analytic clarity. (This distinction has    some similarity to the common contrast between achieved status and    ascribed status, but it is analytically different. Our distinction    stresses the way inequality is socially organized while the    achieved/ascribed concepts refer to the ways people acquire a    characteristic.)          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: How do positional and status      inequalities differ and how are those differences important?       Select two examples of positional inequalities and two      examples of status inequalities . The examples may be two      fundamentally different kinds of positional (or status) inequality      or they may be two distinctive instances of the same kind of      inequality appearing in different societies (e.g., racial      inequality in a plantation economy and racial inequality in a      market economy). It will probably be easier to use four      reasonably concrete examples (such as contemporary racial      inequality in Britain). Using more general categories (such      as racial inequality in market economies) is a more ambitious      strategy.             As usual, for each type of inequality, clearly describe who       are the advantaged and the disadvantaged and how they are       unequal.                   Enumerate the characteristics that distinguish the two      examples of positional inequality from the two examples of      status inequality . To put it differently, in what ways are      both examples of positional inequality different from both      examples of status inequality? Examples of things to      consider include (but should not be limited to):             homogeneity of people sharing similar standing (i.e., level       of [dis]advantage)        intergenerational rigidity (likelihood of having same       standing as parents)        ways that people's standing may improve or decline over time              diffuseness of impact on people's lives (i.e., what       proportion of people's time, activities, and relationships are       highly influenced)        legal status and government role in regulating, preserving,       or challenging the inequality        legitimation processes (content of the justifying ideology,       who or what promotes the legitimacy)        historical roots of the inequality structure                   For each difference you identify above between the positional      and status inequalities, please             briefly describe how the positional and status inequalities       seem to differ with respect to this characteristic, and,        if you can, suggest what might explain the difference (or,       to put it differently, suggest why you would expect this       difference to distinguish other examples of status and       positional inequalities).                   In short : We are making an initial effort to      identify general ways that systems of positional inequality differ      from systems of status inequality. The goal is to produce a      list of plausible differences, and to get a first sense of what      form these differences will take and why they appear.             note that we are again using a very basic \"research design,\"       comparing two examples of positional inequality with two       examples of status inequality; this is the simplest possible       design for trying to identify differences between two       categories (as we must have at least two examples of each       category to make the simplest control for other sources of       variation among the phenomena being categorized, in this case       instances of social inequality)                   Finally : Based on the differences you enumerate and      explore from your examples, what hypotheses do you have about      general differences between positional and status inequalities?

VI. How do we understand \"honor\" status hierarchies,    that lack apparent material bases?     Academia is one good example of a well-developed system (or systems) of    honorific inequality. High school peer groups are often good    examples of short-lived patterns of reputational inequality. The    idea of celebrity is usually associated with unequal prestige. The    key to honorific inequalities is that people compete for recognition and    deference, rather than material goods, power, or opportunities.     Purely honorific inequality structures are rare, as the pursuit of    prestige is commonly intermingled with materialistic inequities. The study    of honor and prestige systems (other than in the specialized form of    occupational prestige) is underdeveloped in sociology. Theoretical    works recognize its significance, but most treat honorific inequality as    both causally derivative and of marginal importance when compared to    economic and political inequalities. While prestige and honor are    elusively intangible, we are likely to misunderstand any type of    inequality if they are ignored.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: What do non-material      inequalities of honor or prestige look like in practice and what      is the logic of their processes?       Select two (or more) examples of honorific inequality      systems , where people \"compete\" directly for recognition,      respect, and deference. Such systems often include income and      power rewards. But we are looking for forms of inequality      where honorific status is central. Here are several      reasonable identifying characteristics to consider:             Does honor (or prestige or the like) motivate competition       for desirable locations as much as does power or material       rewards?        Is deference to others determined as much by their perceived       prestige as by their structural position, wealth, authority,       or the like?        In general, are honor or prestige acts at least as much a       cause of material rewards as it is a result of them?                   For each inequality system selected , try to      develop an analytical assessment of the way it works by responding      to these:             Identify and describe as well as you can what       conveys or is experienced as honor ; consider how it       looks both from within and from outside; think about ways that       the lives of those with more honor differ from the lives of       those with less; also, think about how we know which people       have more honor, or to put it differently, how we know to whom       we should defer and who should defer to us. (Think about       titles, awards, forms of dress, access to activities, and so       forth.)        Describe what people do to gain honor or to compete       for honor.        What decides the distribution of honor overall       within each system? Consider what processes and which       people decide who has more honor. Is it controlled from       the top or the bottom? Are people aware who decides the       outcomes?        What induces people to accept and conform        to the expectations of the prestige system? Why do they       defer to those who possess more honor? (Consider both       the carrots and the sticks.)                   Compare these systems of honor and prestige to       the systems of positional and status inequality we have      considered. Try to identify two or more important      differences and two or more important similarities,      explaining as best you can why you think each of these differences      and similarities exist.       In short , the aim of this week's task is to compare two      specific examples of honor inequality systems (and secondarily      compare them to inequalities where honor is secondary) to get an      initial sense of how honor inequality systems work.

How do people experience inequality and why do    these experiences matter?     Research on inequalities commonly treats experience as a simple effect    of inequality; interesting but secondary to theory and explanation.     Here we want to think of experience not only as a result, but also as a    potential ingredient to the explanation of inequalities. The    experiences of inequalities can serve as strong motivating forces at all    levels. The experiences also encompass not only the outcomes of    inequality, but all the processes that sustain or challenge it.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: How do lower-status and      higher-status people experience inequalities and their locations      within them? With what consequences for the systems of      inequality?       Select two systems of inequality : one in which      you have (now or in the past) been in a relatively low-status      location and another system in which you have been in a relatively      high-status location. The point here is to select systems in      which you have observational knowledge about the experience of      inequality. If possible, use a form of positional inequality      for one example and status inequality for the other, but it okay      if that is too much of a stretch given your biography.              As usual, briefly describe each system of inequality.        Who are included, what is unequally distributed, who are       advantaged or disadvantaged, and the like. If you are       going to consider a subset of a larger system of inequality,       be clear about what you are doing and why.        (OPTIONAL \u2013 To go further ... To       seek a more complete means of assessing experience, double       the examples, to consider two systems in which you have       experienced low standing and two in which you have had       higher standing, again representing both status inequality       and positional inequality if possible. This will give       you much more traction for seeing generalization       possibilities, but the time requirements may be more than       you can manage.)                   For each of these systems of inequality, try to characterize ,      briefly, how those in      high-status locations have different experiences than those in      low-status locations . This is not easy to do      well. Among other things, note that it is rarely obvious      which kinds of experiences matter more and it is difficult to      reduce the varieties of experience into a few categories that are      not arbitrary.       Focus on typ ical or defining       experiences. While experience seems inherently      individualistic because it is to such a degree private and      internal, the goal here is to move beyond the individual.       Systems of social inequality are comprised of socially organized      \"structures,\" processes, and cultural understandings. In the      search of a social analysis of inequality, we are looking for      common or shared experiences (understanding that these may be      shared unequally, so that there are alternative experiences common      to subgroups determined by other conditions, circumstance, or even      random variation). A good way to start is by thinking about      typical experience.       To make this effort more systematic and comparable, while trying      to assess differences in experience, here are dimensions you      might consider :             How much and in what ways do people recognize the inequality       and think about it? For example, people may                grasp the outlines of social inequality between groups        or positions         see themselves as being in unequal relationships, but        not have a conception of this as part of a larger pattern        of inequality (e.g., when women or men see themselves as        superior or inferior to the other sex, but do not perceive        there to be gender inequality)         people may not be able to conceptualize their experience        of an inequality as being inequality, but think of it in        different terms (e.g., believing it is not that \"they\" are        inferior or that \"we\" discriminate against \"them,\" \"they\"        are just different)                      in what way do people seem to perceive or talk about       fairness with respect to an inequality?               what sense of fairness do they have in their own        position?         and how do they think about the fairness of the        existence of inequality (of this sort)?                      how do the advantaged and disadvantaged have distinctive       experiences about what other people who share their standing       are like?               do the reference groups have different demographic        compositions (e.g. sex, ethnicity, age, class) apart from        the defining distinctions due to that inequality?         are their cultural differences in the ways people dress,        ways of talking, leisure activities, religiosity, or the        like?                      how do people perceive those at their level as different       from those at the other end of the inequality spectrum, and       how do they interact differently with them?               In particular, what, if any, are the common patterns of        deference when interacting with a previously unknown        person at the other end of the inequality spectrum?        (Most importantly, presumably, within the        institutional context embracing this form of inequality,        but also, potentially, in external contexts.)                      How do advantaged and disadvantaged people differ in general       ways that they experience the possibilities and realities of       life?               how do people experience ambition vs.        resignation?;         how do they differ in expectations for the future?         do they allocate blame for failures and credit for        successes (of the individual) differently?         do they have different orientations toward behavioral        tendencies such as violence, intimidation, manipulation,        cooperation, and subservience?         are there significant differences in religiosity?         do they seem to feel different loyalties toward the        institution surrounding the structure of inequality,        toward those in a similar location in the inequality        structure, toward those at a different level?         how do they differ in their trust in authority and        government?                      If you can, consider the implications of social mobility or       changing social standing for these experiences of       inequalities. That is, do people differ in their       experience of a location in a system of inequality depending       on how they got there?                Note that even people distinguished by locations in a        system of status inequalities may experience some form of        mobility. First, they may experience a shift in the        relative weight of the status inequality due to changes in        other status investing characteristics; an example        could be different meaning of race for affluent        blacks vs. poor blacks and affluent whites vs. poor        whites, where the analytical class difference may be        experience in terms of race. Second, the standing of        an entire status group or category may change over time;        consider, for example, the changes that have been seen by        middle-age blacks and whites in South Africa or women and        men in many countries.         Note that someone whose status appears unchanged may        experience it differently because the statuses of        significant others do change                      How do people differ in their experiences of being       advantaged or disadvantaged in the referent form of inequality       depending on their location in other important forms of       inequality? (For example, how does the experience of       being Native American differ between the highly educated and       the low educated?)                   In short , the goal of this task is to contrast the      experiences of being advantaged with those of being disadvantaged      under two different kinds of inequality. The goal is to      examine these differences systematically, and to consider their      causes and their consequences.       Finally , after completing work on the issues above,      considering the patterns of similarities and dissimilarities you      have discussed, can you devise any general hypotheses about the      experience of inequalities? That is, from the specific      patterns of differences you observe in your cases, what general      differences might you expect to find in other inequalities, in the      experiences of inequality, and in the causes and effects of those      experiences?

How should we conceive interests in the    analysis of inequality?     Almost everyone analyzing any system of inequality refers    to \"interests\" sooner or later, even authors who emphasize cultural    or normative explanations. Yet, interests usually receive casual,    unsystematic treatment. This casual reliance on interests builds on    two simple assumptions: (1) a range of relevant potential actions and    events will have differential consequences for people depending on their    location in a system of inequality and (2) anticipation or past    experiences of these consequences will influence peoples' actions.     From this starting point the considerations of interests take many routes,    considering objective and subjective interests, individual versus    collective interests, realistic compared to misconceived interests,    consistent versus inconsistent interests, contradictory and ambiguous    interests, and so on. Simply put, every theory of inequality relies    on a theory of interests (even if a negative theory).          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Interests       Select two examples of inequality; if possible, use one example      of positional inequality and one of status inequality.             Characterize who are the advantaged and who are the       disadvantaged in each example        As always, specify clearly what is unequal        If an example is not itself a system of inequality, but a       subsystem, a site where the effects of a system of inequality       are played out, or an intersection between systems of       inequality, then be clear what the relevant system or systems       of inequality might be                   For each example, examine the interests that seem to be      determined by the social organization of inequality, regardless      how people recognize them.             List the most important ways that the \"objective\" interests       of the advantaged are at odds with those of the       disadvantaged; here the objective interests means the       interests implied by the structure of inequality and their       location within this structure, regardless of their       recognition of the interests        Similarly, list the most important ways that the \"objective\"       interests of advantaged people or groups converge with       those of the disadvantaged. Here we are concerned with       interests related to conditions or practices that have a       widespread influence, usually where both the advantaged and       disadvantaged are exposed to common effects. For example,       potentially a shared interest between officials of an       autocratic government and the citizenry in maintaining public       peace would be relevant, but parallel or similar interests in       being healthy would not. Similarly, the employers and       workers in a corporation may have divided interests about the       distribution of the company's income, but they have convergent       interests in the corporation being successful.        For the above assessments, both the interests at odds and       those that converge, consider whether the objective interests       seem try to characterize the most important interests in terms       of their clarity, consistency, extremity, and the like.        thinking about objective interests not as an individual       experiences them, but as they are produced and sustained by       the systems of inequality, how would you ?                   Now, a really tough part. As best you can, with these      examples, consider how interests become recognized or conceived       by people who are subject to the interest-producing circumstances      of inequality.               We want to avoid the temptation to think about this in terms       of the reasons an individual might choose one way or       another. Instead, we want to examine how the       characteristics of objective interests or the structure of the       relevant inequality induces people to interpret their       interests in one way or another. We are seeking the       social conditions or dynamics that direct the conception of       interests.        Note to begin that people may conceive their interests as       some subset of the objective interests previously identified,       or they may rely on conceptions that ignore or even oppose the       objective interests.        What institutional and cultural processes or arrangements       seem to influence the emergence of common interests based on       the inequalities in your examples? E.g., the aged       or young adults may have a strong, self-conscious sense of       common interests under some circumstances but at other times       not recognize possible shared interests.; what determines when       they do see their concerns as common interests? Given       the objective interests you have identified, think under what       conditions you would expect people more likely to identify and       pursue each of those objective interests as opposed to the       conditions under which they would not do so. Similarly,       consider under what conditions people might be prone to       misinterpret their interests entirely. Or, under what       conditions they are more likely to stress oppositional       interests and under what conditions they will emphasize the       interests they have in common with those with whom they are       unequal?        For each example, in what important ways and under what       circumstances do people's conceived interests seem to diverge       from their objective interests? (A classic example       occurs when members of a group, such as the working class,       believe their interests are best served by a political party       that is actually committed to policies that threaten their       interests, such as those typically associated with       Republicans.) What seems to account for the       disjunctions? (Consider both the advantaged and the       disadvantaged.)                   For the inequalities you are using, when and where do individual      interests seem to contradict collective interests? What      consequences does this have? (E.g., it is generally      in students' collective interest that professors grade all      students the same way, but tall, pretty boys have individual      interests in biased grading if professors favor tall, pretty      boys.)       In short , the goal here is to develop some initial      ideas about the ways that interests work. We use two      examples as the simplest design that allows us to begin      generalizing about inequality, rather than describing the      character of a single instance. Using the chosen examples,      we want to produce some initial ideas about the range of objective      interests, both oppositional and shared, created by an inequality      system. Then we want to ask how people's conceptions of      their interests arise out of those objective interests in      interaction with impinging social conditions. And, in      particular we want to consider how and why conceived interests      might diverge from or even become inconsistent with objective      interests.

IX. What determines the allocation of people (or    other relevant unit) within a positional system of inequality?     This issue includes questions commonly addressed in the literatures    on social mobility and status attainment (and on placement within    organizations). More or less independent of its occupants, a system    of positional inequality has a static     \"structure\" characterized by the direct relationships of    authority and dependence between positions ; the ranking of    positions according to the rewards, authority, opportunities, and statuses    attached to them; and the demographic profile defined by the number of    positions of each type. A positional inequality system also has a dynamic     structure defined by the movement of people through it, both    within careers and between generations. These two components of    structure \u2013 the static and the dynamic \u2013 are linked by the selection    processes controlling access to positions. We can usefully conceive    positional inequality as the juxtaposition of two parallel systems that    are often confused or conflated: first, the structure of relationships    among the positions constituting the system of inequality (e.g., the    enduring authority relationship between a managerial position and a    line-worker position), and, second, the relations between the people who    occupy these positions (e.g., the interactions between managers and    workers). The patterns of people's movement between positions both    reflects and influences the relationships among positions, but it also    shows the impact of impinging status inequalities. To understand the    inequalities among people, we obviously need to understand what decides    which people occupy which positions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: We will explore how positional      inequalities work. Recall that two general examples of positional      inequalities would be the occupational structure of a modern      society or the hierarchy of positions within a complex      organization. Note that, in this analytical context, income      inequality is an effect of positional inequalities;      income inequality is not itself a system of inequality      (involving neither transferable positions nor status groups),      although it functions as both an incentive and consequence of      positional (and status) inequalities. Also note that positional      inequalities are commonly constituted by relatively clear \"local\"      hierarchies that only loosely translate into a societal wide      hierarchy. For example, complex organizations usually have      well-defined positional hierarchies, but their finer distinctions      are organization or industry specific. As a result, people      (both scholars and ordinary people) use common characteristics of      positions \u2013 such as income, authority level, or organizational      size \u2013 to translate \"local\" positional standings into a comparable      metric.       Choose two dissimilar examples of positional inequalities.       Try to choose two that have different institutional settings, are      not closely causally connected to each other, or operate by      different logics. They may coexist in one society or be      drawn from different (in space or time) societies.       For each example, describe the overall structure of      positions. Among other things, an analytical description of      a positional structure should consider the following:             Assess the differential characteristics attached to the       positions (rewards, authority, visibility, etc.)        Summarize and characterize the relationships among       positions.                    Consider the simple demographics of the system: how many       positions exist at each level?; what is the turnover rate of       personnel occupying the positions (the departure rates)?; how       stable is the demographic profile (i.e., do the relative and       absolute numbers remain the same over time)?        If possible to assess, how did the existing configuration of       positions come into existence?                   For each example, try to describe the \"normal\" pathways of      movement into and between positions             What are the typical initial entry points, the positions       that take people who have not previously been in the system of       positional inequality? For example, in a large business       or organization, many positions are typically filled by       promotions from other positions; people are not usually hired       from the outside for such positions. Commonly, a If these entry-point       positions are themselves unequal, also consider                How are the entry points unequal ?         What determines who gets in which ones?         Who controls the allocation process of the initial        positions (directly and indirectly)?                      What is the pattern of movement among positions within the       system?               To what degree does selectivity operate (the demographic        constraint)? (Among other things, this asks what        proportion of people at any given level will ascend to a        higher level.)         Consider if lateral movement among positions is relevant        to hierarchical movement.         Is there significant downward movement as well as upward        in the positional hierarchy? If so, remember        to examine downward as well as upward for all issues about        movement among positions.         What appears to decide who moves up into more desirable        positions (or down)?                  Is the determining process fairly consistent across         positions or does it vary by how high or in what         sector the position appears?          who has decision-making power?          how standardized or impartial are the processes         governing mobility among positions? Note that         impartiality can be the result of self-conscious         efforts to eliminate bias and reliance on         inappropriate criteria, but, alternatively, it also         can be the result of an uncontrolled process that is         inherently unbiased (as some would suggest for market         mechanisms)? Slave traders, for example, may be         just as impartial toward the ethnic divisions among         their chattel as the most progressive advocate of         meritocratic assessments.                                      How is the position-allocation process ideologically       conceived?;                particularly consider ideological constructs that        reinforce, obfuscate, legitimate, or challenge the        allocation process.         how are \"success\" and \"failure\" conceived (as moral and        practical categories)         are there competing ideological formulations of what        causes success and failure?                                 Taking into account all the above, comparing the two examples,      what can you say about the patterns of affiliation, alliance,      deference, patronage, avoidance, opposition, and conflict that      constitute the structure of relationships among people occupying      different locations in a positional inequality? While      exploring this issue, pay careful attention to the distinction      between the positions and the people occupying them.       In short , the goal of this task is to gain some insight      into the ways that positional systems of inequality work.       Using two concrete examples is the simplest possible design for      identifying some of the common characteristics of such      systems. A commonly unanticipated difficulty in analyzing      such systems arises from their duality: a structure of      relationships among the positions independent of the people who      occupy them and the dynamics of relationships among the people who      do occupy the positions.

X. What are the bases of actions that secure dominance    over time?     From those enjoying the most privileged positions to those suffering the    most disadvantages, people may believe that the system of inequality that    divides them reflects the elusively differential favor of the gods, the    cruel fate of nature's uneven treatment, or unavoidable results of    people's differential efforts and capacities. In truth, systems of    inequality require work to keep them going, particularly the efforts of    those in superior positions to preserve the shape of the system and their    positions within it. We cannot hope to grasp the logic of a system    of inequality until we understand what this work is and how it gets done.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Assess how and why advantaged      people (or their agents) act in ways that (1) preserve their      advantages and (2) preserve the system of inequality that gives      them advantages.       Select two examples of inequality to assess the actions of      advantaged people. The first example should concern gender      inequality \u2013 this may be an instance of gender inequality (e.g.,      gender inequality in an organization, or in an occupation, or in a      sport) or it may be gender inequality more generally (although      this may prove more difficult). The second example should be      a different kind of inequality, preferably an example of      positional inequality or alternatively an example of a quite      different form of status inequality.       For each example of inequality, the goal is to identify and      explain the kinds of actions by advantaged people that (1) seem to      occur consistently and (2) seem to reinforce their      advantages. To approach this problem systematically, try to      answer the following about each example of inequality:             How do the advantaged people treat disadvantaged people in       direct interactions; the relevant comparisons are with the       ways the advantaged relate to each other and the ways the       disadvantaged relate to each other?        How do advantaged people have different kinds of       relationships with other advantaged people than than they have       with disadvantaged people (this is similar to the previous,       but concerns the more general problem of relationships        rather than interactions )?        In what ways might common actions or behavioral patterns of       those in the advantaged \"class\" \u2013 actions that use or reflect       their advantaged circumstances \u2013 reinforce the privileges of       advantaged people, even though the actions are not aimed at       disadvantaged people or at sustaining inequality? (For       example, the advantaged might buy all unused land for golf       courses and expansive estates, leaving poor farmers no way to       expand their acreage for crops.)        How do advantaged people respond if one of them is       challenged by a disadvantaged person.                \"Challenges\" can take many forms. A member of a        subordinate group may simply refuse to show \"proper\"        deference, as when a lower caste person does not step        aside, a black woman does not go to her place in the rear        of a bus, or a member of the secretarial pool addresses        managers by their first name just as they do her.         Someone with lower standing may adopt the dress or        mannerisms of those with higher standing, or attempt to        move into their neighborhoods or schools. More        directly, someone with lower standing may reject and defy        efforts to exercise authority by those \"above\" them.         And so forth ....         Consider not only the actions of the person who is        directly challenged, but potential actions by others in        the advantaged class.                      How do advantaged people exercise power in government, over       laws, or in the economy in ways that benefit those with       advantages?        How do advantaged people respond if there is a collective       challenge to the system of inequality in which they have       advantages?                   Looking over the range of actions you identify as relevant      above, can they usefully be categorized? For example, one      might divide them into those that mainly benefit an individual's      status and those that mainly help sustain the system of      inequality. The goal here is to consider if there is an      analytically useful way to reduce the range of relevant actions      and behavior patterns into a small number of general types.       What within the system of inequality seems to organize and      ensure the actions that sustain it? For example, in the      simplest conceivable system of inequality, we might find the only      mechanism is the interests of those in dominance \u2013 they      individually act on those interests in a manner unmediated      by ideology, norms, relationships with others in the dominant      group, laws, organizational processes, or anything else.       More complex systems involve mechanisms that induce these actions,      giving individuals motivation, direction, and support.       Looking at the range of actions identified as relevant, what stand      out as the mechanisms that make such actions consistent and      effective?       What seem to be important limitations on the actions that secure      dominance? How are these actions constrained by laws, norms,      ideology, resources, or the like? What conditions or      potentials for the future might cause the actions to lose      enthusiasm or effectiveness?       In short , this task concerns the ways that inequality      systems induce advantaged groups to act in ways that sustain the      inequality (and their standing within that inequality). Once      again, using two examples is the simplest design to allow initial      speculations about the general functioning of inequality.       The questions above aim to help one to think systematically about      the range of possible actions and their sources.       When analyzing the actions of the advantaged (and      disadvantaged) as described above, keeping several considerations      in mind may help:             The shorthand references here to \"the actions of advantaged       people\" do not imply that all advantaged people act the same       way or that the actions that sustain inequality are produced       in the same way and at the same rate by all the       advantaged. Such actions may be nearly universal, they       may be typical but with a high degree of variation       across people and circumstances, or they may be the special       actions of a minority who are the key representatives of the       group interests.        The analytical focus should be on the processes and       circumstances that induce enough actions of sufficient       effectiveness by enough advantaged people to protect the       inequality system. An individualistic focus on the       motives or beliefs of people will probably go astray.        Note initially that the relevant actions of the advantaged       may differ from those of the disadvantaged in varied ways       other than reflecting divergent interests. For example,       (1) the opportunities to act may differ (e.g. differential       access to higher education), (2) analogous actions may       have different effects, and (3) even with equivalent       opportunities and effects, they may choose to act differently       (e.g. because they have different beliefs or respond to       different interests).

Inequality systems do not only have causes that bring them into    existence and causes that preserve them, they also have causes that    potentially reduce or eliminate them. Systems of inequality    may decline because they are pushed out of the way by new systems of    inequality, because they simply become increasingly ineffective or    irrelevant, because the disadvantaged are increasingly able to overcome    their circumstances as individuals, or because the system is dramatically    overturned by collective actions from below or intrusion from    invaders. How and why these processes dilute, undermine, or    eliminate inequalities is theoretically underdeveloped.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Declining inequalities       Select as example of social inequality, positional or status,      that showed significant reductions in the degree of inequality      over time.              For the selected example of inequality, if it is not a       system of inequality but a component, result, or instance of a       system of inequality, the analysis should include careful       consideration of the system itself.        (Note that inequality may decline in a component as a result       of overall decline in the system, decline in a component may       induce greater inequality in the system, or decline in a       component may take place independently of and without       noticeable impact of the enveloping system.                   In what ways did those involved in the example of inequality      being considered actively promote or resist its      decline?              In our simplest examples, \"those involved\" reduces to the       advantaged group versus the disadvantaged. In real life,       seems can be much more complex. Each system of       inequality may have multiple types of involvement,       distinguished by subtle or ambiguous differences of interests,       relationships and activities. And, systems of inequality       overlap and interact. We want to be sensitive to this       potential complexity, but willing to reduce it conceptually as       far as possible to produce a manageable model.        Note that people may actively promote or resist a change in       inequality for motives that are not focused on the issue of       the inequality's persistence.        The goal here is to characterize the types of people whose       actions tended to reinforce the inequality and those whose       actions tended to erode it. Recall that members of       advantaged groups may join the challengers (against their       putative interests) and members of the disadvantaged may join       the supporters.                   Were any other coexisting systems of inequality declining or      becoming more extreme during the same period? If so, is it      possible to identify causal processes that might connect the      simultaneous changes?       Were there direct clashes over the competing interests of those      advantaged and those disadvantaged by system of inequality that      was declining? If so, what were there causes and their      consequences?       Were there any independent changes in the circumstances of the      advantaged people that plausibly diminished their will or ability      to sustain the pattern of inequality?       Were actors who were not direct participants in the systems of      inequality (i.e. not acting as members of the advantaged or      disadvantaged) significant for promoting or obstructing the      movement toward change? The state is an obvious contender      here, but so are others whose interests or symbolic commitments      seem to be at stake.       Are there other processes, actors, circumstances, or causal      dynamics neglected by the above questions that seem important to      analyzing the changes in inequality in the examples being      considered?       In short , the goal this week is to explore the      conditions and processes that work against the persistence of      inequalities under appropriate structural and historical      circumstances.

What are the theoretical and empirical    relationships between different forms of inequality?     Multiple systems of inequality coexist in societies, with crosscutting    categories and with individuals simultaneously located in each. An    older tradition in sociology suggested that the degree of overlap between    different forms of inequality was one condition influencing the likelihood    of class formation. A more recent interest has been the    \"intersection\" between race, gender, and class as experienced by    individuals, with the central (largely atheoretical) premise that the    implications of one's status in one system depends on one's statuses in    the others. Our concern here is more at the level of inequality's    organization, asking in what ways different systems of inequality interact    with each other.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Interdependence of inequalities            Select one society and historical moment (or one period, such as      the second half of the 20 th century). Within this      historical context, select two examples of systems of positional      inequality and two examples of systems of status inequality,      chosen such that a significant number of individuals will have a      location within each of the four systems considered. .       Assess in what ways and to what degree an individual's status in      one instance of inequality relates to others. To be systematic,      consider             How standing in one form of positional inequality relates to       standing in the other example of positional inequality        How standing in one instance of status inequality relates to       standing in the other form of status inequality        How standing in the systems of positional inequality relate       to standing in the systems of status inequality                   Assess how the organization and functioning of these systems of      inequality influence or overlap each other. Among other things,      this might include considering             How the \"locations\" in the two examples of positional       inequality are related. Are any locations defined       simultaneously in both systems? Are there enduring       relationships between locations in the two systems that       continue regardless who are in those locations? Are there       sustained patterns of movement between the two systems?        What relationships exist among the the symbolic       representations and ideological legitimation schemes       associated with the forms of inequality being examined?        Are they simply independent?; are they separate but drawing on       some common ideas?; are they partially or wholly merged into       one scheme that serves all at once?        In what ways is persistence of one system of inequality       dependent on its relationship with another? For example, how       might the elimination of any one system of inequality affect       the others.?        What links exist between the laws and governmental       mechanisms that support these systems of inequality?        Can we identify inconsistencies or sources of friction       between these systems of inequality?        How do historical developments and changes in these systems       relate to each other?                                Common Readings          Jerry A.

What causes inequality?     Perhaps the most fundamental question about inequalities, and sometimes    seeming the most illusive to answer, is the misleadingly simple question,    what causes inequality? While no general, all embracing answer is    possible (at this time), progress in understanding inequality demands that    we continually try to improve our analyses of the causes. Any effort    to do this must consider different forms of causation that are    possible.              Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: We want to investigate what      causes inequalities. Causation is a difficult, often      elusive, concept. What we mean by the causes of inequalities      can take different forms. We can ask why it comes into      existence. This question about origins may concern the      specific historical circumstances or sequence of events in which      an inequality emerges. Or we might interpret original causes      in terms of the social conditions necessary for such inequality to      emerge or, somewhat differently, the social conditions that make      it unavoidable. We might instead ask what causes (or allows)      an inequality to persist over time, potentially distinct from the      reasons for its origin, the conditions and processes that sustain      it. Or, we might focus on the variations in the severity of      some inequality, seeking the key to understanding it in the      conditions that cause it to be great in some places and slight in      others. In either case, we may stress the mechanisms, the      recurring actions and social processes that produce the      inequality, or we may stress the conditions that allow or require      it. Given this expanse of possibilities, we must narrow our      question, to make it reasonable.       Choose two kinds of inequality, each of which varies      considerably in its intensity. For each kind choose one      example that has low inequality and another that has high      inequality. These four examples, two with low inequality to      compare with two having high inequality, will be the basis of the      analysis. These may come from the same historical and      cultural setting or from different ones.             For each kind of inequality, if it is not a system of       inequality but a component, result, or instance of a system of       inequality, the analysis should stress the system.        For example, if we start with two unequal occupations, we       would say that they are in most cases not a system of       inequality but a part of one. So, we could shift our       attention to the system of occupational inequality. Or,       if we begin with the inequality between women and men within       the financial industry, we could move to the general       inequality between the sexes.        In general, an example of inequality that is a component,       result, or instance of a system of inequality may have       particularistic causes that seem sufficient to account for its       contours or variations. However, we expect its existence       is derivative of the relevant system of inequality and that it       and other similar instances that are derivative of the same       system of inequality are all subject to the causal processes       that generate and sustain that system of inequality.        Thus, an effort to identify and make sense of the causal       processes cannot look at the component or instance alone.                   Describe each kind of inequality and the difference between the      higher and lower inequality instances.             As always, describe who are distinguished by the inequality,       and what it is that is unequal.        Specify why we consider the inequality in one instance to be       significantly higher than in the other. This is a       measurement issue on the surface, but commonly has deeper       implications about what the inequality means.                   Comparing the instances of high inequality with those of low      inequality, construct a series of hypotheses about about the      possible causes of high inequality (compared to low      inequality). In some cases these hypotheses may apply to      both kinds of inequality similarly while in others they are quite      different \u2013 try to be clear about this. For each      hypothesis, explain the reasoning behind your speculation.       In attempting to generate hypotheses representing a systematic      analysis, among other things to think about, you might consider:             the origins of each example of inequality (e.g., do the high       and low inequality instances arise from distinctive conditions       that relate to their subsequent intensity)        the history of changes in levels of inequality if applicable       and known (e.g., does knowledge of their varying intensities       over time suggest anything about why or how they differ in the       instances you compare?0        political and legal contexts        ideological and cultural contexts        relationships to other forms of inequality        direct relationships between those advantaged and those       disadvantaged by the inequality        how individuals' statuses are decided        ... Each of the foregoing refer to important aspects of an       inequality system that imply the existence of some causal       process. Looking back over the previous topics we have       examined should give more facets of inequality calling for a       similar causal analysis.                   Moving beyond hypotheses, see which of these more general      questions you can begin to answer.              Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by the outcomes of       self-interested actions of individuals and organizations.        Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by its functional and       structural relationships to important social arrangements or       \"needs.\"        Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by some competitive       processes.        Try to be self-conscious about the comparisons being made,       implicit or explicit, and what alternatives might be possible.              Try not to forget that inequality induces processes,       conditions, and structures that limit resistance's       effectiveness and part of its explanation lies in the ways       this obstruction or resistance works.                   In short , our      analytical goal is to generate ideas about what produces      inequality, by first looking at what seems to explain variations      in the degree of severity of two types of inequality.

XIV. What makes some forms of inequality more    important than others to the organization of social structure and the    patterns of human action?     Some have argued that class dominates in particular societies or all    societies. Others have suggested that gender inequality is the most    fundamental inequality. Putting aside grand claims, most would agree    that some kinds of inequality have greater influence over the organization    of a society (or other social entity) and the history of that    organization. How we can systematically assess the relative    importance of different kinds of inequality and what decides their    differential importance are not clear.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: To be added       Select four kinds of inequality that are widespread within a      society or some other boundaried social context (such as an      organization or social category).       Try to rank these examples of in equality in terms of their      relative importance.             Note that different criteria for \"importance\" can result in       different rankings. One goal is to identify what       criteria for importance make sense for the chosen       examples.        Note that the importance of an inequality may vary by time       period, by type of people, by location in another system of       inequality, and other differentiating conditions.        Thus, a careful assessment will commonly result in a series       of rankings for the relative importance of the inequality       example, with the rankings distinguished by the criteria for       importance used and by the circumstances that mediate the       evaluations for any specific criterion.        To be systematic, one will usually want to rewrite the       analysis of relative importance organized around the       conditioning criteria                   Having assessed the relative importance of the inequality      examples, try to explore what caused the rankings. In the      foregoing, we are focusing on description and measurement.       Here the concern is causality. Above we are trying to      establish why and when we might call one kind of inequality more      important than another, a conceptual and empirical exercise.       Here we are asking what it is about the content, configuration and      history of the inequalities that results in one having more      importance than the other.             One path to answering this question might be to consider       known empirical examples where the relative importance of the       types of inequality being considered have a different ranking       importance.        Another path to answering might be to imagine what it would       take to lower the importance of the higher ranked inequality       or raise the importance of the lower ranked one.

How does resistance by subordinate groups work?     &amp;    People do not enjoy the lower status, fewer rewards, subjection to    authority, and other disadvantages attached to being at the lower end of    a system of inequality. This may result in anything between a    mild, occasional resentment and a continuous, burning hatred with    their fate. Fear, identification with the system, search for    praise from those above, or hope for personal advancement may induce    some to conform as much as possible with the expectations of the    advantaged. Still, wherever inequality exists, resistance    exists.          Analytical      Task                   Analytical task: Resistance       Select two examples of inequality. In each case, how do the      disadvantaged resist?       While identifying resistance, consider &lt;              everyday, commonly repeated actions of the disadvantaged        unusual, more extreme individual actions by some       disadvantaged        collective or organized forms of resistance                    What conditions, rules, processes, and actions limit      resistance? To recognize these obstacles, consider why the      identified forms of resistance are not more common, more      extreme, or more effective?

A system of inequality is a \"system.\" From a functionalist    perspective, its persistence requires mechanisms to ensure conformity to    its rules and expectations, to recruit adequate personnel to sustain    operation, to preserve commitment of those in advantaged statuses and    limit rebellion from others, and so forth. From a structuralist    perspective, it will induce latent conflicts that must be contained, it    will require legitimating ideology, it must enforce unequal effort and    unequal rewards, and so forth. A system of inequality has    structure, it has processes that occur over time, it has mechanisms to    sustain itself. Are there ways we can conceive these elements that    allow us to talk with a common language about the structural logics of    diverse systems of inequality?          Analytical      Task                  Analytical task .       Select and list five or more       distinctive systems of inequality .

As usual, briefly describe each system of inequality.       Who are included, what is unequally distributed, who are      advantaged or disadvantaged, and the like. If you are      going to consider a subset of a larger system of inequality, be      clear about what you are doing and why.

What are general dimensions of inequality systems, by which we can    characterize, compare, and categorize them?     Generally, researchers and theorists treat different kinds of    inequalities as if they existed in distinct and unrelated    conceptual worlds, although they might empirically overlap in concrete    historical settings. Various empirical instances of racial    inequality are compared, as are different instances of income inequality    or organizational hierarchies, but divergent kinds of inequality each    get their own, independent analytic turf. The divisions between    \"kinds\" of inequality are not the result of any systematic logic, but    treated as self-evident, natural distinctions.

[part 2]     Continuing the analysis of interests.          Analytical      Task                   Analytical Task 2 on Interests       Taking into account the insights and concerns developed in the       Common Readings listed below, write a critical review of      Jackson's effort to use interests as a theoretical device and      analytical tool in the studies of class and gender inequality      listed above.                           How      to write a critical review                  Although scholars spend much time and effort writing critiques      of published work, and graduate students spend even more,      systematic treatments of the criteria for, and strategies      toward, good critiques are rare. Here are just a few points to      consider.        A critique can never be better than its author's      understanding of the work being criticized. And a reader      cannot appreciate the intent of the critique beyond their grasp      of the critic's reading of the original work. This means      that to write a good critical review, we must first be sure we      understand what we are criticizing and, second, we must present      a clear summary of that understanding as part of our critique.       Although there are important exceptions, most critical reviews      really are elaborations of the answer to a simple      question. After reading the piece, do I, the critic, find      the argument worthwhile or not? However elaborate or      simple, with whatever style of presentation, the review is      largely an effort to present a sustained defense of that      evaluation.       A good review is always fair. We should never shy from      identifying a flaw or calling a mistake what it is. But we      should always try to use the language and tone that we hope      reviewers will use when they reveal the similar failings in our      work.              We review manuscripts, articles, and books. We do       not review people. Brilliant scholars write dim       papers \u2013 they are not dim as a result. A wise reviewer       avoids referring to the author, and concentrates on the       strengths and weaknesses of the work being reviewed.        For example, saying that \"the arguments in the last and       first sections contradict each other\" is preferable to       saying \"in the last section, the author contradicts what she       said in the first section\". Attributing thoughts and       intentions to an author is worse. Sitting in judgment       of the author's intellect, effort, or morality is       worst.                      As reviewers, we commonly want to be clear about two       interpretations of what has been accomplished in the work       being reviewed: that of the author and that of the       reviewer. Sometimes these will be the same; often not.        A critic has no obligation to share the author's view       of the what has been done in the work. But the       scholarly critic does have an obligation to grasp and       accurately present the author's aims and orientation as they       are conveyed in the work.        When an author sees a review, the author should not feel       (1) the reviewer has said or implied I said something that I       never said or implied or (2) the reviewer has said or       implied that I failed to consider something that is       explicitly part of my presentation.        Good scholars do not mind critical reviews, even highly       critical ones, that are accurate and fair. Good       scholars despise reviews that are inaccurate or unfair, even       if they are positive.                    What a review covers depends on the review's purpose, the      audience, and the content and quality of the work being      reviewed. No possible recipe of ingredients will apply to      all or even most reviews. The closest we can come to this      is to list common elements of reviews, understanding that the      reviewer must judge what weight, if any, each merits in a      particular review. Some of these common elements to      consider in reviews include:              Does the work have a central thesis, argument or claim       that is clear, relatively unambiguous, fully presented,       logically consistent, and not inherently flawed?        Does the work adequately consider alternative arguments?        Does the work provide evidence that effectively supports       the advocated claim over alternative claims?                Is the evidence well chosen, properly gathered, and        effectively analyzed (or is the work methodologically        sound)?         How compelling is the evidence?                       Does the work neglect or misconstrue some relevant       research or theory in ways that raise questions and       significantly diminish confidence in its claims?        Are there serious logical flaws or gaps in the analysis?        Overall, is the argument compelling?        Overall, is the analysis a valuable contribution?        Or, does it have something to say that is worth       saying?                                       Common Readings      Recommended     Readings                  Wikipedia, \" Prisoner's       dilemma \"                      Related     Readings                  ...       ...                                 *. What is the theoretical natural state: is it inequality or    equality that should be explained?     Sometimes a seemingly tangential question has the potential to gain us    unexpected insights. At least since Rousseau wrote the on the    origins of inequality we have been able to conceive that either equality    or inequality may be considered the problem to explain. While    modern sociology attributes little explanatory value to ideas about the    natural state of humankind, we may still hope to enhance our    understanding by juxtaposing efforts to identify the social mechanisms    responsible for inequality with those aimed at specifying the mechanisms    that induce equality.

This is a continuation of the previous week's topic          Analytical      Task                  Analytical task . Rewrite analytical task of      last week.       While rewriting, pay particular attention to the clear      identification of the systems of inequality. The examples      used may be a subset of a system, a particular context in a      system, or a location that is the intersection of two      systems. Try to clarify this as much as possible.       Try to think about what is unequal, and who are all the people      or all the positions that are related to those in the example      (and each other) by the inequality in the example.       Recall that some examples of inequality amongst people are      more appropriately understood as the effects of a system of      inequality. If people have different quality housing as a      result of income inequality, we usually want to conceive of this      as an effect of income inequality, rather than analyzing housing      inequality as a system of inequality. The \"system\" of      inequality is where the causal dynamics between the advantaged      and disadvantaged are centered. There is no hard and fast      rule about the proper way to define a system of inequality,      because the optimal way of understanding an inequality will      depend on our analytical goals                      Common Readings           Review readings of past weeks                      Recommended     Readings                  Review readings of past weeks       ...
