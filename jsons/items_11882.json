[{"detail": [{"content": "Feasting on the Future: Food at the New York World's Fair, 1939-1940  Eve Jochnowitz    Mr Grover Whalen N.Y. World's Fair New York City  Dear Mr. Whalen:-  I just must take the time out and let you know how happy I  am because you selected such a typical American as Kate Smith to  sing at the opening of THE FAIR, and I only wish that finances  would permit my being there. I do not think you could have found a more AMERICAN person  than Kate Smith - after all this is AMERICA the fair emblematic  of what AMERICANS CAN DO, and Kate Smith emphasizes AMERICA in  her song, praise of the country, its products, its art and music  - in fact is she not THE MOST TYPICAL PUBLIC AMERICAN  ENTERTAINER? She has the seriousness that is needed, and I only  wish that we had more \"Kate Smiths\" in America - people who  would talk their country, pat it on the back, as well as our  American made products - from soil to tapestries. It would even  be a good idea if some of our monied people would think that  American Home Furnishings, American investments, American  Scenery, etc. were BETTER than that of Foreign Lands, or makes. I certainly take my hat off to you for your selection, and  also to Kate Smith for her PERSONIFICATION of American Ideals. Much success for a 1940 Fair and I only wish I could be  there for the opening.  Yours for a successful season,  CC to Kate Smith    Mrs. A. Freeland         Rock Island, IL  (New York World's Fair 1939-1940 collection, Rare Books and  Manuscripts Division of the New York Public Library: Box 253.  Emphases and punctuation are in the original.1)   Trylon and Perisphere, the gleaming spire and globe that  became symbols of the New York World's Fair of 1939-40 and  appeared on countless World's Fair souvenirs, served as  constant reminders of the fair's message of optimism, hope for  the future, and valorization of the \"typical American.\"  Perisphere, \"the largest globe ever made by man,\" symbolized  the world we live in (with all its typicality), and Trylon, a  slender three-sided tower 700 feet tall, symbolized our  aspirations for the future.2  The food-related exhibits of the New York World's Fair  pressed the fair's official aim to present an optimistic view  of the future and its unofficial practice of honoring all that  was typically American. I will argue that in the process, the  fair's diverse exhibits created a feminized vision of the  future--a future in which women, in their many roles as food  providers, would shape their families into typical American  consumers and make the country safe for American manufacturers.  This paper will examine the food exhibits at the New York  World's Fair in relation to these themes. Part I explores the  role of food in defining \"future\" and \"typical.\" Part II  examines exhibits of food production--the farm and the factory- -in which futuristic technology would produce more \"typical\"  results. Part III, the heart of the paper, moves into the  kitchen, where the typical and the future meet in the typical  American housewife, the unsung heroine of the whole fair, who  harnesses the technology of the future to do her bidding. Part  IV discusses the exhibits devoted to manners and deportment,  which made the American table a site where Americans of all  kinds could become more typical by correcting their behaviour.  The New York World's Fair Corporation, headed by the  dashing Grover Whelan,3 selected the forward-looking theme of  \"Building the World of Tomorrow\" to be the fair's unifying  narrative, and made the celebration of the 150th anniversary of  George Washington's inauguration the putative occasion of the  fair.  The layout of the fairgrounds, which were located at the  Corona Dumps4 in Flushing Queens, followed the model of the  Great Mall in Washington, D. C. The New York City Hall  Pavilion anchored the west end of the mall, and the Court of  Peace, crowned by the United States Federal Government  Pavilion, was the anchor at the east end. In the center, and  visible from almost anywhere in the 1200 acre fairgrounds,  Trylon and Perisphere rose shimmering over their reflecting  pool. Seven zones, all of which had some food-related  exhibits, were arranged around the themes of government,  community interests, food, communications, medicine, production  and distribution, and amusement. The Federal Government Pavilion was in the Government  Zone5(see map), which included the pavilions of the states and  the foreign countries exhibiting at the fair. Many of the  foreign government pavilions offered as their main attraction  restaurants serving dishes representing their national  cuisines. In the Community Interest Zone, whose centerpiece  was the \"Town of Tomorrow,\" home-related exhibits such as gas,  furnishings, and radio shared space with the Temple of Religion  and the Jewish Palestine Pavilion. Exhibits in the Community  Interest Zone displayed technological and social advances in  kitchen work, kitchen design, and deportment intended to  improve cooking at home and dining at home in the future. Cafe  Tel Aviv, serving \"Palestine type dishes,\" was part of the  Jewish Palestine Pavilion. Immediately to the south stood the  Food Zone, where the pavilions for Borden, Swift, Heinz and  other industrial food exhibitors held their exhibits and  performances. To the west were zones for communication,  medicine, and transportation, and production and distribution,  where exhibits for Con Edison, Westinghouse, U. S. Steel, and  General Electric, among others, showed the wonders that  electrically powered kitchen equipment and modern kitchen  materials would bring to food preparation in the factory and  the home. A large Amusement Zone, with many restaurants of its  own, flanked the fair to the south, but had no place on the  Constitution Mall. A \"focal exhibit\" in each zone related that  particular zone to the World of Tomorrow. The focal exhibits  were designed by the Fair Corporation, while other buildings  were the responsibility private exhibitors. The broad and  didactic focal exhibits were unpopular, and in the second year  of the fair, all the focal exhibits closed and private exhibits  took their place.   A World's Fair is a temporary universe. Feasting on the  Future will examine the stated and unstated aims of the New  York World's Fair of 1939-1940 through the most temporary of  artefacts, food.    Notes 1. Most of the primary material for this paper is from the  correspondence and files of the New York World's Fair, courtesy  of the New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden  Foundations, Rare Books and Manuscripts Division, New York  World's Fair Records 1939-40. Material from the Astor, Lenox  and Tilden collection will hereafter be identified by the  letters NYPL and box number. 2. Trylon and Perisphere were proper names. Contemporaneous  sources were inconsistent, many referring to them as \"the  Trylon\" and \"the Perisphere.\" I have used them as names  throughout. 3. A history of Grover Whelan's peculiar and often disastrous  career as a director of exhibitions is beyond the scope of this  paper, but it is necessary to mention the dashing Mr. Whelan's  extraordinary animal magnetism, which permeates all accounts.  Letters from women and men to the fair, such as the letter I  chose as the epigraph to this paper, were frequently addressed  to Whelan personally, and filled with the warmest sentiments.  Much of the glamour associated with this particular fair was  Whelan's own. 4. Mayor LaGuardia had hoped that the fair would allow the  city to reclaim the Corona Dumps as a public park. Because of  the outbreak of World War II, the city had to postpone plans  for the park until another World's Fair, in the years 1964-65,  revived the area again. 5. I will use the capitalization conventions of the World's  Fair Corporation throughout.     PART I: Typical Americans: Perfection or Abjection?  \"Makes you proud of your country\" was the slogan of Elmer1,  mascot of the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940, and a symbol  of the typical American visitor. The source of pride is the  fair itself. Almost every exhibit and performance at the Fair,  from the pageants led by Mayor LaGuardia and Grover Whelan to  the recipe pamphlets, valorized the \"typical American.\" In the  second year of the fair, when Europe was at war, typical  Americans were themselves on display. Families from each of  the forty-eight states entered contests run by their local  newspapers to select the most typical representatives of each  state. Entrants submitted essays in which they explained why  they were typical, and winners came to live at the fair for one  week in one of the two model homes set up on the fairgrounds.  Each \"typical American family\" was presented with a one-week  lease and keys to their home by Harvey Gibson, the vice- president of the fair. Dad was always handed the lease, Mom,  the keys. Each typical American family posed for photographs  as they moved in, moved out and raised their state flag. Upon  departure, each \"typical American boy\" received a baseball  autographed by Babe Ruth. Each \"typical American girl\" got a  bracelet.  A publicity photo from the fair shows Grover Whalen, the  president of the fair, and Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia greeting  the first two typical American families to arrive at the fair.  Ironically, Mayor LaGuardia could, in his ceremonial capacity,  welcome typical families to the Fair, but his family would  never have qualified as typical. No Italian-American families  won the contest for the typical American family, nor, for that  matter, did any Black or Jewish families. All of the winning  families, two from each of the 48 states, were white and had a  mother, father and two kids. These mobile and arguably  exhibitionist families were families of the future in more ways  than the fair's planners could have known.2  Black, Jewish and Italian Americans, excluded from exhibits  of typicality, appeared on a \"Wall of Fame\" for \"Notable  Americans of Foreign Birth, Negroes and American Indians\"(NYPL  box 252). The notable Americans who made it onto the wall were  sorted by country of origin and field of endeavor. Negroes and  American Indians were included in their own categories, but no  separate category was created for Jews of foreign birth.3  The Wall of Fame committee was navigating troubled waters.  In 1939, with immigration severely restricted and war  approaching, very few were going on record to say anything good  about Americans of foreign birth. By honoring immigrants,  Negroes and American Indians, the Wall of Fame made the case  that the diversity of American achievement was no threat to  American typicality. The Wall of Fame committee tried to  distribute immigrants evenly by country and field, while  representing groups proportionally to their population. They  also had to make do with whatever actual notables they had to  work with. One memo in the Wall of Fame files states  regretfully that many German scientists had to be left out  because there were simply more than enough Germans represented  in the field of science.  Not everyone born in a particular country was considered  representative of that country, whether in their own eyes or in  the eyes of their fellow countrymen. A Mr. Frgosa protested  that there were only five Portuguese honored on the Wall of  Fame, and that all five of them were Jews. His letter, which  the committee forwarded to Father Joseph Carrella of St.  Anthony's Welfare Center, dramatizes the problem of grouping  immigrants by country. Father Carrella distanced himself and  the Portuguese community of New York from the letter writer, a  well known \"trouble maker.\" \"This man,\" wrote Father Carrella,  \"means nothing to the Portuguese. We are satisfied with the  names of the Portuguese Jews,\" he continues, \"because the  Portuguese Jews and the Portuguese were the first settlers in  the city of New York and we are proud of their record\" (NYPL  box 252). Should Jews have had a separate category? Some members of  the Committee for Jewish Palestine felt it was prudent to be  restrained about exhibiting Jewish achievement.4 No doubt  Jewish fairgoers combed through names on the Wall of Fame as  obsessively as did Frgosa to find notable Jews from various  countries. While they would not have found a category set  aside for Jews, they would have found many Jewish names, as  there was apparently no effort to limit their numbers. In  addition to comprising the entire Portuguese delegation to the  wall, Jews, with one exception, made up the entire Polish  delegation as well as most of the pared-down selection of  Germans.  In contrast to the display of typical Americans at the  fair, the Wall of Fame honored well-known individuals, such as  Samuel Goldwyn and Albert Einstein, whose fame and  extraordinary contributions made them remarkable. To win a  place on the Wall of Fame, immigrants had to be outstanding,  and their names familiar. To win the Typical Family Contest,  the families had to be ordinary. Honored Americans thus fell  into the mutually exclusive categories of typical natives and  exceptional immigrants. The exceptional achievements of non- natives were thus located in the past, while typical and  undistinguished families provided models for the future--if not  models in achievement, then models as consumers. However much the fair celebrated the typical American,  internal memos of the food committee show that the fair's  planners did not think the typical American was all that smart.  They planned the food displays accordingly. Larry K. Herzog,  who began organizing the fair's food exhibits in 1937, seems to  have had two main goals in assembling the food exhibitors:  First, to promote American industry in a time of economic  depression, and second to advance the education of \"The  average American,\" a paradigmatic individual for whom he  apparently had no great regard. In a 1937 letter to the editor  of Baker's Weekly, Herzog wrote, \"I am trying so hard to  provide a basis for the food exhibitors to help us in helping  themselves as well to push back the mental horizon of consumer  understanding as related to food\" (NYPL box 150). He  complained that the \"average housewife\" did not know about half  of the baked products available in America, and \"All the  average person thinks about\" is the finished food product  rather than the process of manufacture. Herzog's goals of  education and promotion are inextricably linked to consumption  in all the exhibits that ultimately took shape at the fair.  The average American, enlightened by the fair's educational  exhibits and warmed to American industry would become an ideal  consumer. Beatrice Mabry, director of the educational section of the  food exhibit, sought to put together suitable instruction for  informed consumers of the future. \"Does the average individual  consume approximately a ton of food a year?\" She wrote to Dr.  Louis Stanley of the United States Department of Agriculture on  March 13, 1937, \"if not, what amount? What does the human  stomach hold--a pint, a pint and a half or what\"(NYPL box 150)?  The final result of Mabry's research was a scale model of  Manhattan Island in Russell Wright's focal food exhibit with  skyscrapers and piles of food showing how much food Americans  consumed in a day. The purpose of the model buildings was to  convey the enormity of scale. Herzog and Mabry hoped that such  simple visual metaphors could educate consumers about food  painlessly, but the sight of a pile of food next to a  skyscraper turned out not to be as appealing to the public as  they might have wished.  The same combination of earnest yet wacky didacticism  continued throughout the food pavilion. Exhibits in the focal  food exhibit used surreal visual metaphors to explain the  miracles of futuristic food technology. Wright intended these  vivid and colorful images to make the scientific and industrial  aspects of food manufacture seem warm and wholesome. Display  cases held flying lobsters, an aqueduct squirting roses into  the desert, an alligator pear (avocado) with five jewels, an  eye winking in a cave, a clock running backward inside a tin  can and a cauliflower wearing boxing gloves knocking out a  centipede. No labels accompanied the exhibit. A recorded  voice, when it was working, explained that the flying lobsters  represented the miracle of refrigerated transportation, the  roses stood for modern irrigation, the jewels in the avocado  symbolized such ordinary things and vitamins and fats, the eye  stood for the vitamin cure for night-blindness, the clock in  the can showed how canning made time stand still for fresh food  and of course the cauliflower protected by pesticides defeated  parasitic vermin. Unfortunately, the recorded voice was not  always working, causing one student of display to note wryly  that \"The mystery of those aerial crustaceans was wearing us  down\" (Cummings 1940, 94). The humor in these whimsical  displays made the case to potential consumers that  technological food manufacture was not cold and forbidding, but  friendly and inviting. The fair planners felt strongly that visitors needed  exactly this kind of gentle instruction to make the country  safe for industrial food manufacturers and their internal memos  show that there was a wide gulf between what they wished to  show typical Americans to be and what the fair's planners  thought typical Americans actually were. In spite of drawing  better crowds than any of the other focal exhibits, the focal  food exhibit received mixed reviews and closed in 1940, as did  the other focal exhibits, to make way for the Coca-Cola  pavilion. The focal food exhibit's designers were not alone in their  urgent desire to improve the unschooled eating practices of  average Americans. Not only America's scientists, but also the  clergy felt that uninformed eating was a threat not only to  health, but to morality, religion, and the nation's future. In  \"Man's future depends on what he decides to eat,\" Scientific  Monthly concluded that \"Not enough of us are making the three- times-a-day decision as wisely as might be\" (\"Man's future  depends\" 1938, 374).  \"The churches are in the midst of an all but losing fight  with the restaurants for the souls of men.\" was the alarmed  cry of the Zion Herald: Organ of American Methodism, which  argued that a startling number of souls had been \"damned by bad  food\" (\"Food and Religion\" 1939, 38). The hurried thoughtless  eating so typical in America was to the Herald very much a  moral issue as well as a health issue. The Organ of American  Methodism would not have used the word \"damned\" lightly. The  same urgency felt by their contemporaries the Italian futurists  informs the argument of the scientists and the clergy.5  Food corporations that exhibited at the fair took up the  fight for better informed eating in the recipe booklets that  were distributed free at their pavilions at the fair. The  Sealtest recipe pamphlet for the World's Fair includes a short  essay by Professor R. B. Stoltz of Ohio State University that  manages to address concerns about health and morality in its  promotion of milk as a beverage for adults: The typical American, when handed a menu to designate  his choice of beverages, usually replies, \"I'll take  milk.\" This is true for all seasons of the year. The 130  million people, who live in the United States, do not  realize how milk conscious we are. Almost unknowingly we  appreciate the food value of milk and its effect upon our  physical, mental and moral acts. . . .  In most foreign countries milk is not considered a  beverage for the adults. Neither do those adults usually  have the pep, initiative and enthusiasm that can be found  in a group of typical Americans (Sealtest Inc. 1939, 11).  A \"Professor,\" a scientific spokesperson for the future,  not an old-fashioned chef or a farmer, endorses milk. His  arguments in favor of milk are very much in line with the  fair's elevation of typical Americans. Because typical  Americans do drink milk, Americans should drink milk. The  descriptive is prescriptive. Furthermore, foreigners drink  less milk than Americans and they are the worse for it  physically, mentally, and morally. Sealtest was correct in  predicting that with war imminent, their customers would want  to approximate the typical American and not the unspecified,  lackluster foreigner.  Elmer and Mrs. Modern: Two views for the Future  Elmer the typical American is a particularly rich, if  conflicted, symbol. Elmer is a middle-aged white male. He  wears a striped three-piece suit with a watch chain in his vest  pocket. His ample build, slightly unfashionable suit and hat,  and unflagging joviality point to the out-of-town origins of  this small town businessman at this New York fair. \"Elmer-- Jolly, average, everyday American--is being immortalized in  countless posters this year sounding the keynote of informality  and country fair spirit of the World's Fair of 1940\" (NYPL box  1496). Elmer is meant to be a typical visitor to the fair, not  the typical New Yorker. He is photographed greeting  celebrities, eating hot dogs and baking strawberry shortcake,  but he usually poses with thumbs in vest sleeves--An American  mudra for prosperity and contentment. Elmer was hugely  popular, still, no one would want to be like Elmer, whom the  Sayre, Pennsylvania Evening Times described in one editorial  as \"Plump, moist and a bit of a chump\" (\"We are not a nation of  Elmers\" 1940, n.p.). The editorial states that Americans are  not \"gullible\" like Elmer. The editors clearly read Elmer's  signifiers of typicality as signifiers of gullibility.  A river of difference flowed between New York, host city to  the fair, and the rest of the country, whence the typical  Americans displayed at the fair came. The fair chose to locate  Americanness outside of the big city in an attempt to appeal to  the whole country. While official literature at the fair  ignored the tension, outside sources documented it gleefully.  The cartoons in Trylongs and Perisites (O'Leahy 1939) suggest  how many New Yorkers must have viewed the swarms of out-of-town  visitors descending on the city to visit the fair. Out-of-  towners in the cartoons have long, pointed beaks that look like  Trylon, and spherical heads that look like Perisphere, the  symbols of the fair. Trylongs and Perisites lampoons out-of- town guests and the discomforts of keeping them. A couple eat  their breakfast in the nude as an indignant \"Perisite\" stalks  out the door, her provincial prudery used against her, in \"How  to get rid of a maiden aunt,\" and a graveyard filled with  stones shaped like Trylon and Perisphere contains one with the  inscription: \"Friends And Relations With Me Would Stay/ To Hail  The Dawn of A New Day./ I Had to Steal And Beg And Borrow/ Now  I'm In The World of Tomorrow (O'Leahy 1939, n.p.). The editors  of the Evening News were not wrong to guess that in spite of  the enthusiastic language welcoming visitors and stressing the  virtues of all-American small-town typicality, the fair's  planners and New Yorkers themselves might have held typical  Americans in some disdain. Elmer, the typical American, is clearly marked as an  American of the past. There is no one poster persona analogous  to Elmer for the American of the future, but all the prototypes  for future Americans performed at the fair were gendered  female. In 1939, the Community Interest focal exhibit sought to  show the interdependence of all modern Americans. \"Mrs.  Modern,\" an animated figure, made telephone calls to order all  the elements of her house, down to the ingredients for dinner.  The act of building the physical house itself, surely a  masculine task in the American imagination, became an act of  female consumption. The wife became the complete \"homemaker\"  right down to the physical construction of the house. Harvey  Gibson acknowledges the supremacy of the female homemaker when  he hands the lease of the fair's model home to the Typical  American Husband, but hands the keys to the Typical American  Wife. The fair's food and home-related exhibits called upon  the woman, as the head of consumer choices in her home, to lead  homesteading on the next frontier, the technological age.   In 1939, the future could not come soon enough. The  period between the world wars was a time of great anxiety about  the future of the food supply. Even before the Depression, in  the prosperous decade of the twenties, the country was seized  by fears that either the world was running out of food, or that  average Americans simply would not eat what was good for them  (Levenstein 1988, 176). The food exhibits at the New York  World's Fair of 1939-1940 reassured fairgoers that in the  World of Tomorrow, thanks to the chemist's flask and the  housewife's telephone, there would be plenty of food to go  around and it would be readily available. Educational exhibits  showed Americans how to partake of the food of the future. The  technology of tomorrow would make the drudgery of cooking and  housework obsolete. The average middle-class housewife, who  could no longer depend on servants as she had in the previous  century would now have \"mechanical servants\" to do her  bidding (Rydell 1993, 124). Fairgoers would learn how to  remake themselves even as they remade America for the future  particularly through food, cooking, and eating.    Notes to Part I 1. Leslie Oestereicher, a heavy-set man in his mid-forties,  posed for most of the Elmer images.  2. Robert Rydell identifies this and other world's fair  exhibits with an ominous eugenicist agenda on the part of the  exhibition committees (Rydell 1993, 38-60 and passim). Rydell  is correct that racism played a role in the decisions of the  selection committee, but he misses the point that the typical  American families are a self-selected group whose desire to be  typical was their own.   3. While this is not a paper about the display of Jews in  particular at the world's fair, it is useful to examine the  display issues concerning Jews because of the anomalous  category they form. 4. Dr S. Margoshes wrote of those who were uncomfortable with  these exhibits, \"Still others wondered whether a Jewish exhibit  showing the colossal Jewish contributions to America would not  have the effect of arousing more \"rishus\" by affording an  opportunity to our enemies to renew their contention that the  Jews were in control of the U. S.\" (NYPL box 211).  5. Discourse at the New York World's Fair and in the  contemporary American press on the future of food and eating in  America might provide a worthwhile mirror for Filippo  Marinetti's Futurist Cookbook:  The Futurist culinary revolution has the lofty, noble  and universally expedient aim of changing radically the  eating habits of our race, strengthening it, dynamizing it  and spiritualizing it with brand new food combinations. .  . Until now men have fed themselves like ants, rats, cats  or oxen. . . . It is not by chance that this work is  published during a world economic crisis, which has  clearly inspired a dangerous and depressing panic. . . .  We propose as an antidote to this panic a Futurist way of  cooking, that is: optimism at the table (Marinetti 1932,  21). Often treated as a joke and its more outrageous recipes quoted  out of context, The Futurist Cookbook touches on concerns that  made many Americans in the 1930's uneasy about food and eating.  Marinetti's image of men feeding themselves like rats or oxen  is not so different from the disdain of the New York World's  Fair's planning committees toward the average American when it  came to food.     Part II The Future of Farm and Factory  At previous American expositions the privileged site for  any food display was the farm. The World Colombian Exposition  of 1893 in Chicago featured a Corn Palace, a knight made of  prunes, and an elephant made entirely of walnuts (Longone  1994). By 1939, ingenious displays of abundant produce were  displaced by dazzling displays farm technology. The focal  exhibit on food displayed the benefits of modern irrigation and  pesticides (represented by a cauliflower wearing boxing  gloves). The Electrified Farm exhibit demonstrated modern  farming equipment and techniques. The Electric Light and Power  Company's \"Olde Dairy Farm\" exhibit, showed women in hoop  skirts hand-milking cows and toting heavy milk-pails. Such  displays demonstrated the kind of farm work that was not to be  part of the World of Tomorrow, and provided a contrast to the  effortless work of the future. Exhibits of working women set  up the same dichotomy between kitchen work of the past and  future, as I will show in the next section.   Fresh From the Factory   The farm, however, was merely a footnote. The food of  tomorrow was to come from the American factory. The New York  Times predicted in 1938 that an entirely synthetic food supply  might soon make the laboratory the primary source of American  food (\"An entirely synthetic supply\" 1938, 16). \"Will the  Chemist's Flask do the Work of 1000 Farms?\" asked a display  that showed an agricultural landscape inside a flask. To ask  the question was to answer it. The optimistic response this  question elicited from the fairgoer was yes. In 1939, the idea  that all the food of the future might be synthetic was good  news. Most prognostications about the future of food in the  1930s were grim alarms about an approaching famine and  possibility of widespread starvation because of uncontrollable  population growth. In truth, in the 1930s millions of people in  the United States were severely undernourished with no clear  relief in sight (Levenstein 1993, 4). Exhibiting mass- production of factory food suited the fair perfectly. The mass  production of food in model factories would not only save  America from hunger, but would also do so while mirroring the  streamlined aesthetics of Futurama and Democracity. National  brands such as Wonder Bread produced consistency that made it  possible for Americans to eat identical, and typically  American, food everywhere. Industrialized food streamlined  regional and ethnic differences.  The love affair between the fair and industrial food  manufacturers began in the very earliest stages of planning,  when Larry Herzog wrote to the Chicago Board of Trade: I am particularly interested in getting across to the  ultimate consumer visitor the real story behind the static  packaged foods on the shelves at the grocer's store.  People have no conception of these things; all the average  person thinks about is the farm at one end and the  grocery store at the other, but the amount of capital,  investment, brain, brawn, courage and gamble that lies  between these two terminal points is to them a closed  book (NYPL box 149). Almost every food exhibit made the process of food manufacture  transparent, and emphasized the realness of the process  displayed. Just as the \"real skeleton\" in the Hall of Man drew  visitors, and actual fetuses were on display,1 the look  through, the look inside, the almost illicit glimpse behind the  scenes was an irresistible draw for amusement seekers in 1939- 1940. The Hall of Medicine provided a look inside virtual  human bodies, and the industrial food exhibits took visitors  inside virtual factories to see the hidden processes of  commercial food manufacture. Fairgoers loved to see what was  usually unseen, the fair's planners felt that average Americans  did not know enough about their food to be informed consumers,  and the manufacturers may have felt that fairgoers knew too  much. Industrial food manufacturers needed particularly to  exhibit themselves on their own terms to dispel consumer  uneasiness about the unknown, and to allay consumer concerns  about abuse and neglect in industrial food manufacture.  Every industrial food exhibit, whether it employed performance,  cinema, dioramas, or all three, strove above all to build  confidence among potential consumers by emphasizing the  cleanliness and safety of food manufacture. Many food  corporations felt that the official focal exhibit of the fair  did not dwell sufficiently on the processing stage in food.  Food Industries magazine referred ominously to unspecified  \"best sellers\" that had dragged food manufacturers through the  mud in print (Miller 1939, 59). The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair,  first published in 1906 and very well known in 1939, was one of  the first and most famous efforts by muckraking journalists to  reveal the inner workings of food manufacture. The best answer  to these \"best sellers,\" Miller claimed, was full disclosure of  \"how it's made\" and \"how it's done.\" Food manufacturers  needed to reveal their own inner workings and to do so on their  own terms. If only consumers could visit their factories,  they would see how sanitary and responsible they were. Model  factories at the fair allowed all who entered to see the  hygienic, even sterile, conditions in which workers processed  and packaged their products.  Beautiful young women dressed in spotless white, like  nurses or laboratory technicians, at many of the fair's food  pavilions dramatized the cleanliness and wholesomeness of the  products they presented. Swift, the meat-packing company that  had been Sinclair's primary target, peopled its plant at the  fair with young women in white lab coats who demonstrated the  wrapping of bacon and other Swift products.  These brides of science inspired confidence in the  manufacturing process by showing that food handling work was  light enough, clean enough and safe enough for women to do.  These immaculately dressed young women could hardly be  committing the wretched acts of abuse, neglect, and brutality  that Sinclair and others had exposed early in the century. By  staffing their model factories with women, the industrial food  manufacturers, like the fair's focal exhibits, feminized the  future. Just as the typical American wife, as the perfect  consumer, could build the home of tomorrow using only her  telephone, typical young women became the handmaidens of  industry once technology had shifted \"manpower\" away from the  male body and onto the machine. Even the streamlined forms of  the future were rounded and soft.  Rotating Cows and Little Bakers: Performances Produced for  the Fair  Food exhibitors at the fair had to create a show worth  seeing out of subject matter that was frequently of little  \"visual interest\" (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1991, 386). The  Borden company put cows on the \"Rotolactor,\" a merry-go-round  on which the cows stood while modern machines did the milking.  Cows standing in their stalls for milking may or may not have  drawn spectators, but the Rotolactor, even though it was the  butt of endless jokes, was a huge success. Five million  visitors came to the focal food exhibit, but almost eight  million \"stopped and ah'ed\" at the Borden Rotolactor (Miller  1940, 48). The Rotolactor was \"a ten-strike . . . designed not  to assist in the milking, but to allow a great number of people  to watch the process all at once. Watch they surely did . . .  and then not a few marched across the aisle to the salesroom to  take part in the drinking\" (Cummings 1940, 83). Food  Industries magazine cited the Borden exhibit as the best  example of the need for performance in a world's fair exhibit.  \"Almost every foot of Borden's 80,000 sq. ft. exhibit was a  show. . . . If any manufacturer failed to obtain ample returns  for the investment the blame can only be placed on his act.  He did not put on a good show\" (Miller 1940, 48). Borden also provided an ice cream factory show,  demonstrations of milk being pasteurized, irradiated and  bottled, and a pen of twenty calves, \"replaced every three  weeks to insure their being of a cute age\" (\"Food  Manufacturers' Exhibits\" 1939, 255). To guide visitors, Borden  hired \"15 girl college graduates, selected from more than 100  candidates as information girls for the Borden Company's Dairy  World of Tomorrow\" (NYPL box 149). The information girls were  graduates of Barnard, Smith, Radcliffe, Hunter and Brooklyn  College who were trained to answer \"all predictable questions  from visitors to the Borden Building.\"2 Borden was especially  proud to have among its info girls the triplets Frances,  Marguerite and Catherine Kirshner.3 In 1940 Borden added to the  above an exhibit called \"Elsie in her boudoir,\" an actual cow  standing in a bed shaped stall in a room decorated as a young  woman's bedroom. The youth, freshness and cuteness of the  calves and the information girls (although there is no mention  of how often they had to be replaced) reinforced the message  that milk is a fresh and healthful food. They were also part  of the show. The use of lovely young women by Borden, Swift  and other food companies exhibiting at the fair was not just  the same ordinary sexual exploitation indulged in at Aquacade  and other amusement zone displays at the fair, but a vision of  the feminine form of the future.  The George Washington Coffee Refining Company had \"comely  college girls demonstrating its product\" (\"Food manufacturer's  exhibits\" 1939,44). The Junket Folks boasted that their  desserts were served by attractively attired attendants.  Pretty \"info girls\" guided visitors through Borden's Dairy  World of Tomorrow. Food Industries magazine stated with  approval that pretty girls added \"drama and action\" to the  show. In its bid to attract visitors, the Loose-Wiles Sunshine  Baking company produced a musical vaudeville show for a company  of diminutive bakers. Beech-Nut made a toy circus and circus  parade the main part of its exhibit, which also included  factory demonstrations. The Heinz company, which introduced  the familiar pickle pin at the World's Colombian Exposition in  1893, had a musical revue starring a line of precision dancers  and Mr. Tomato Head, a top-hatted robot. \"Pep up with  Doughnuts\" was the theme of the well-attended demonstrations of  the Doughnut Company of America. After live performances,  color motion pictures drew the most viewers. Nabisco, Coca- Cola, and Planter's all showed movie cartoons for children  about their products. Both Coca-Cola's and Nabisco's movies  starred Mickey Mouse.  Exhibitors also used the fragrance of fresh food to draw  the curious and the hungry. Standard Brands attracted visitors  to the coffee exhibit with the aroma of coffee freshly roasted  at the roasting demonstration. Many fairgoers waited around to  buy the fragrant apple pies they had just seen assembled and  baked at Mrs. Wagner's baking company. Scent was also used by  some of the non-food exhibitors, with varying results. An  orange blossom scent filled the entire Florida pavilion. The  Coty pavilion, and for some reason the Federal pavilion, both  perfumed the air at their exhibits, making them quite  disgusting.4  Futuristic Precision: The Lost Matzo Performance of the  Fair  While matzo might not seem an exemplar of the food of the  future, the Department of Industrial Exhibits attempted,  without success, to bring a matzo baking performance to the New  York World's Fair. In April 1938, Edward Carlin of the  Department of Industrial Exhibits sent an enthusiastic letter  to Frederick Margareten at Horowitz Brothers and Margareten  with his proposal: I think that perhaps a model of your bakery, showing  the process by which your various products are made,  under the most sanitary and painstaking conditions  [emphasis in the original] with regard to both public  health and taste would make a most interesting exhibit. Carlin does not specifically mention matzo, but matzo is  the product that Horowitz baked. \"Sanitary and painstaking\"  were code words for kosher in this context. A working matzo  bakery on the fairgrounds would certainly have provided both  the educational value and the fast action the fair organizers  desired. Carlin also indicates that he was interested in  exhibiting Kashrut, a part of Jewish law that would be in  keeping with the values of the World of Tomorrow, including  cleanliness, speed, and precision. While not values most  fairgoers might associate with Jews, they were important to  consumers of the future, Jewish and non-Jewish alike. Carlin  urged Margareten to consider that \"every one of the fifty- million visitors [to the fair] is a potential buyer of your  products.\"  Horowitz Brothers and Margareten expressed only lukewarm  interest, and there is no record of matzo being present at the  fair in any form. Carlin did get his working bakery, though,  from the Continental Baking Company, which produced Wonder  Bread. Every detail of the baking process was displayed, down  to the growing and harvest of the wheat from a wheat field on  the fairgrounds. Continental's promotional material proudly  emphasized that this was New York City's first wheat field in  sixty-eight years. Just as wheat for matzo must be guarded  from the time it ripens on the stalk, the wheat for Wonder  Bread was never out of public sight. Continental encouraged  fairgoers to come back to the fair and look at the wheat during  different stages of the growing season. Penelope Shoo, the  bosomy \"scarecrow of tomorrow\" wearing a Hattie Carnegie gown,  guarded the Wonder Bread wheat field and gave it a touch of  pizzazz. You can spend as little as 20 minutes or as long as an  hour in watching the automatic process of baking bread  but, in passing through the bakery there is one thought to  keep in mind. Each single action you see, manual or  mechanical, must be timed exactly so that every loaf of  Wonder Bread will go through its 10 1/2 hour career  steadily and without interruption (NYPL box 150). The ten and a half hours required to make Wonder Bread may  not be the eighteen minutes needed to make matzo but the  exactness is what they have in common.  A Gigantic Public Service: Selling the Future of Food  The combined efforts of the food focal and . . . food  companies should convince visitors that food industries  are performing a gigantic public service, that food  processing is a highly technological and efficient  business and that people should pay some attention to  nutritional value in food products (\"Food at the World's  Fair\" 1939, 225). At the New York World's Fair, industrial food exhibitors made  their case for the future to the public.5 In the World of  Tomorrow, foods prepared in the factory would be safer, for a  public concerned about sanitation, and more plentiful and  reliable, for a public concerned with want (\"Death Cannot  Poison Food Inspected, Sterilized and Packaged\" was the  reassuring message of an exhibit about federal inspection).  Uninformed average Americans, for whom the displays were  designed, would come away from the fair with a new  understanding of the value of industrial food processing,  while mass produced and processed food would make the basis for  a new American cuisine in which all typical Americans could  partake.     Notes to Part II  1. Fetuses occupied a very different social space in 1939. A  contemporary critic said of this exhibit that \"If a flag is  good, an embryo or two would be sure fire for a big hand\"  (Cummings 1940, 24).  2. The description of the information girls, with its  emphasis on their being a very select group of recent college  graduates is almost identical to descriptions of the tour  guides at the United Nations (Tatomirovic 1985) and the famous  Harvey Girls. The fair was not alone in employing the  irresistible combination of tourism, food and beautiful women.  For more on the touristic use of uniformed lovelies, see  Tatomirovich 1985, Jochnowitz 1997, and Haber 1997.  3. The Kirshner Triplets, along with all visitors to the  Borden who chose to volunteer, were fingerprinted by the New  York City Police Department. Assured that their fingerprints  would be filed separately from those of criminals, many agreed  to try out the new experience of fingerprinting. Borden's  visitors were at once consumers of spectacle and objects of  surveillance.  4. Professor Michael Coe, personal correspondence. 5. The committee for industrial exhibits chose not to include  proposed exhibits which did not further their agenda of linking  factory produced food and the future. George Kern of Iowa did  not receive space to display his \"World Famous Petrified Ham.\"     Part III Freedom for Mrs. 1939: Cooking in the  Kitchen of Tomorrow   The World of Tomorrow will seem less utopian and more  practical to the women than perhaps it does to the men.  It fits into the dreams and wishful thinking in which  women, particularly mothers of families, have indulged for  more than a generation. . . . The fair hopes to prove it  isn't enough to install a mechanical refrigerator in one's  home. It will show how to get the best use out of that  refrigerator for cheaper, better, food and a happier and  more leisurely family life. It will even suggest cultural  and recreational programs for the employment of the  leisure time (NYPL box 209).  Exhibits that portrayed the future of the American home  situated the typical American housewife right in the World of  Tomorrow. Like previous American fairs, the 1939 New York  World's Fair had planned to set aside a Women's Pavilion. A  committee headed by Mrs. Vincent Astor took on the job of  sifting through the diverse submissions for such a pavilion.  Ultimately the committee on Women's Exhibits decided it was  better not to segregate women in their own pavilion, partly  because any such pavilion would necessarily emphasize  achievements of the past and not the contribution of women to  the World of Tomorrow. As it happened, women were more visible  at this fair, and more active behind the scenes, than at any  previous American fair, and certainly more so than at the  subsequent 1964 World's Fair in New York. Robert Moses, who  presided over the 1964 exposition, was harshly critical of  Grover Whalen's attention to women's issues in the planning of  the 1939 fair. A contemporary remembers Moses complaining that  Whelan always had \"a bunch of cuties around him and how one  would say, 'Grover, we ought to have a dress shop' and there'd  be a dress shop at the fair. Moses said something about how he  didn't want 'no goddamn babes around me'\" (Caro 1974, 815). It  is worth noting that the New York World's Fair of 1939 may have  been the only American Exposition that did have a men's  building. Man, His Clothes, His Parts was a pavilion devoted  to men's fashion and leisure, subjects that previously had been  set aside for women only. The new American woman would require  a new kind of American man.  Fairgoers could consider some of the possible roles for  this new American woman in an exhibit entitled \"Factory  Preparation Frees Mrs. 1939,\" which introduced the focal food  exhibit. The exhibit showed a well-dressed young woman  surrounded by tiny icons representing sports equipment, playing  cards, programs from concerts and a charity bazaar, a  psychoanalysis text and a ballot. The focal food exhibit echoed  the assertion of the industrial exhibits that the homemaker of  tomorrow would be an energetic and sophisticated young woman  who played sports, attended concerts, and did good works. She  would show psychological insight and civic responsibility. She  would not be an overworked unattractive drudge. Factory  preparation of food, by freeing women from drudgery, could  benefit all of society. The gradual elimination of home  cooking was to be good news for the American wife, for the  American family, and for the country itself  The Potato People Have a Job to Do: Recipes Descriptive  and Prescriptive   The general housewife does not know how to prepare and  cook mushrooms properly. With the large amount of  mushrooms now being grown, it is essential that the  housewife be educated as to how to prepare them and serve  them and with this in mind, the mushroom people  contemplate cooking and roasting their product [at the  fair] before the public. The artichoke people in California know they must  educate the general public to use artichokes. The avocado people are in the same boat and, strange  as it may seem, the potato people have a job to do.  --Letter from Joseph Sicker to B. S. Pickett of the  American Pomological Society. Feb. 28 1940 ( NYPL box 148) None of the shiny new equipment of the future, none of the  safe hygienic packaged foods displayed by manufacturers, none  of the American produce shown at the fair would do the American  family much good if no one knew how to use them, the  prerequisite to buying them. The director of fruit and  vegetable exhibits, who came on board in 1940, complained that  typical Americans, personified again as the \"general  housewife,\" do not even know how to cook a potato, let alone  such exotic produce as artichokes and avocados.  Industrial exhibitors' lively cooking demonstrations and  colorful promotional recipe pamphlets included both corporate  iconography and images from the fair in their design. Recipes  in the pamphlets fulfilled their stated aim of instructing  typical American cooks in the use of their products and their  underlying mission to increase consumption of those products.  The presence of recipes greatly increased the chances that  visitors would keep the pamphlets. In these recipes, prepared  products, such as dressings and spice combinations, stand in  for raw ingredients. They challenge the cook to show her  ingenuity in using prepared foods rather than her skill in  cooking from scratch.  In the Durkee Famous Foods Recipes for a Century of  Progress booklet, the \"sandwich loaf\" is dressed up as a  frosted layer cake. I quote this recipe in its entirety to  convey the full force of its genius and ghastliness.  Sandwich Loaf Remove crust from loaf of sandwich bread and slice  legnthwise into four layers. spread slices of bread with  Troco or Dinner Bell Margarine, then spread with desired  fillings. Here are some suggestions: RED FILLING . . . Ham finely ground, mixed with  chopped pimiento and Durkee's mayonnaise. Salmon may be  used instead of ham. YELLOW FILLING: Yolks of hard-boiled eggs, grated and  mixed with Durkee's Mayonnaise. GREEN FILLING: Sweet pickles, watercress or parsley,  olives and nuts, chopped and mixed with Durkee's  mayonnaise. WHITE FILLING: Cream cheese, grated cucumber mixed  with Durkee's mayonnaise. Tuna fish or chicken may also  be used. Put the layers together then wrap loaf tightly in damp  cloth or wax paper and chill thoroughly in refrigerator.  When ready to serve, cover the loaf with the following  mixture: Two packages of cream cheese softened with 8 oz. jar  of Durkee's Salad Aid and one teaspoon Durkee's  Worcestershire Sauce. Spread on outside of loaf as you  would ice a cake. Garnish with slices of stuffed olives,  tomatoes, lemon and sprays of parsley. Cut loaf into  slices 3/4 inch thick and serve. If desired, two kinds of bread may be used,  alternating white and whole wheat (DFF Inc. 1933).  This is a recipe for a special occasion. While the  ingredients--white bread, margarine, mayonnaise and cream  cheese--may themselves be unremarkable, the \"layer cake\" is.  What a cook performs when she prepares this sandwich loaf or  any of the many cleverly disguised recipes of this type is not  technical skill at cooking--that is merely a mechanical skill  better done by machines. Rather, she is performing creativity  and playfulness, now that she is liberated from the drudgery of  making fresh mayonnaise. The resulting sandwich-cake would be  pretty. It would also be a sodden, greasy mess. The recipe is  brilliant in its masquerade as a cake, but inconcerned with the  flavor or texture of the dish.  Similarly, the Sealtest company offered new ideas for that  familiar standby, macaroni and cheese. The Macaroni Croquettes  recipe instructed the cook to form the cooked macaroni and  cheese into balls, roll in beaten eggs and dry crumbs, and  deep-fry. Futuristic macaroni would not be served in a  shapeless pile on a plate, but in a smooth seamless space-age  sphere that recalled the architecture of the Sealtest pavilion  and Perisphere itself.  The World's Fair also authorized a cookbook of its own,  the New York World's Fair Cook Book by Crosby Gaige. The book  sweeps over the country twice, once by region and once again by  state. \"The New York World's Fair Cookbook celebrated regional  differences that The World of Tomorrow sought for the most part  to erase. Futurama and Democracity were completely a-regional  locations. The New York World's Fair Cookbook is one of only a  few indicators that becoming typical Americans did not have to  mean becoming identical Americans.  States' Evidence presents typical menus chosen by home  economists at their respective state universities. The menus  are emphatically regional in choice and combination of  ingredients, as well as in names for dishes. The menu from  South Carolina, composed by Mrs. John Hargrove calls for:  Berkeley County tomato juice Southern fried chicken Charleston rice Cream Gravy Monetta buttered asparagus  Lake City string beans with salt pork Fort Motte artichoke relish Whole wheat biscuit Beaufort lettuce hearts Ambrosia Mother's pound cake Coffee Orangeburg salted pecans (Gaige 1939, 263)   The main course of fried chicken with cream gravy is  notably southern, and the rice typical of the coastal  Carolinas. Lake City string beans may not be different from  other string beans, but the practice of seasoning string beans  with salt pork is regional. The Wisconsin menu includes  \"Cheesets,\" toasted croutons which are midwestern in style and  in makeup. Cut day-old bread into slices two inches thick. Cut  each slice into four cubes. Dredge in melted Wisconsin  Butter, roll in grated Wisconsin hard nippy cheese and  bake in preheated oven (300 F.) until puffy and slightly  browned. (ten to fifteen minutes). Serve with soup,  salad, or at teatime (277). The dishes in the Wisconsin menu promote the state by promoting  consumption of the state's major food products--butter and  cheese.  The attention paid in the New York World's Fair Cookbook to  regional differences was only just becoming fashionable in  American cookbooks in the 1930's (Levenstein 1993, 37-39;  Mendelson 1996, 230). The cookbook was ahead of its time as  well in its acknowledgement of \"Native American Cookery\": The cooks of America ought to raise their best  stirring spoons in salute to this friendly standby, [corn]  our gift from the first Americans. Thank you Oquagas,  Narragansetts, Penobscots, Senecas, Seminoles, Chocktaws,  Algonquins, Iroquois, Shoshones, Navahos, Cherokees and  all the others (ix)! In 1939 the term \"Native American\" was more commonly used to  distinguish longer established European Americans from recent  immigrants than to refer to American Indians.1  When Washday was Sloshday: Re-imagining the Future of  Housework  Ladies, when you're feeling especially sorry for  yourselves, go to FORWARD MARCH AMERICA, the Electric  Light and Power Company's exhibit at the New York World's  Fair. See how your mothers and grandmothers had to keep  house with no more equipment than a crank's stove, broom,  washtub and washboard, plus a sad iron. Then push buttons  in your own house and see how easy your housekeeping is  with Electricity to help you (NYPL box 1435). \"When Washday was Sloshday\" was one of the many vivid  tableaux vivants at the Electric Light and Power Company's  exhibit at the fair. A weary woman wearing layers of rags  scrubbed clothes on an iron washboard. Exhibitors at the fair,  and the numerous women's magazines in which they advertized,  repeatedly and strenuously assured women who work in the home  that their work was easier than household work had been in the  past, and that they themselves were lovelier than their mothers  and grandmothers had been. They had never had it better,  according to American Cookery: New products for the month! First, brewed coffee put  up in cans, all ready to be served hot or cold. Second,  paper tea balls, using perforated paper that is  waterproof. Life gets easier and easier, doesn't it girls  (Ford 1939, 497)? The kitchen of the past was not a nostalgic hearth, but a  domestic chamber of horrors from which all American women  should be thankful to have escaped. Indeed, the complete  absence of any nostalgia for the past distinguishes the World  of Tomorrow (Rydell 115; Cusker 117).2 This section examines  how various exhibits at the fair presented what was wrong with  the American kitchen of the past and how it could be fixed for  the future. Cooking would be quicker, easier, and more  hygienic. Quicker cooking, this argument ran, would free the  American woman to pursue various activities outside the home  even though in 1939 housewives in their electrified kitchens  may well have been busier than ever (Cowan 1983, 99). The Forward March America exhibit was clearly aimed at  women. They were most directly affected by the electrical  revolution in the kitchen, and were probably responsible for  their families' purchases of equipment. The tone of the Forward  March America exhibits was harsh because it was meant to  disabuse young American women of any fond illusions about the  past. The Electrical Light and Power Company was depending on  the women of the future to become educated and enthusiastic  consumers of electrical power. Forward March America drove  home the point that it was especially women they called to  march into forward to the future by pairing their tableau on  kitchen work with one on hairdressing. The Electric Light and  Power Company abjected the fashions of the past as well as the  kitchen technology of the past in a tableau entitled Beauty and  the Least: Not only did ladies burden themselves with hair too  long for comfort and convenience, but said hair had to be  dried slowly with the doubtful help of a palm leaf fan.  Next time you girls glibly order a shampoo and finger  wave, think of the girls who spent all day getting ready  for a date (NYPL box 1435). Westinghouse also made explicit the link between the  futures of feminine spheres of kitchen work and grooming when  they staged \"The Battle of the Centuries,\" a dishwashing  contest between two pretty young women, \"Mrs. Drudge,\" who  washed dishes by hand, and \"Mrs. Modern,\" who used a  Westinghouse dishwasher. The battle was performed every day in  the Westinghouse pavilion, and always pulled a crowd. Mrs.  Drudge, with loose shoulder length hair, raced to wash dishes  over a steaming sink, while Mrs. Modern, with short styled  hair, stood calmly beside her dishwasher. A male narrator gave  rapid, ringside commentary, which, along with Mrs. Drudge's  pratfalls, elicited appreciative laughter from the audience.  At the end, he judged Mrs. Drudge and Mrs. Modern based on  speed, cleanliness of the dishes, and appearance of the  contestants. The disgusted Mrs. Drudge literally threw in her  towel, especially disappointed to have failed in the last  category.  General Electric's egg-frying demonstration starred four  beauties in their bathing suits frying one egg in a bowl  hovering over a magnetic core. All these performances showed  lovely, composed women, dressed for leisure or play,  effortlessly performing the ease that American industry would  bring to housework of the future. A woman who became a consumer  of their products could complete her household duties without  surrendering her female sex-appeal. Popular fiction and  advertising from the early 20th century stress that a homemaker  must be lovely and serene as well as skilled and devoted  (Shapiro 1986, 25). \"Make your kitchen a beauty parlor for  pots and pans\" was the copy of a 1939 magazine advertizement  for SOS soap pads,3 and indeed, industrial exhibitors brought  the glamour, the indulgence, and the leisure of the beauty  parlor into the modern American kitchen, in their exhibits as  well as in their advertizing.   Two models for the kitchen of tomorrow were the Living  Kitchen designed for the America at Home exhibit by Allmon  Fordyce, and the Kitchen of the Electrified Farm. The Living  Kitchen was one of sixteen model interiors meant to display  modernity of design as well as function. Fordyce issued a  release indicating what the kitchen of the future would need to  be: The \"Living Kitchen\" is a room for the whole family to  live in. Fresh in its approach to the new needs of the  modern family, it combines the maximum comfort for daily  living and the greatest efficiency for cooking and  workspace. . . . The chief function of this kitchen is to  lighten the burden of work for the woman who is doing the  cooking and housekeeping in her own home and to provide an  opportunity for her to share the companionship of her  family and friends while she is working. . . . Less than  one per cent of the population employ servants. . . . By  sharing the room with friends, they are not \"slaves\" to  the job (NYPL box 363). By making the Living Kitchen open to the living and dining  rooms of the house, Fordyce assured women that what kitchen  work remained in the newly efficient facility was not dirty or  demeaning or low-class. On the contrary, making the  housewife's kitchen activities visible gave value to her  efficiency and attractiveness, rather than to her labor, so  much so that the kitchen became an extension of the living and  dining rooms--a place of sociability rather than burdensome  work. In her kitchen, the housewife could show herself  performing technology with perfect ease. In the kitchen at the Electrified Farm a woman prepared  food in a very large and well-equipped rural kitchen,  explaining all the steps of her work to spectators standing  outside the house and looking in the windows. A small  microphone around her neck broadcast her voice to the audience  outside, whom she did not \"see\" or acknowledge. The kitchen  exhibit, like the rest of the Electrified farm, used  naturalistic performances to show how modern electrical  equipment would be integrated into everyday life. It showed  how, in fact, Typical Americans would come into contact with  the World of Tomorrow.   The World of Tomorrow promised to change the domestic  space the housewife occupied by making her work easier and more  interesting. The average housewife would become a new kind of  Typical American, Mrs. 1939, whose presence in her kitchen  would be ornamental. Her performance would make her visible in  a way that would distinguish her tasks from those of servants,  who perform their work unseen (Barber 1940b). Time-saving  foods and labor-saving appliances having liberated her from the  drudgery of heavy kitchen work, she could create whimsical  conceits such as the sandwich loaf in the form of the frosted  cake, an emblem of how to consume industrial food, use up  surplus time, and create the visual effect of effort   Notes to part III  1. Gaige's particular interest was spices and herbs, and he  took the opportunity to include at the back of the New York  World's Fair Cookbook a section he called \"The spice shelf  today.\" Under sweet basil, for instance, Gaige wrote, \"A  little known flavor, it well rewards the experimenter.\" and  suggested using it with tomatoes. Andre Simon especially  praised the spice list in his review of the book and called it  a valuable reference (Simon 1939, 283). 2. The Electric Light and Power Company exhibition included  scenes from the bad old days of gaslight New York. While many  historians of the world's fair have noted in retrospect that  the credulous utopian enthusiasm for the future seems quaint,  it is no more quaint than a longing for an imagined past. 3. One place this advertisement appeared was Woman's Day.  April, 1940, 47.    Part IV The Typical American Table: Americanizing  Etiquette   In the World of Tomorrow, not only would architecture  become smooth and ovoid and kitchen equipment streamlined, but  outmoded coarse behavior would also be refined. Factory- prepared foods, modern electric equipment, and a typical  American diet were not to be enough for life in the World of  Tomorrow. Shoddy manners, uninformed by modern American  etiquette, lagged behind the times and also needed futurizing.  Social reformers of the first part of the century regarded the  Americanizing of table manners to be among the most important  adaptations new immigrants needed to make (Levenstein 1988  105).  The America at Home Pavilion opened in 1940, replacing the  focal exhibit of the Community Interests Zone, where Mrs.  Modern had built her house with a telephone. While in other  pavilions at the fair the future of manufacturing and  technology was on display, America at Home showed how that  technology would affect the future of the home, where many of  the new products and inventions exhibited elsewhere at the fair  would ultimately be put into practice. Not only did the  sixteen model interiors show what the inside of the typical  American home of the future might look like, but programs and  performances showed what appropriate behavior for everyday  activities might look like.   The America at Home pavilion was inaugurated with the \"All  American Dinner,\" prepared and served by Miss Edith Barber in  the Living Kitchen. The All American Dinner was followed by a  \"Cooking Quiz\" on the turntable stage which was at the center  of the America at Home pavilion. The menu for the All American  Dinner was:  Dunking Tray (Vegetables and shrimp with horseradish mayonnaise sauce) Fried Chicken Asparagus Hollandaise    Baked Potatoes Little Yeast Rolls Old-Fashioned Strawberry Shortcake Coffee All who attended received a complimentary menu with recipes.  At the \"Cooking Quiz\" after dinner, Miss Barber posed and  answered many \"controversial\" questions about the dinner menu,  among them the following:  Biscuit dough or cake batter for strawberry shortcake?  [The recipe indicated biscuit dough.] Must a man dress for dinner if a woman does? May bread be served at dinner? May coffee be served during the meal? The task of defining the role of the housewife of the  future also makes it necessary to define masculinity in the  World of Tomorrow. Must the husband of tomorrow dress for  dinner? No answer is given in the script, but the performances  at the America at Home pavilion indicate that he must.  Since the end of the nineteenth century, as American  society reacted to the absorption of large waves of immigrants,  women, and young women in particular, had been the targets of  the urban social reformers who sought to Americanize recent  immigrants with the refining influence of etiquette.  Frequently the immigrant communities themselves made the  connection between manners and Americanization (Joselit 1990,  41). Their daughters--and especially new brides--were the  targets of the improving exhibits and performances produced at  America at Home. Women, motivated to educate themselves, their  husbands and their children, were the vectors for new  information. In the fall of 1940, shortly before the fair was  to close, America at Home sponsored Bride's Day. On September  29, 1940, any bride who had married in 1940 and showed a  wedding certificate to prove it was granted free admission to  the fair--husbands still had to pay. Some of the furnishings  from the America at Home exhibit were awarded to brides as  prizes--at the end of the fair, exhibitors needed to dismantle  and dispose of their material. Other prizes were blankets,  scales, radios and cookbooks. As the Chicago Jewish Sentinel  proclaimed in 1935, a good cookbook is as indispensable to a  home as a bed (quoted in Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1990, 88). The highlight of the America at Home exhibit was the \"Live  Dinner Party,\" which was performed on the turntable stage twice  a day for a packed house of two hundred visitors. Helen  Sprackling produced the \"Live Dinner Party\" and acted as the  narrator. Two couples sat at an elegantly appointed table  eating a dinner served by a uniformed maid and conversed  comfortably as they rotated in front of their audience. A  narrator in a full-length evening gown stood off to the side  and called attention to the proper execution of dinner table  protocol. The narrator also pointed out the design of the  party. The tablecloth, the dishes, the maid's uniform, and the  hostess's dress were all blue and white. The woman guest's  dress was white and both the men were in dinner dress.  Sparkling emphasized that the performance could entertain and  edify, as well as reinforce the wife's leading role in matters  of decorum: The auditorium . . . is packed each day at both shows. . .  . The show has elicited some very pointed sighs of relief  from the women, who have been re-assured on certain  troubling points of etiquette (NYPL box 364). The costumes were the same for every performance and so was the  menu. Every meal began with Campbell's soup and every meal  ended with Jell-O, both major exhibitors at the fair. The four  diners at the \"Live Dinner Party\" ate Campbell's soup and  Jell-O twice a day in their tuxedoes whilst spinning around on  a turntable.1 Both the All American Dinner and the Live Dinner Party  presented, in their different ways, a vision for the future of  the American table. At the Live Dinner Party, diners performing  correct manners wore formal dress and ate processed foods,  while at the All American Dinner, diners wearing informal dress  and cooking their own food performed a menu related to  heritage. Both offered up a feminized version of the American  table where men, lagging behind American women in the sprint to  the future, would be refined by codified table manners and  gentler, more feminine foods. Both dinner performances were  finally performances of consumption. Proper deportment and  etiquette elevated the industrially produced food on exhibit at  the fair, and elevated the people who prepared and ate it. Enthusiastic attendance at both these model dinners would  seem to indicate that almost all of the fairgoers who came to  enjoy the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940 were striving to  become more typical. In the fifteen years since America had  severely restricted immigration the country had become more  introspective, and it was essential to American homemakers to  prove themselves as Europe was sliding into war. That hundreds  would pack the house to watch four people eating dinner  testifies to how very urgently, how very passionately,  Americans of 1940 wanted to do the right thing, the typical  thing, if only they knew what it was.    Note to Part IV  1. Another production of Sprackling's, a performance entitled  \"Bringing up Bridget\" about how a young housewife should train  her first maid, was not performed at the fair. Edith Barber's  other book published that year, Speaking of Servants, was not  on sale at America at Home along with the Edith Barber  Cookbook.     V Conclusion: The Future is not What it Used to Be  The flavors of the World of Tomorrow that industrial and  municipal exhibitors of the New York World's Fair of 1939-40  offered up to American consumers were flavors of a safe, clean  future where food, housework, domestic space, and even the  deportment of Americans themselves would be different, modern,  and better. Americans, in their cooking and eating, would  conform to the smooth lines of the fair's futuristic design  even as they conformed to one another in their efforts to  become \"typical.\"  The exhibits that valorized typicality frequently did so by  equating typicality with consumption of manufactured and  uniform goods--consumption of milk, of packaged food, and of  the many electrical appliances that would bring the kitchen up  to typical American standards. Marketing techniques appealed  to patriotism and conflated good citizenship with good  consumerism. Industrial manufacturers planned their exhibits to allow  potential consumers to look inside the manufacturing process  and see that there was nothing therein about which to be  alarmed. The spaces were vast and clean, all vessels were  transparent, and, in many cases, all the labor was carried out  by lovely young women. Food of the future as presented at the  fair would be more packaged, more processed, and more  synthetic. In 1939 many felt this was good news. Processed  and packaged food stood not for tastelessness but for safety  and hygiene. The fair's exhibits urged women in particular to steer the  way for their families in their electrified kitchens--kitchens  in which they would no longer be confined as in the old days,  but to which they would willingly return time and again, to  indulge in recreational cooking in-between their diverting and  self-improving activities. In these open and comfortable  kitchens, women of the future using factory prepared foods  could whip up impressive and decorative creations that  delighted guests and flattered the decorative cook herself. American housewives would also have the pleasure of serving  food to their families in a casually elegant atmosphere.  Uncouth behavior would be as out of place in the World of  Tomorrow as a washboard or crank's stove.  The world of tomorrow would be an America of the future  where automobiles would rule the roads, machinery would make  the lives of American workers safer and easier in the factory  and in the home. Cooking and eating in particular were to be  more streamlined and more hygienic as prepared foods and  futuristic equipment entered the American lifespace. Food  exhibits at the New York World's Fair 1939-1940 invited  visitors to throw off the outmoded prejudices of the past and  feast on the future.

{"detail": [{"content": "Feasting on the Future: Food at the New York World's Fair, 1939-1940  Eve Jochnowitz    Mr Grover Whalen N.Y. World's Fair New York City  Dear Mr. Whalen:-  I just must take the time out and let you know how happy I  am because you selected such a typical American as Kate Smith to  sing at the opening of THE FAIR, and I only wish that finances  would permit my being there. I do not think you could have found a more AMERICAN person  than Kate Smith - after all this is AMERICA the fair emblematic  of what AMERICANS CAN DO, and Kate Smith emphasizes AMERICA in  her song, praise of the country, its products, its art and music  - in fact is she not THE MOST TYPICAL PUBLIC AMERICAN  ENTERTAINER? She has the seriousness that is needed, and I only  wish that we had more \"Kate Smiths\" in America - people who  would talk their country, pat it on the back, as well as our  American made products - from soil to tapestries. It would even  be a good idea if some of our monied people would think that  American Home Furnishings, American investments, American  Scenery, etc. were BETTER than that of Foreign Lands, or makes. I certainly take my hat off to you for your selection, and  also to Kate Smith for her PERSONIFICATION of American Ideals. Much success for a 1940 Fair and I only wish I could be  there for the opening.  Yours for a successful season,  CC to Kate Smith    Mrs. A. Freeland         Rock Island, IL  (New York World's Fair 1939-1940 collection, Rare Books and  Manuscripts Division of the New York Public Library: Box 253.  Emphases and punctuation are in the original.1)   Trylon and Perisphere, the gleaming spire and globe that  became symbols of the New York World's Fair of 1939-40 and  appeared on countless World's Fair souvenirs, served as  constant reminders of the fair's message of optimism, hope for  the future, and valorization of the \"typical American.\"  Perisphere, \"the largest globe ever made by man,\" symbolized  the world we live in (with all its typicality), and Trylon, a  slender three-sided tower 700 feet tall, symbolized our  aspirations for the future.2  The food-related exhibits of the New York World's Fair  pressed the fair's official aim to present an optimistic view  of the future and its unofficial practice of honoring all that  was typically American. I will argue that in the process, the  fair's diverse exhibits created a feminized vision of the  future--a future in which women, in their many roles as food  providers, would shape their families into typical American  consumers and make the country safe for American manufacturers.  This paper will examine the food exhibits at the New York  World's Fair in relation to these themes. Part I explores the  role of food in defining \"future\" and \"typical.\" Part II  examines exhibits of food production--the farm and the factory- -in which futuristic technology would produce more \"typical\"  results. Part III, the heart of the paper, moves into the  kitchen, where the typical and the future meet in the typical  American housewife, the unsung heroine of the whole fair, who  harnesses the technology of the future to do her bidding. Part  IV discusses the exhibits devoted to manners and deportment,  which made the American table a site where Americans of all  kinds could become more typical by correcting their behaviour.  The New York World's Fair Corporation, headed by the  dashing Grover Whelan,3 selected the forward-looking theme of  \"Building the World of Tomorrow\" to be the fair's unifying  narrative, and made the celebration of the 150th anniversary of  George Washington's inauguration the putative occasion of the  fair.  The layout of the fairgrounds, which were located at the  Corona Dumps4 in Flushing Queens, followed the model of the  Great Mall in Washington, D. C. The New York City Hall  Pavilion anchored the west end of the mall, and the Court of  Peace, crowned by the United States Federal Government  Pavilion, was the anchor at the east end. In the center, and  visible from almost anywhere in the 1200 acre fairgrounds,  Trylon and Perisphere rose shimmering over their reflecting  pool. Seven zones, all of which had some food-related  exhibits, were arranged around the themes of government,  community interests, food, communications, medicine, production  and distribution, and amusement. The Federal Government Pavilion was in the Government  Zone5(see map), which included the pavilions of the states and  the foreign countries exhibiting at the fair. Many of the  foreign government pavilions offered as their main attraction  restaurants serving dishes representing their national  cuisines. In the Community Interest Zone, whose centerpiece  was the \"Town of Tomorrow,\" home-related exhibits such as gas,  furnishings, and radio shared space with the Temple of Religion  and the Jewish Palestine Pavilion. Exhibits in the Community  Interest Zone displayed technological and social advances in  kitchen work, kitchen design, and deportment intended to  improve cooking at home and dining at home in the future. Cafe  Tel Aviv, serving \"Palestine type dishes,\" was part of the  Jewish Palestine Pavilion. Immediately to the south stood the  Food Zone, where the pavilions for Borden, Swift, Heinz and  other industrial food exhibitors held their exhibits and  performances. To the west were zones for communication,  medicine, and transportation, and production and distribution,  where exhibits for Con Edison, Westinghouse, U. S. Steel, and  General Electric, among others, showed the wonders that  electrically powered kitchen equipment and modern kitchen  materials would bring to food preparation in the factory and  the home. A large Amusement Zone, with many restaurants of its  own, flanked the fair to the south, but had no place on the  Constitution Mall. A \"focal exhibit\" in each zone related that  particular zone to the World of Tomorrow. The focal exhibits  were designed by the Fair Corporation, while other buildings  were the responsibility private exhibitors. The broad and  didactic focal exhibits were unpopular, and in the second year  of the fair, all the focal exhibits closed and private exhibits  took their place.   A World's Fair is a temporary universe. Feasting on the  Future will examine the stated and unstated aims of the New  York World's Fair of 1939-1940 through the most temporary of  artefacts, food.    Notes 1. Most of the primary material for this paper is from the  correspondence and files of the New York World's Fair, courtesy  of the New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden  Foundations, Rare Books and Manuscripts Division, New York  World's Fair Records 1939-40. Material from the Astor, Lenox  and Tilden collection will hereafter be identified by the  letters NYPL and box number. 2. Trylon and Perisphere were proper names. Contemporaneous  sources were inconsistent, many referring to them as \"the  Trylon\" and \"the Perisphere.\" I have used them as names  throughout. 3. A history of Grover Whelan's peculiar and often disastrous  career as a director of exhibitions is beyond the scope of this  paper, but it is necessary to mention the dashing Mr. Whelan's  extraordinary animal magnetism, which permeates all accounts.  Letters from women and men to the fair, such as the letter I  chose as the epigraph to this paper, were frequently addressed  to Whelan personally, and filled with the warmest sentiments.  Much of the glamour associated with this particular fair was  Whelan's own. 4. Mayor LaGuardia had hoped that the fair would allow the  city to reclaim the Corona Dumps as a public park. Because of  the outbreak of World War II, the city had to postpone plans  for the park until another World's Fair, in the years 1964-65,  revived the area again. 5. I will use the capitalization conventions of the World's  Fair Corporation throughout.     PART I: Typical Americans: Perfection or Abjection?  \"Makes you proud of your country\" was the slogan of Elmer1,  mascot of the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940, and a symbol  of the typical American visitor. The source of pride is the  fair itself. Almost every exhibit and performance at the Fair,  from the pageants led by Mayor LaGuardia and Grover Whelan to  the recipe pamphlets, valorized the \"typical American.\" In the  second year of the fair, when Europe was at war, typical  Americans were themselves on display. Families from each of  the forty-eight states entered contests run by their local  newspapers to select the most typical representatives of each  state. Entrants submitted essays in which they explained why  they were typical, and winners came to live at the fair for one  week in one of the two model homes set up on the fairgrounds.  Each \"typical American family\" was presented with a one-week  lease and keys to their home by Harvey Gibson, the vice- president of the fair. Dad was always handed the lease, Mom,  the keys. Each typical American family posed for photographs  as they moved in, moved out and raised their state flag. Upon  departure, each \"typical American boy\" received a baseball  autographed by Babe Ruth. Each \"typical American girl\" got a  bracelet.  A publicity photo from the fair shows Grover Whalen, the  president of the fair, and Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia greeting  the first two typical American families to arrive at the fair.  Ironically, Mayor LaGuardia could, in his ceremonial capacity,  welcome typical families to the Fair, but his family would  never have qualified as typical. No Italian-American families  won the contest for the typical American family, nor, for that  matter, did any Black or Jewish families. All of the winning  families, two from each of the 48 states, were white and had a  mother, father and two kids. These mobile and arguably  exhibitionist families were families of the future in more ways  than the fair's planners could have known.2  Black, Jewish and Italian Americans, excluded from exhibits  of typicality, appeared on a \"Wall of Fame\" for \"Notable  Americans of Foreign Birth, Negroes and American Indians\"(NYPL  box 252). The notable Americans who made it onto the wall were  sorted by country of origin and field of endeavor. Negroes and  American Indians were included in their own categories, but no  separate category was created for Jews of foreign birth.3  The Wall of Fame committee was navigating troubled waters.  In 1939, with immigration severely restricted and war  approaching, very few were going on record to say anything good  about Americans of foreign birth. By honoring immigrants,  Negroes and American Indians, the Wall of Fame made the case  that the diversity of American achievement was no threat to  American typicality. The Wall of Fame committee tried to  distribute immigrants evenly by country and field, while  representing groups proportionally to their population. They  also had to make do with whatever actual notables they had to  work with. One memo in the Wall of Fame files states  regretfully that many German scientists had to be left out  because there were simply more than enough Germans represented  in the field of science.  Not everyone born in a particular country was considered  representative of that country, whether in their own eyes or in  the eyes of their fellow countrymen. A Mr. Frgosa protested  that there were only five Portuguese honored on the Wall of  Fame, and that all five of them were Jews. His letter, which  the committee forwarded to Father Joseph Carrella of St.  Anthony's Welfare Center, dramatizes the problem of grouping  immigrants by country. Father Carrella distanced himself and  the Portuguese community of New York from the letter writer, a  well known \"trouble maker.\" \"This man,\" wrote Father Carrella,  \"means nothing to the Portuguese. We are satisfied with the  names of the Portuguese Jews,\" he continues, \"because the  Portuguese Jews and the Portuguese were the first settlers in  the city of New York and we are proud of their record\" (NYPL  box 252). Should Jews have had a separate category? Some members of  the Committee for Jewish Palestine felt it was prudent to be  restrained about exhibiting Jewish achievement.4 No doubt  Jewish fairgoers combed through names on the Wall of Fame as  obsessively as did Frgosa to find notable Jews from various  countries. While they would not have found a category set  aside for Jews, they would have found many Jewish names, as  there was apparently no effort to limit their numbers. In  addition to comprising the entire Portuguese delegation to the  wall, Jews, with one exception, made up the entire Polish  delegation as well as most of the pared-down selection of  Germans.  In contrast to the display of typical Americans at the  fair, the Wall of Fame honored well-known individuals, such as  Samuel Goldwyn and Albert Einstein, whose fame and  extraordinary contributions made them remarkable. To win a  place on the Wall of Fame, immigrants had to be outstanding,  and their names familiar. To win the Typical Family Contest,  the families had to be ordinary. Honored Americans thus fell  into the mutually exclusive categories of typical natives and  exceptional immigrants. The exceptional achievements of non- natives were thus located in the past, while typical and  undistinguished families provided models for the future--if not  models in achievement, then models as consumers. However much the fair celebrated the typical American,  internal memos of the food committee show that the fair's  planners did not think the typical American was all that smart.  They planned the food displays accordingly. Larry K. Herzog,  who began organizing the fair's food exhibits in 1937, seems to  have had two main goals in assembling the food exhibitors:  First, to promote American industry in a time of economic  depression, and second to advance the education of \"The  average American,\" a paradigmatic individual for whom he  apparently had no great regard. In a 1937 letter to the editor  of Baker's Weekly, Herzog wrote, \"I am trying so hard to  provide a basis for the food exhibitors to help us in helping  themselves as well to push back the mental horizon of consumer  understanding as related to food\" (NYPL box 150). He  complained that the \"average housewife\" did not know about half  of the baked products available in America, and \"All the  average person thinks about\" is the finished food product  rather than the process of manufacture. Herzog's goals of  education and promotion are inextricably linked to consumption  in all the exhibits that ultimately took shape at the fair.  The average American, enlightened by the fair's educational  exhibits and warmed to American industry would become an ideal  consumer. Beatrice Mabry, director of the educational section of the  food exhibit, sought to put together suitable instruction for  informed consumers of the future. \"Does the average individual  consume approximately a ton of food a year?\" She wrote to Dr.  Louis Stanley of the United States Department of Agriculture on  March 13, 1937, \"if not, what amount? What does the human  stomach hold--a pint, a pint and a half or what\"(NYPL box 150)?  The final result of Mabry's research was a scale model of  Manhattan Island in Russell Wright's focal food exhibit with  skyscrapers and piles of food showing how much food Americans  consumed in a day. The purpose of the model buildings was to  convey the enormity of scale. Herzog and Mabry hoped that such  simple visual metaphors could educate consumers about food  painlessly, but the sight of a pile of food next to a  skyscraper turned out not to be as appealing to the public as  they might have wished.  The same combination of earnest yet wacky didacticism  continued throughout the food pavilion. Exhibits in the focal  food exhibit used surreal visual metaphors to explain the  miracles of futuristic food technology. Wright intended these  vivid and colorful images to make the scientific and industrial  aspects of food manufacture seem warm and wholesome. Display  cases held flying lobsters, an aqueduct squirting roses into  the desert, an alligator pear (avocado) with five jewels, an  eye winking in a cave, a clock running backward inside a tin  can and a cauliflower wearing boxing gloves knocking out a  centipede. No labels accompanied the exhibit. A recorded  voice, when it was working, explained that the flying lobsters  represented the miracle of refrigerated transportation, the  roses stood for modern irrigation, the jewels in the avocado  symbolized such ordinary things and vitamins and fats, the eye  stood for the vitamin cure for night-blindness, the clock in  the can showed how canning made time stand still for fresh food  and of course the cauliflower protected by pesticides defeated  parasitic vermin. Unfortunately, the recorded voice was not  always working, causing one student of display to note wryly  that \"The mystery of those aerial crustaceans was wearing us  down\" (Cummings 1940, 94). The humor in these whimsical  displays made the case to potential consumers that  technological food manufacture was not cold and forbidding, but  friendly and inviting. The fair planners felt strongly that visitors needed  exactly this kind of gentle instruction to make the country  safe for industrial food manufacturers and their internal memos  show that there was a wide gulf between what they wished to  show typical Americans to be and what the fair's planners  thought typical Americans actually were. In spite of drawing  better crowds than any of the other focal exhibits, the focal  food exhibit received mixed reviews and closed in 1940, as did  the other focal exhibits, to make way for the Coca-Cola  pavilion. The focal food exhibit's designers were not alone in their  urgent desire to improve the unschooled eating practices of  average Americans. Not only America's scientists, but also the  clergy felt that uninformed eating was a threat not only to  health, but to morality, religion, and the nation's future. In  \"Man's future depends on what he decides to eat,\" Scientific  Monthly concluded that \"Not enough of us are making the three- times-a-day decision as wisely as might be\" (\"Man's future  depends\" 1938, 374).  \"The churches are in the midst of an all but losing fight  with the restaurants for the souls of men.\" was the alarmed  cry of the Zion Herald: Organ of American Methodism, which  argued that a startling number of souls had been \"damned by bad  food\" (\"Food and Religion\" 1939, 38). The hurried thoughtless  eating so typical in America was to the Herald very much a  moral issue as well as a health issue. The Organ of American  Methodism would not have used the word \"damned\" lightly. The  same urgency felt by their contemporaries the Italian futurists  informs the argument of the scientists and the clergy.5  Food corporations that exhibited at the fair took up the  fight for better informed eating in the recipe booklets that  were distributed free at their pavilions at the fair. The  Sealtest recipe pamphlet for the World's Fair includes a short  essay by Professor R. B. Stoltz of Ohio State University that  manages to address concerns about health and morality in its  promotion of milk as a beverage for adults: The typical American, when handed a menu to designate  his choice of beverages, usually replies, \"I'll take  milk.\" This is true for all seasons of the year. The 130  million people, who live in the United States, do not  realize how milk conscious we are. Almost unknowingly we  appreciate the food value of milk and its effect upon our  physical, mental and moral acts. . . .  In most foreign countries milk is not considered a  beverage for the adults. Neither do those adults usually  have the pep, initiative and enthusiasm that can be found  in a group of typical Americans (Sealtest Inc. 1939, 11).  A \"Professor,\" a scientific spokesperson for the future,  not an old-fashioned chef or a farmer, endorses milk. His  arguments in favor of milk are very much in line with the  fair's elevation of typical Americans. Because typical  Americans do drink milk, Americans should drink milk. The  descriptive is prescriptive. Furthermore, foreigners drink  less milk than Americans and they are the worse for it  physically, mentally, and morally. Sealtest was correct in  predicting that with war imminent, their customers would want  to approximate the typical American and not the unspecified,  lackluster foreigner.  Elmer and Mrs. Modern: Two views for the Future  Elmer the typical American is a particularly rich, if  conflicted, symbol. Elmer is a middle-aged white male. He  wears a striped three-piece suit with a watch chain in his vest  pocket. His ample build, slightly unfashionable suit and hat,  and unflagging joviality point to the out-of-town origins of  this small town businessman at this New York fair. \"Elmer-- Jolly, average, everyday American--is being immortalized in  countless posters this year sounding the keynote of informality  and country fair spirit of the World's Fair of 1940\" (NYPL box  1496). Elmer is meant to be a typical visitor to the fair, not  the typical New Yorker. He is photographed greeting  celebrities, eating hot dogs and baking strawberry shortcake,  but he usually poses with thumbs in vest sleeves--An American  mudra for prosperity and contentment. Elmer was hugely  popular, still, no one would want to be like Elmer, whom the  Sayre, Pennsylvania Evening Times described in one editorial  as \"Plump, moist and a bit of a chump\" (\"We are not a nation of  Elmers\" 1940, n.p.). The editorial states that Americans are  not \"gullible\" like Elmer. The editors clearly read Elmer's  signifiers of typicality as signifiers of gullibility.  A river of difference flowed between New York, host city to  the fair, and the rest of the country, whence the typical  Americans displayed at the fair came. The fair chose to locate  Americanness outside of the big city in an attempt to appeal to  the whole country. While official literature at the fair  ignored the tension, outside sources documented it gleefully.  The cartoons in Trylongs and Perisites (O'Leahy 1939) suggest  how many New Yorkers must have viewed the swarms of out-of-town  visitors descending on the city to visit the fair. Out-of-  towners in the cartoons have long, pointed beaks that look like  Trylon, and spherical heads that look like Perisphere, the  symbols of the fair. Trylongs and Perisites lampoons out-of- town guests and the discomforts of keeping them. A couple eat  their breakfast in the nude as an indignant \"Perisite\" stalks  out the door, her provincial prudery used against her, in \"How  to get rid of a maiden aunt,\" and a graveyard filled with  stones shaped like Trylon and Perisphere contains one with the  inscription: \"Friends And Relations With Me Would Stay/ To Hail  The Dawn of A New Day./ I Had to Steal And Beg And Borrow/ Now  I'm In The World of Tomorrow (O'Leahy 1939, n.p.). The editors  of the Evening News were not wrong to guess that in spite of  the enthusiastic language welcoming visitors and stressing the  virtues of all-American small-town typicality, the fair's  planners and New Yorkers themselves might have held typical  Americans in some disdain. Elmer, the typical American, is clearly marked as an  American of the past. There is no one poster persona analogous  to Elmer for the American of the future, but all the prototypes  for future Americans performed at the fair were gendered  female. In 1939, the Community Interest focal exhibit sought to  show the interdependence of all modern Americans. \"Mrs.  Modern,\" an animated figure, made telephone calls to order all  the elements of her house, down to the ingredients for dinner.  The act of building the physical house itself, surely a  masculine task in the American imagination, became an act of  female consumption. The wife became the complete \"homemaker\"  right down to the physical construction of the house. Harvey  Gibson acknowledges the supremacy of the female homemaker when  he hands the lease of the fair's model home to the Typical  American Husband, but hands the keys to the Typical American  Wife. The fair's food and home-related exhibits called upon  the woman, as the head of consumer choices in her home, to lead  homesteading on the next frontier, the technological age.   In 1939, the future could not come soon enough. The  period between the world wars was a time of great anxiety about  the future of the food supply. Even before the Depression, in  the prosperous decade of the twenties, the country was seized  by fears that either the world was running out of food, or that  average Americans simply would not eat what was good for them  (Levenstein 1988, 176). The food exhibits at the New York  World's Fair of 1939-1940 reassured fairgoers that in the  World of Tomorrow, thanks to the chemist's flask and the  housewife's telephone, there would be plenty of food to go  around and it would be readily available. Educational exhibits  showed Americans how to partake of the food of the future. The  technology of tomorrow would make the drudgery of cooking and  housework obsolete. The average middle-class housewife, who  could no longer depend on servants as she had in the previous  century would now have \"mechanical servants\" to do her  bidding (Rydell 1993, 124). Fairgoers would learn how to  remake themselves even as they remade America for the future  particularly through food, cooking, and eating.    Notes to Part I 1. Leslie Oestereicher, a heavy-set man in his mid-forties,  posed for most of the Elmer images.  2. Robert Rydell identifies this and other world's fair  exhibits with an ominous eugenicist agenda on the part of the  exhibition committees (Rydell 1993, 38-60 and passim). Rydell  is correct that racism played a role in the decisions of the  selection committee, but he misses the point that the typical  American families are a self-selected group whose desire to be  typical was their own.   3. While this is not a paper about the display of Jews in  particular at the world's fair, it is useful to examine the  display issues concerning Jews because of the anomalous  category they form. 4. Dr S. Margoshes wrote of those who were uncomfortable with  these exhibits, \"Still others wondered whether a Jewish exhibit  showing the colossal Jewish contributions to America would not  have the effect of arousing more \"rishus\" by affording an  opportunity to our enemies to renew their contention that the  Jews were in control of the U. S.\" (NYPL box 211).  5. Discourse at the New York World's Fair and in the  contemporary American press on the future of food and eating in  America might provide a worthwhile mirror for Filippo  Marinetti's Futurist Cookbook:  The Futurist culinary revolution has the lofty, noble  and universally expedient aim of changing radically the  eating habits of our race, strengthening it, dynamizing it  and spiritualizing it with brand new food combinations. .  . Until now men have fed themselves like ants, rats, cats  or oxen. . . . It is not by chance that this work is  published during a world economic crisis, which has  clearly inspired a dangerous and depressing panic. . . .  We propose as an antidote to this panic a Futurist way of  cooking, that is: optimism at the table (Marinetti 1932,  21). Often treated as a joke and its more outrageous recipes quoted  out of context, The Futurist Cookbook touches on concerns that  made many Americans in the 1930's uneasy about food and eating.  Marinetti's image of men feeding themselves like rats or oxen  is not so different from the disdain of the New York World's  Fair's planning committees toward the average American when it  came to food.     Part II The Future of Farm and Factory  At previous American expositions the privileged site for  any food display was the farm. The World Colombian Exposition  of 1893 in Chicago featured a Corn Palace, a knight made of  prunes, and an elephant made entirely of walnuts (Longone  1994). By 1939, ingenious displays of abundant produce were  displaced by dazzling displays farm technology. The focal  exhibit on food displayed the benefits of modern irrigation and  pesticides (represented by a cauliflower wearing boxing  gloves). The Electrified Farm exhibit demonstrated modern  farming equipment and techniques. The Electric Light and Power  Company's \"Olde Dairy Farm\" exhibit, showed women in hoop  skirts hand-milking cows and toting heavy milk-pails. Such  displays demonstrated the kind of farm work that was not to be  part of the World of Tomorrow, and provided a contrast to the  effortless work of the future. Exhibits of working women set  up the same dichotomy between kitchen work of the past and  future, as I will show in the next section.   Fresh From the Factory   The farm, however, was merely a footnote. The food of  tomorrow was to come from the American factory. The New York  Times predicted in 1938 that an entirely synthetic food supply  might soon make the laboratory the primary source of American  food (\"An entirely synthetic supply\" 1938, 16). \"Will the  Chemist's Flask do the Work of 1000 Farms?\" asked a display  that showed an agricultural landscape inside a flask. To ask  the question was to answer it. The optimistic response this  question elicited from the fairgoer was yes. In 1939, the idea  that all the food of the future might be synthetic was good  news. Most prognostications about the future of food in the  1930s were grim alarms about an approaching famine and  possibility of widespread starvation because of uncontrollable  population growth. In truth, in the 1930s millions of people in  the United States were severely undernourished with no clear  relief in sight (Levenstein 1993, 4). Exhibiting mass- production of factory food suited the fair perfectly. The mass  production of food in model factories would not only save  America from hunger, but would also do so while mirroring the  streamlined aesthetics of Futurama and Democracity. National  brands such as Wonder Bread produced consistency that made it  possible for Americans to eat identical, and typically  American, food everywhere. Industrialized food streamlined  regional and ethnic differences.  The love affair between the fair and industrial food  manufacturers began in the very earliest stages of planning,  when Larry Herzog wrote to the Chicago Board of Trade: I am particularly interested in getting across to the  ultimate consumer visitor the real story behind the static  packaged foods on the shelves at the grocer's store.  People have no conception of these things; all the average  person thinks about is the farm at one end and the  grocery store at the other, but the amount of capital,  investment, brain, brawn, courage and gamble that lies  between these two terminal points is to them a closed  book (NYPL box 149). Almost every food exhibit made the process of food manufacture  transparent, and emphasized the realness of the process  displayed. Just as the \"real skeleton\" in the Hall of Man drew  visitors, and actual fetuses were on display,1 the look  through, the look inside, the almost illicit glimpse behind the  scenes was an irresistible draw for amusement seekers in 1939- 1940. The Hall of Medicine provided a look inside virtual  human bodies, and the industrial food exhibits took visitors  inside virtual factories to see the hidden processes of  commercial food manufacture. Fairgoers loved to see what was  usually unseen, the fair's planners felt that average Americans  did not know enough about their food to be informed consumers,  and the manufacturers may have felt that fairgoers knew too  much. Industrial food manufacturers needed particularly to  exhibit themselves on their own terms to dispel consumer  uneasiness about the unknown, and to allay consumer concerns  about abuse and neglect in industrial food manufacture.  Every industrial food exhibit, whether it employed performance,  cinema, dioramas, or all three, strove above all to build  confidence among potential consumers by emphasizing the  cleanliness and safety of food manufacture. Many food  corporations felt that the official focal exhibit of the fair  did not dwell sufficiently on the processing stage in food.  Food Industries magazine referred ominously to unspecified  \"best sellers\" that had dragged food manufacturers through the  mud in print (Miller 1939, 59). The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair,  first published in 1906 and very well known in 1939, was one of  the first and most famous efforts by muckraking journalists to  reveal the inner workings of food manufacture. The best answer  to these \"best sellers,\" Miller claimed, was full disclosure of  \"how it's made\" and \"how it's done.\" Food manufacturers  needed to reveal their own inner workings and to do so on their  own terms. If only consumers could visit their factories,  they would see how sanitary and responsible they were. Model  factories at the fair allowed all who entered to see the  hygienic, even sterile, conditions in which workers processed  and packaged their products.  Beautiful young women dressed in spotless white, like  nurses or laboratory technicians, at many of the fair's food  pavilions dramatized the cleanliness and wholesomeness of the  products they presented. Swift, the meat-packing company that  had been Sinclair's primary target, peopled its plant at the  fair with young women in white lab coats who demonstrated the  wrapping of bacon and other Swift products.  These brides of science inspired confidence in the  manufacturing process by showing that food handling work was  light enough, clean enough and safe enough for women to do.  These immaculately dressed young women could hardly be  committing the wretched acts of abuse, neglect, and brutality  that Sinclair and others had exposed early in the century. By  staffing their model factories with women, the industrial food  manufacturers, like the fair's focal exhibits, feminized the  future. Just as the typical American wife, as the perfect  consumer, could build the home of tomorrow using only her  telephone, typical young women became the handmaidens of  industry once technology had shifted \"manpower\" away from the  male body and onto the machine. Even the streamlined forms of  the future were rounded and soft.  Rotating Cows and Little Bakers: Performances Produced for  the Fair  Food exhibitors at the fair had to create a show worth  seeing out of subject matter that was frequently of little  \"visual interest\" (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1991, 386). The  Borden company put cows on the \"Rotolactor,\" a merry-go-round  on which the cows stood while modern machines did the milking.  Cows standing in their stalls for milking may or may not have  drawn spectators, but the Rotolactor, even though it was the  butt of endless jokes, was a huge success. Five million  visitors came to the focal food exhibit, but almost eight  million \"stopped and ah'ed\" at the Borden Rotolactor (Miller  1940, 48). The Rotolactor was \"a ten-strike . . . designed not  to assist in the milking, but to allow a great number of people  to watch the process all at once. Watch they surely did . . .  and then not a few marched across the aisle to the salesroom to  take part in the drinking\" (Cummings 1940, 83). Food  Industries magazine cited the Borden exhibit as the best  example of the need for performance in a world's fair exhibit.  \"Almost every foot of Borden's 80,000 sq. ft. exhibit was a  show. . . . If any manufacturer failed to obtain ample returns  for the investment the blame can only be placed on his act.  He did not put on a good show\" (Miller 1940, 48). Borden also provided an ice cream factory show,  demonstrations of milk being pasteurized, irradiated and  bottled, and a pen of twenty calves, \"replaced every three  weeks to insure their being of a cute age\" (\"Food  Manufacturers' Exhibits\" 1939, 255). To guide visitors, Borden  hired \"15 girl college graduates, selected from more than 100  candidates as information girls for the Borden Company's Dairy  World of Tomorrow\" (NYPL box 149). The information girls were  graduates of Barnard, Smith, Radcliffe, Hunter and Brooklyn  College who were trained to answer \"all predictable questions  from visitors to the Borden Building.\"2 Borden was especially  proud to have among its info girls the triplets Frances,  Marguerite and Catherine Kirshner.3 In 1940 Borden added to the  above an exhibit called \"Elsie in her boudoir,\" an actual cow  standing in a bed shaped stall in a room decorated as a young  woman's bedroom. The youth, freshness and cuteness of the  calves and the information girls (although there is no mention  of how often they had to be replaced) reinforced the message  that milk is a fresh and healthful food. They were also part  of the show. The use of lovely young women by Borden, Swift  and other food companies exhibiting at the fair was not just  the same ordinary sexual exploitation indulged in at Aquacade  and other amusement zone displays at the fair, but a vision of  the feminine form of the future.  The George Washington Coffee Refining Company had \"comely  college girls demonstrating its product\" (\"Food manufacturer's  exhibits\" 1939,44). The Junket Folks boasted that their  desserts were served by attractively attired attendants.  Pretty \"info girls\" guided visitors through Borden's Dairy  World of Tomorrow. Food Industries magazine stated with  approval that pretty girls added \"drama and action\" to the  show. In its bid to attract visitors, the Loose-Wiles Sunshine  Baking company produced a musical vaudeville show for a company  of diminutive bakers. Beech-Nut made a toy circus and circus  parade the main part of its exhibit, which also included  factory demonstrations. The Heinz company, which introduced  the familiar pickle pin at the World's Colombian Exposition in  1893, had a musical revue starring a line of precision dancers  and Mr. Tomato Head, a top-hatted robot. \"Pep up with  Doughnuts\" was the theme of the well-attended demonstrations of  the Doughnut Company of America. After live performances,  color motion pictures drew the most viewers. Nabisco, Coca- Cola, and Planter's all showed movie cartoons for children  about their products. Both Coca-Cola's and Nabisco's movies  starred Mickey Mouse.  Exhibitors also used the fragrance of fresh food to draw  the curious and the hungry. Standard Brands attracted visitors  to the coffee exhibit with the aroma of coffee freshly roasted  at the roasting demonstration. Many fairgoers waited around to  buy the fragrant apple pies they had just seen assembled and  baked at Mrs. Wagner's baking company. Scent was also used by  some of the non-food exhibitors, with varying results. An  orange blossom scent filled the entire Florida pavilion. The  Coty pavilion, and for some reason the Federal pavilion, both  perfumed the air at their exhibits, making them quite  disgusting.4  Futuristic Precision: The Lost Matzo Performance of the  Fair  While matzo might not seem an exemplar of the food of the  future, the Department of Industrial Exhibits attempted,  without success, to bring a matzo baking performance to the New  York World's Fair. In April 1938, Edward Carlin of the  Department of Industrial Exhibits sent an enthusiastic letter  to Frederick Margareten at Horowitz Brothers and Margareten  with his proposal: I think that perhaps a model of your bakery, showing  the process by which your various products are made,  under the most sanitary and painstaking conditions  [emphasis in the original] with regard to both public  health and taste would make a most interesting exhibit. Carlin does not specifically mention matzo, but matzo is  the product that Horowitz baked. \"Sanitary and painstaking\"  were code words for kosher in this context. A working matzo  bakery on the fairgrounds would certainly have provided both  the educational value and the fast action the fair organizers  desired. Carlin also indicates that he was interested in  exhibiting Kashrut, a part of Jewish law that would be in  keeping with the values of the World of Tomorrow, including  cleanliness, speed, and precision. While not values most  fairgoers might associate with Jews, they were important to  consumers of the future, Jewish and non-Jewish alike. Carlin  urged Margareten to consider that \"every one of the fifty- million visitors [to the fair] is a potential buyer of your  products.\"  Horowitz Brothers and Margareten expressed only lukewarm  interest, and there is no record of matzo being present at the  fair in any form. Carlin did get his working bakery, though,  from the Continental Baking Company, which produced Wonder  Bread. Every detail of the baking process was displayed, down  to the growing and harvest of the wheat from a wheat field on  the fairgrounds. Continental's promotional material proudly  emphasized that this was New York City's first wheat field in  sixty-eight years. Just as wheat for matzo must be guarded  from the time it ripens on the stalk, the wheat for Wonder  Bread was never out of public sight. Continental encouraged  fairgoers to come back to the fair and look at the wheat during  different stages of the growing season. Penelope Shoo, the  bosomy \"scarecrow of tomorrow\" wearing a Hattie Carnegie gown,  guarded the Wonder Bread wheat field and gave it a touch of  pizzazz. You can spend as little as 20 minutes or as long as an  hour in watching the automatic process of baking bread  but, in passing through the bakery there is one thought to  keep in mind. Each single action you see, manual or  mechanical, must be timed exactly so that every loaf of  Wonder Bread will go through its 10 1/2 hour career  steadily and without interruption (NYPL box 150). The ten and a half hours required to make Wonder Bread may  not be the eighteen minutes needed to make matzo but the  exactness is what they have in common.  A Gigantic Public Service: Selling the Future of Food  The combined efforts of the food focal and . . . food  companies should convince visitors that food industries  are performing a gigantic public service, that food  processing is a highly technological and efficient  business and that people should pay some attention to  nutritional value in food products (\"Food at the World's  Fair\" 1939, 225). At the New York World's Fair, industrial food exhibitors made  their case for the future to the public.5 In the World of  Tomorrow, foods prepared in the factory would be safer, for a  public concerned about sanitation, and more plentiful and  reliable, for a public concerned with want (\"Death Cannot  Poison Food Inspected, Sterilized and Packaged\" was the  reassuring message of an exhibit about federal inspection).  Uninformed average Americans, for whom the displays were  designed, would come away from the fair with a new  understanding of the value of industrial food processing,  while mass produced and processed food would make the basis for  a new American cuisine in which all typical Americans could  partake.     Notes to Part II  1. Fetuses occupied a very different social space in 1939. A  contemporary critic said of this exhibit that \"If a flag is  good, an embryo or two would be sure fire for a big hand\"  (Cummings 1940, 24).  2. The description of the information girls, with its  emphasis on their being a very select group of recent college  graduates is almost identical to descriptions of the tour  guides at the United Nations (Tatomirovic 1985) and the famous  Harvey Girls. The fair was not alone in employing the  irresistible combination of tourism, food and beautiful women.  For more on the touristic use of uniformed lovelies, see  Tatomirovich 1985, Jochnowitz 1997, and Haber 1997.  3. The Kirshner Triplets, along with all visitors to the  Borden who chose to volunteer, were fingerprinted by the New  York City Police Department. Assured that their fingerprints  would be filed separately from those of criminals, many agreed  to try out the new experience of fingerprinting. Borden's  visitors were at once consumers of spectacle and objects of  surveillance.  4. Professor Michael Coe, personal correspondence. 5. The committee for industrial exhibits chose not to include  proposed exhibits which did not further their agenda of linking  factory produced food and the future. George Kern of Iowa did  not receive space to display his \"World Famous Petrified Ham.\"     Part III Freedom for Mrs. 1939: Cooking in the  Kitchen of Tomorrow   The World of Tomorrow will seem less utopian and more  practical to the women than perhaps it does to the men.  It fits into the dreams and wishful thinking in which  women, particularly mothers of families, have indulged for  more than a generation. . . . The fair hopes to prove it  isn't enough to install a mechanical refrigerator in one's  home. It will show how to get the best use out of that  refrigerator for cheaper, better, food and a happier and  more leisurely family life. It will even suggest cultural  and recreational programs for the employment of the  leisure time (NYPL box 209).  Exhibits that portrayed the future of the American home  situated the typical American housewife right in the World of  Tomorrow. Like previous American fairs, the 1939 New York  World's Fair had planned to set aside a Women's Pavilion. A  committee headed by Mrs. Vincent Astor took on the job of  sifting through the diverse submissions for such a pavilion.  Ultimately the committee on Women's Exhibits decided it was  better not to segregate women in their own pavilion, partly  because any such pavilion would necessarily emphasize  achievements of the past and not the contribution of women to  the World of Tomorrow. As it happened, women were more visible  at this fair, and more active behind the scenes, than at any  previous American fair, and certainly more so than at the  subsequent 1964 World's Fair in New York. Robert Moses, who  presided over the 1964 exposition, was harshly critical of  Grover Whalen's attention to women's issues in the planning of  the 1939 fair. A contemporary remembers Moses complaining that  Whelan always had \"a bunch of cuties around him and how one  would say, 'Grover, we ought to have a dress shop' and there'd  be a dress shop at the fair. Moses said something about how he  didn't want 'no goddamn babes around me'\" (Caro 1974, 815). It  is worth noting that the New York World's Fair of 1939 may have  been the only American Exposition that did have a men's  building. Man, His Clothes, His Parts was a pavilion devoted  to men's fashion and leisure, subjects that previously had been  set aside for women only. The new American woman would require  a new kind of American man.  Fairgoers could consider some of the possible roles for  this new American woman in an exhibit entitled \"Factory  Preparation Frees Mrs. 1939,\" which introduced the focal food  exhibit. The exhibit showed a well-dressed young woman  surrounded by tiny icons representing sports equipment, playing  cards, programs from concerts and a charity bazaar, a  psychoanalysis text and a ballot. The focal food exhibit echoed  the assertion of the industrial exhibits that the homemaker of  tomorrow would be an energetic and sophisticated young woman  who played sports, attended concerts, and did good works. She  would show psychological insight and civic responsibility. She  would not be an overworked unattractive drudge. Factory  preparation of food, by freeing women from drudgery, could  benefit all of society. The gradual elimination of home  cooking was to be good news for the American wife, for the  American family, and for the country itself  The Potato People Have a Job to Do: Recipes Descriptive  and Prescriptive   The general housewife does not know how to prepare and  cook mushrooms properly. With the large amount of  mushrooms now being grown, it is essential that the  housewife be educated as to how to prepare them and serve  them and with this in mind, the mushroom people  contemplate cooking and roasting their product [at the  fair] before the public. The artichoke people in California know they must  educate the general public to use artichokes. The avocado people are in the same boat and, strange  as it may seem, the potato people have a job to do.  --Letter from Joseph Sicker to B. S. Pickett of the  American Pomological Society. Feb. 28 1940 ( NYPL box 148) None of the shiny new equipment of the future, none of the  safe hygienic packaged foods displayed by manufacturers, none  of the American produce shown at the fair would do the American  family much good if no one knew how to use them, the  prerequisite to buying them. The director of fruit and  vegetable exhibits, who came on board in 1940, complained that  typical Americans, personified again as the \"general  housewife,\" do not even know how to cook a potato, let alone  such exotic produce as artichokes and avocados.  Industrial exhibitors' lively cooking demonstrations and  colorful promotional recipe pamphlets included both corporate  iconography and images from the fair in their design. Recipes  in the pamphlets fulfilled their stated aim of instructing  typical American cooks in the use of their products and their  underlying mission to increase consumption of those products.  The presence of recipes greatly increased the chances that  visitors would keep the pamphlets. In these recipes, prepared  products, such as dressings and spice combinations, stand in  for raw ingredients. They challenge the cook to show her  ingenuity in using prepared foods rather than her skill in  cooking from scratch.  In the Durkee Famous Foods Recipes for a Century of  Progress booklet, the \"sandwich loaf\" is dressed up as a  frosted layer cake. I quote this recipe in its entirety to  convey the full force of its genius and ghastliness.  Sandwich Loaf Remove crust from loaf of sandwich bread and slice  legnthwise into four layers. spread slices of bread with  Troco or Dinner Bell Margarine, then spread with desired  fillings. Here are some suggestions: RED FILLING . . . Ham finely ground, mixed with  chopped pimiento and Durkee's mayonnaise. Salmon may be  used instead of ham. YELLOW FILLING: Yolks of hard-boiled eggs, grated and  mixed with Durkee's Mayonnaise. GREEN FILLING: Sweet pickles, watercress or parsley,  olives and nuts, chopped and mixed with Durkee's  mayonnaise. WHITE FILLING: Cream cheese, grated cucumber mixed  with Durkee's mayonnaise. Tuna fish or chicken may also  be used. Put the layers together then wrap loaf tightly in damp  cloth or wax paper and chill thoroughly in refrigerator.  When ready to serve, cover the loaf with the following  mixture: Two packages of cream cheese softened with 8 oz. jar  of Durkee's Salad Aid and one teaspoon Durkee's  Worcestershire Sauce. Spread on outside of loaf as you  would ice a cake. Garnish with slices of stuffed olives,  tomatoes, lemon and sprays of parsley. Cut loaf into  slices 3/4 inch thick and serve. If desired, two kinds of bread may be used,  alternating white and whole wheat (DFF Inc. 1933).  This is a recipe for a special occasion. While the  ingredients--white bread, margarine, mayonnaise and cream  cheese--may themselves be unremarkable, the \"layer cake\" is.  What a cook performs when she prepares this sandwich loaf or  any of the many cleverly disguised recipes of this type is not  technical skill at cooking--that is merely a mechanical skill  better done by machines. Rather, she is performing creativity  and playfulness, now that she is liberated from the drudgery of  making fresh mayonnaise. The resulting sandwich-cake would be  pretty. It would also be a sodden, greasy mess. The recipe is  brilliant in its masquerade as a cake, but inconcerned with the  flavor or texture of the dish.  Similarly, the Sealtest company offered new ideas for that  familiar standby, macaroni and cheese. The Macaroni Croquettes  recipe instructed the cook to form the cooked macaroni and  cheese into balls, roll in beaten eggs and dry crumbs, and  deep-fry. Futuristic macaroni would not be served in a  shapeless pile on a plate, but in a smooth seamless space-age  sphere that recalled the architecture of the Sealtest pavilion  and Perisphere itself.  The World's Fair also authorized a cookbook of its own,  the New York World's Fair Cook Book by Crosby Gaige. The book  sweeps over the country twice, once by region and once again by  state. \"The New York World's Fair Cookbook celebrated regional  differences that The World of Tomorrow sought for the most part  to erase. Futurama and Democracity were completely a-regional  locations. The New York World's Fair Cookbook is one of only a  few indicators that becoming typical Americans did not have to  mean becoming identical Americans.  States' Evidence presents typical menus chosen by home  economists at their respective state universities. The menus  are emphatically regional in choice and combination of  ingredients, as well as in names for dishes. The menu from  South Carolina, composed by Mrs. John Hargrove calls for:  Berkeley County tomato juice Southern fried chicken Charleston rice Cream Gravy Monetta buttered asparagus  Lake City string beans with salt pork Fort Motte artichoke relish Whole wheat biscuit Beaufort lettuce hearts Ambrosia Mother's pound cake Coffee Orangeburg salted pecans (Gaige 1939, 263)   The main course of fried chicken with cream gravy is  notably southern, and the rice typical of the coastal  Carolinas. Lake City string beans may not be different from  other string beans, but the practice of seasoning string beans  with salt pork is regional. The Wisconsin menu includes  \"Cheesets,\" toasted croutons which are midwestern in style and  in makeup. Cut day-old bread into slices two inches thick. Cut  each slice into four cubes. Dredge in melted Wisconsin  Butter, roll in grated Wisconsin hard nippy cheese and  bake in preheated oven (300 F.) until puffy and slightly  browned. (ten to fifteen minutes). Serve with soup,  salad, or at teatime (277). The dishes in the Wisconsin menu promote the state by promoting  consumption of the state's major food products--butter and  cheese.  The attention paid in the New York World's Fair Cookbook to  regional differences was only just becoming fashionable in  American cookbooks in the 1930's (Levenstein 1993, 37-39;  Mendelson 1996, 230). The cookbook was ahead of its time as  well in its acknowledgement of \"Native American Cookery\": The cooks of America ought to raise their best  stirring spoons in salute to this friendly standby, [corn]  our gift from the first Americans. Thank you Oquagas,  Narragansetts, Penobscots, Senecas, Seminoles, Chocktaws,  Algonquins, Iroquois, Shoshones, Navahos, Cherokees and  all the others (ix)! In 1939 the term \"Native American\" was more commonly used to  distinguish longer established European Americans from recent  immigrants than to refer to American Indians.1  When Washday was Sloshday: Re-imagining the Future of  Housework  Ladies, when you're feeling especially sorry for  yourselves, go to FORWARD MARCH AMERICA, the Electric  Light and Power Company's exhibit at the New York World's  Fair. See how your mothers and grandmothers had to keep  house with no more equipment than a crank's stove, broom,  washtub and washboard, plus a sad iron. Then push buttons  in your own house and see how easy your housekeeping is  with Electricity to help you (NYPL box 1435). \"When Washday was Sloshday\" was one of the many vivid  tableaux vivants at the Electric Light and Power Company's  exhibit at the fair. A weary woman wearing layers of rags  scrubbed clothes on an iron washboard. Exhibitors at the fair,  and the numerous women's magazines in which they advertized,  repeatedly and strenuously assured women who work in the home  that their work was easier than household work had been in the  past, and that they themselves were lovelier than their mothers  and grandmothers had been. They had never had it better,  according to American Cookery: New products for the month! First, brewed coffee put  up in cans, all ready to be served hot or cold. Second,  paper tea balls, using perforated paper that is  waterproof. Life gets easier and easier, doesn't it girls  (Ford 1939, 497)? The kitchen of the past was not a nostalgic hearth, but a  domestic chamber of horrors from which all American women  should be thankful to have escaped. Indeed, the complete  absence of any nostalgia for the past distinguishes the World  of Tomorrow (Rydell 115; Cusker 117).2 This section examines  how various exhibits at the fair presented what was wrong with  the American kitchen of the past and how it could be fixed for  the future. Cooking would be quicker, easier, and more  hygienic. Quicker cooking, this argument ran, would free the  American woman to pursue various activities outside the home  even though in 1939 housewives in their electrified kitchens  may well have been busier than ever (Cowan 1983, 99). The Forward March America exhibit was clearly aimed at  women. They were most directly affected by the electrical  revolution in the kitchen, and were probably responsible for  their families' purchases of equipment. The tone of the Forward  March America exhibits was harsh because it was meant to  disabuse young American women of any fond illusions about the  past. The Electrical Light and Power Company was depending on  the women of the future to become educated and enthusiastic  consumers of electrical power. Forward March America drove  home the point that it was especially women they called to  march into forward to the future by pairing their tableau on  kitchen work with one on hairdressing. The Electric Light and  Power Company abjected the fashions of the past as well as the  kitchen technology of the past in a tableau entitled Beauty and  the Least: Not only did ladies burden themselves with hair too  long for comfort and convenience, but said hair had to be  dried slowly with the doubtful help of a palm leaf fan.  Next time you girls glibly order a shampoo and finger  wave, think of the girls who spent all day getting ready  for a date (NYPL box 1435). Westinghouse also made explicit the link between the  futures of feminine spheres of kitchen work and grooming when  they staged \"The Battle of the Centuries,\" a dishwashing  contest between two pretty young women, \"Mrs. Drudge,\" who  washed dishes by hand, and \"Mrs. Modern,\" who used a  Westinghouse dishwasher. The battle was performed every day in  the Westinghouse pavilion, and always pulled a crowd. Mrs.  Drudge, with loose shoulder length hair, raced to wash dishes  over a steaming sink, while Mrs. Modern, with short styled  hair, stood calmly beside her dishwasher. A male narrator gave  rapid, ringside commentary, which, along with Mrs. Drudge's  pratfalls, elicited appreciative laughter from the audience.  At the end, he judged Mrs. Drudge and Mrs. Modern based on  speed, cleanliness of the dishes, and appearance of the  contestants. The disgusted Mrs. Drudge literally threw in her  towel, especially disappointed to have failed in the last  category.  General Electric's egg-frying demonstration starred four  beauties in their bathing suits frying one egg in a bowl  hovering over a magnetic core. All these performances showed  lovely, composed women, dressed for leisure or play,  effortlessly performing the ease that American industry would  bring to housework of the future. A woman who became a consumer  of their products could complete her household duties without  surrendering her female sex-appeal. Popular fiction and  advertising from the early 20th century stress that a homemaker  must be lovely and serene as well as skilled and devoted  (Shapiro 1986, 25). \"Make your kitchen a beauty parlor for  pots and pans\" was the copy of a 1939 magazine advertizement  for SOS soap pads,3 and indeed, industrial exhibitors brought  the glamour, the indulgence, and the leisure of the beauty  parlor into the modern American kitchen, in their exhibits as  well as in their advertizing.   Two models for the kitchen of tomorrow were the Living  Kitchen designed for the America at Home exhibit by Allmon  Fordyce, and the Kitchen of the Electrified Farm. The Living  Kitchen was one of sixteen model interiors meant to display  modernity of design as well as function. Fordyce issued a  release indicating what the kitchen of the future would need to  be: The \"Living Kitchen\" is a room for the whole family to  live in. Fresh in its approach to the new needs of the  modern family, it combines the maximum comfort for daily  living and the greatest efficiency for cooking and  workspace. . . . The chief function of this kitchen is to  lighten the burden of work for the woman who is doing the  cooking and housekeeping in her own home and to provide an  opportunity for her to share the companionship of her  family and friends while she is working. . . . Less than  one per cent of the population employ servants. . . . By  sharing the room with friends, they are not \"slaves\" to  the job (NYPL box 363). By making the Living Kitchen open to the living and dining  rooms of the house, Fordyce assured women that what kitchen  work remained in the newly efficient facility was not dirty or  demeaning or low-class. On the contrary, making the  housewife's kitchen activities visible gave value to her  efficiency and attractiveness, rather than to her labor, so  much so that the kitchen became an extension of the living and  dining rooms--a place of sociability rather than burdensome  work. In her kitchen, the housewife could show herself  performing technology with perfect ease. In the kitchen at the Electrified Farm a woman prepared  food in a very large and well-equipped rural kitchen,  explaining all the steps of her work to spectators standing  outside the house and looking in the windows. A small  microphone around her neck broadcast her voice to the audience  outside, whom she did not \"see\" or acknowledge. The kitchen  exhibit, like the rest of the Electrified farm, used  naturalistic performances to show how modern electrical  equipment would be integrated into everyday life. It showed  how, in fact, Typical Americans would come into contact with  the World of Tomorrow.   The World of Tomorrow promised to change the domestic  space the housewife occupied by making her work easier and more  interesting. The average housewife would become a new kind of  Typical American, Mrs. 1939, whose presence in her kitchen  would be ornamental. Her performance would make her visible in  a way that would distinguish her tasks from those of servants,  who perform their work unseen (Barber 1940b). Time-saving  foods and labor-saving appliances having liberated her from the  drudgery of heavy kitchen work, she could create whimsical  conceits such as the sandwich loaf in the form of the frosted  cake, an emblem of how to consume industrial food, use up  surplus time, and create the visual effect of effort   Notes to part III  1. Gaige's particular interest was spices and herbs, and he  took the opportunity to include at the back of the New York  World's Fair Cookbook a section he called \"The spice shelf  today.\" Under sweet basil, for instance, Gaige wrote, \"A  little known flavor, it well rewards the experimenter.\" and  suggested using it with tomatoes. Andre Simon especially  praised the spice list in his review of the book and called it  a valuable reference (Simon 1939, 283). 2. The Electric Light and Power Company exhibition included  scenes from the bad old days of gaslight New York. While many  historians of the world's fair have noted in retrospect that  the credulous utopian enthusiasm for the future seems quaint,  it is no more quaint than a longing for an imagined past. 3. One place this advertisement appeared was Woman's Day.  April, 1940, 47.    Part IV The Typical American Table: Americanizing  Etiquette   In the World of Tomorrow, not only would architecture  become smooth and ovoid and kitchen equipment streamlined, but  outmoded coarse behavior would also be refined. Factory- prepared foods, modern electric equipment, and a typical  American diet were not to be enough for life in the World of  Tomorrow. Shoddy manners, uninformed by modern American  etiquette, lagged behind the times and also needed futurizing.  Social reformers of the first part of the century regarded the  Americanizing of table manners to be among the most important  adaptations new immigrants needed to make (Levenstein 1988  105).  The America at Home Pavilion opened in 1940, replacing the  focal exhibit of the Community Interests Zone, where Mrs.  Modern had built her house with a telephone. While in other  pavilions at the fair the future of manufacturing and  technology was on display, America at Home showed how that  technology would affect the future of the home, where many of  the new products and inventions exhibited elsewhere at the fair  would ultimately be put into practice. Not only did the  sixteen model interiors show what the inside of the typical  American home of the future might look like, but programs and  performances showed what appropriate behavior for everyday  activities might look like.   The America at Home pavilion was inaugurated with the \"All  American Dinner,\" prepared and served by Miss Edith Barber in  the Living Kitchen. The All American Dinner was followed by a  \"Cooking Quiz\" on the turntable stage which was at the center  of the America at Home pavilion. The menu for the All American  Dinner was:  Dunking Tray (Vegetables and shrimp with horseradish mayonnaise sauce) Fried Chicken Asparagus Hollandaise    Baked Potatoes Little Yeast Rolls Old-Fashioned Strawberry Shortcake Coffee All who attended received a complimentary menu with recipes.  At the \"Cooking Quiz\" after dinner, Miss Barber posed and  answered many \"controversial\" questions about the dinner menu,  among them the following:  Biscuit dough or cake batter for strawberry shortcake?  [The recipe indicated biscuit dough.] Must a man dress for dinner if a woman does? May bread be served at dinner? May coffee be served during the meal? The task of defining the role of the housewife of the  future also makes it necessary to define masculinity in the  World of Tomorrow. Must the husband of tomorrow dress for  dinner? No answer is given in the script, but the performances  at the America at Home pavilion indicate that he must.  Since the end of the nineteenth century, as American  society reacted to the absorption of large waves of immigrants,  women, and young women in particular, had been the targets of  the urban social reformers who sought to Americanize recent  immigrants with the refining influence of etiquette.  Frequently the immigrant communities themselves made the  connection between manners and Americanization (Joselit 1990,  41). Their daughters--and especially new brides--were the  targets of the improving exhibits and performances produced at  America at Home. Women, motivated to educate themselves, their  husbands and their children, were the vectors for new  information. In the fall of 1940, shortly before the fair was  to close, America at Home sponsored Bride's Day. On September  29, 1940, any bride who had married in 1940 and showed a  wedding certificate to prove it was granted free admission to  the fair--husbands still had to pay. Some of the furnishings  from the America at Home exhibit were awarded to brides as  prizes--at the end of the fair, exhibitors needed to dismantle  and dispose of their material. Other prizes were blankets,  scales, radios and cookbooks. As the Chicago Jewish Sentinel  proclaimed in 1935, a good cookbook is as indispensable to a  home as a bed (quoted in Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1990, 88). The highlight of the America at Home exhibit was the \"Live  Dinner Party,\" which was performed on the turntable stage twice  a day for a packed house of two hundred visitors. Helen  Sprackling produced the \"Live Dinner Party\" and acted as the  narrator. Two couples sat at an elegantly appointed table  eating a dinner served by a uniformed maid and conversed  comfortably as they rotated in front of their audience. A  narrator in a full-length evening gown stood off to the side  and called attention to the proper execution of dinner table  protocol. The narrator also pointed out the design of the  party. The tablecloth, the dishes, the maid's uniform, and the  hostess's dress were all blue and white. The woman guest's  dress was white and both the men were in dinner dress.  Sparkling emphasized that the performance could entertain and  edify, as well as reinforce the wife's leading role in matters  of decorum: The auditorium . . . is packed each day at both shows. . .  . The show has elicited some very pointed sighs of relief  from the women, who have been re-assured on certain  troubling points of etiquette (NYPL box 364). The costumes were the same for every performance and so was the  menu. Every meal began with Campbell's soup and every meal  ended with Jell-O, both major exhibitors at the fair. The four  diners at the \"Live Dinner Party\" ate Campbell's soup and  Jell-O twice a day in their tuxedoes whilst spinning around on  a turntable.1 Both the All American Dinner and the Live Dinner Party  presented, in their different ways, a vision for the future of  the American table. At the Live Dinner Party, diners performing  correct manners wore formal dress and ate processed foods,  while at the All American Dinner, diners wearing informal dress  and cooking their own food performed a menu related to  heritage. Both offered up a feminized version of the American  table where men, lagging behind American women in the sprint to  the future, would be refined by codified table manners and  gentler, more feminine foods. Both dinner performances were  finally performances of consumption. Proper deportment and  etiquette elevated the industrially produced food on exhibit at  the fair, and elevated the people who prepared and ate it. Enthusiastic attendance at both these model dinners would  seem to indicate that almost all of the fairgoers who came to  enjoy the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940 were striving to  become more typical. In the fifteen years since America had  severely restricted immigration the country had become more  introspective, and it was essential to American homemakers to  prove themselves as Europe was sliding into war. That hundreds  would pack the house to watch four people eating dinner  testifies to how very urgently, how very passionately,  Americans of 1940 wanted to do the right thing, the typical  thing, if only they knew what it was.    Note to Part IV  1. Another production of Sprackling's, a performance entitled  \"Bringing up Bridget\" about how a young housewife should train  her first maid, was not performed at the fair. Edith Barber's  other book published that year, Speaking of Servants, was not  on sale at America at Home along with the Edith Barber  Cookbook.     V Conclusion: The Future is not What it Used to Be  The flavors of the World of Tomorrow that industrial and  municipal exhibitors of the New York World's Fair of 1939-40  offered up to American consumers were flavors of a safe, clean  future where food, housework, domestic space, and even the  deportment of Americans themselves would be different, modern,  and better. Americans, in their cooking and eating, would  conform to the smooth lines of the fair's futuristic design  even as they conformed to one another in their efforts to  become \"typical.\"  The exhibits that valorized typicality frequently did so by  equating typicality with consumption of manufactured and  uniform goods--consumption of milk, of packaged food, and of  the many electrical appliances that would bring the kitchen up  to typical American standards. Marketing techniques appealed  to patriotism and conflated good citizenship with good  consumerism. Industrial manufacturers planned their exhibits to allow  potential consumers to look inside the manufacturing process  and see that there was nothing therein about which to be  alarmed. The spaces were vast and clean, all vessels were  transparent, and, in many cases, all the labor was carried out  by lovely young women. Food of the future as presented at the  fair would be more packaged, more processed, and more  synthetic. In 1939 many felt this was good news. Processed  and packaged food stood not for tastelessness but for safety  and hygiene. The fair's exhibits urged women in particular to steer the  way for their families in their electrified kitchens--kitchens  in which they would no longer be confined as in the old days,  but to which they would willingly return time and again, to  indulge in recreational cooking in-between their diverting and  self-improving activities. In these open and comfortable  kitchens, women of the future using factory prepared foods  could whip up impressive and decorative creations that  delighted guests and flattered the decorative cook herself. American housewives would also have the pleasure of serving  food to their families in a casually elegant atmosphere.  Uncouth behavior would be as out of place in the World of  Tomorrow as a washboard or crank's stove.  The world of tomorrow would be an America of the future  where automobiles would rule the roads, machinery would make  the lives of American workers safer and easier in the factory  and in the home. Cooking and eating in particular were to be  more streamlined and more hygienic as prepared foods and  futuristic equipment entered the American lifespace. Food  exhibits at the New York World's Fair 1939-1940 invited  visitors to throw off the outmoded prejudices of the past and  feast on the future.

{"detail": [{"content": "Feasting on the Future: Food at the New York World's Fair, 1939-1940  Eve Jochnowitz    Mr Grover Whalen N.Y. World's Fair New York City  Dear Mr. Whalen:-  I just must take the time out and let you know how happy I  am because you selected such a typical American as Kate Smith to  sing at the opening of THE FAIR, and I only wish that finances  would permit my being there. I do not think you could have found a more AMERICAN person  than Kate Smith - after all this is AMERICA the fair emblematic  of what AMERICANS CAN DO, and Kate Smith emphasizes AMERICA in  her song, praise of the country, its products, its art and music  - in fact is she not THE MOST TYPICAL PUBLIC AMERICAN  ENTERTAINER? She has the seriousness that is needed, and I only  wish that we had more \"Kate Smiths\" in America - people who  would talk their country, pat it on the back, as well as our  American made products - from soil to tapestries. It would even  be a good idea if some of our monied people would think that  American Home Furnishings, American investments, American  Scenery, etc. were BETTER than that of Foreign Lands, or makes. I certainly take my hat off to you for your selection, and  also to Kate Smith for her PERSONIFICATION of American Ideals. Much success for a 1940 Fair and I only wish I could be  there for the opening.  Yours for a successful season,  CC to Kate Smith    Mrs. A. Freeland         Rock Island, IL  (New York World's Fair 1939-1940 collection, Rare Books and  Manuscripts Division of the New York Public Library: Box 253.  Emphases and punctuation are in the original.1)   Trylon and Perisphere, the gleaming spire and globe that  became symbols of the New York World's Fair of 1939-40 and  appeared on countless World's Fair souvenirs, served as  constant reminders of the fair's message of optimism, hope for  the future, and valorization of the \"typical American.\"  Perisphere, \"the largest globe ever made by man,\" symbolized  the world we live in (with all its typicality), and Trylon, a  slender three-sided tower 700 feet tall, symbolized our  aspirations for the future.2  The food-related exhibits of the New York World's Fair  pressed the fair's official aim to present an optimistic view  of the future and its unofficial practice of honoring all that  was typically American. I will argue that in the process, the  fair's diverse exhibits created a feminized vision of the  future--a future in which women, in their many roles as food  providers, would shape their families into typical American  consumers and make the country safe for American manufacturers.  This paper will examine the food exhibits at the New York  World's Fair in relation to these themes. Part I explores the  role of food in defining \"future\" and \"typical.\" Part II  examines exhibits of food production--the farm and the factory- -in which futuristic technology would produce more \"typical\"  results. Part III, the heart of the paper, moves into the  kitchen, where the typical and the future meet in the typical  American housewife, the unsung heroine of the whole fair, who  harnesses the technology of the future to do her bidding. Part  IV discusses the exhibits devoted to manners and deportment,  which made the American table a site where Americans of all  kinds could become more typical by correcting their behaviour.  The New York World's Fair Corporation, headed by the  dashing Grover Whelan,3 selected the forward-looking theme of  \"Building the World of Tomorrow\" to be the fair's unifying  narrative, and made the celebration of the 150th anniversary of  George Washington's inauguration the putative occasion of the  fair.  The layout of the fairgrounds, which were located at the  Corona Dumps4 in Flushing Queens, followed the model of the  Great Mall in Washington, D. C. The New York City Hall  Pavilion anchored the west end of the mall, and the Court of  Peace, crowned by the United States Federal Government  Pavilion, was the anchor at the east end. In the center, and  visible from almost anywhere in the 1200 acre fairgrounds,  Trylon and Perisphere rose shimmering over their reflecting  pool. Seven zones, all of which had some food-related  exhibits, were arranged around the themes of government,  community interests, food, communications, medicine, production  and distribution, and amusement. The Federal Government Pavilion was in the Government  Zone5(see map), which included the pavilions of the states and  the foreign countries exhibiting at the fair. Many of the  foreign government pavilions offered as their main attraction  restaurants serving dishes representing their national  cuisines. In the Community Interest Zone, whose centerpiece  was the \"Town of Tomorrow,\" home-related exhibits such as gas,  furnishings, and radio shared space with the Temple of Religion  and the Jewish Palestine Pavilion. Exhibits in the Community  Interest Zone displayed technological and social advances in  kitchen work, kitchen design, and deportment intended to  improve cooking at home and dining at home in the future. Cafe  Tel Aviv, serving \"Palestine type dishes,\" was part of the  Jewish Palestine Pavilion. Immediately to the south stood the  Food Zone, where the pavilions for Borden, Swift, Heinz and  other industrial food exhibitors held their exhibits and  performances. To the west were zones for communication,  medicine, and transportation, and production and distribution,  where exhibits for Con Edison, Westinghouse, U. S. Steel, and  General Electric, among others, showed the wonders that  electrically powered kitchen equipment and modern kitchen  materials would bring to food preparation in the factory and  the home. A large Amusement Zone, with many restaurants of its  own, flanked the fair to the south, but had no place on the  Constitution Mall. A \"focal exhibit\" in each zone related that  particular zone to the World of Tomorrow. The focal exhibits  were designed by the Fair Corporation, while other buildings  were the responsibility private exhibitors. The broad and  didactic focal exhibits were unpopular, and in the second year  of the fair, all the focal exhibits closed and private exhibits  took their place.   A World's Fair is a temporary universe. Feasting on the  Future will examine the stated and unstated aims of the New  York World's Fair of 1939-1940 through the most temporary of  artefacts, food.    Notes 1. Most of the primary material for this paper is from the  correspondence and files of the New York World's Fair, courtesy  of the New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden  Foundations, Rare Books and Manuscripts Division, New York  World's Fair Records 1939-40. Material from the Astor, Lenox  and Tilden collection will hereafter be identified by the  letters NYPL and box number. 2. Trylon and Perisphere were proper names. Contemporaneous  sources were inconsistent, many referring to them as \"the  Trylon\" and \"the Perisphere.\" I have used them as names  throughout. 3. A history of Grover Whelan's peculiar and often disastrous  career as a director of exhibitions is beyond the scope of this  paper, but it is necessary to mention the dashing Mr. Whelan's  extraordinary animal magnetism, which permeates all accounts.  Letters from women and men to the fair, such as the letter I  chose as the epigraph to this paper, were frequently addressed  to Whelan personally, and filled with the warmest sentiments.  Much of the glamour associated with this particular fair was  Whelan's own. 4. Mayor LaGuardia had hoped that the fair would allow the  city to reclaim the Corona Dumps as a public park. Because of  the outbreak of World War II, the city had to postpone plans  for the park until another World's Fair, in the years 1964-65,  revived the area again. 5. I will use the capitalization conventions of the World's  Fair Corporation throughout.     PART I: Typical Americans: Perfection or Abjection?  \"Makes you proud of your country\" was the slogan of Elmer1,  mascot of the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940, and a symbol  of the typical American visitor. The source of pride is the  fair itself. Almost every exhibit and performance at the Fair,  from the pageants led by Mayor LaGuardia and Grover Whelan to  the recipe pamphlets, valorized the \"typical American.\" In the  second year of the fair, when Europe was at war, typical  Americans were themselves on display. Families from each of  the forty-eight states entered contests run by their local  newspapers to select the most typical representatives of each  state. Entrants submitted essays in which they explained why  they were typical, and winners came to live at the fair for one  week in one of the two model homes set up on the fairgrounds.  Each \"typical American family\" was presented with a one-week  lease and keys to their home by Harvey Gibson, the vice- president of the fair. Dad was always handed the lease, Mom,  the keys. Each typical American family posed for photographs  as they moved in, moved out and raised their state flag. Upon  departure, each \"typical American boy\" received a baseball  autographed by Babe Ruth. Each \"typical American girl\" got a  bracelet.  A publicity photo from the fair shows Grover Whalen, the  president of the fair, and Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia greeting  the first two typical American families to arrive at the fair.  Ironically, Mayor LaGuardia could, in his ceremonial capacity,  welcome typical families to the Fair, but his family would  never have qualified as typical. No Italian-American families  won the contest for the typical American family, nor, for that  matter, did any Black or Jewish families. All of the winning  families, two from each of the 48 states, were white and had a  mother, father and two kids. These mobile and arguably  exhibitionist families were families of the future in more ways  than the fair's planners could have known.2  Black, Jewish and Italian Americans, excluded from exhibits  of typicality, appeared on a \"Wall of Fame\" for \"Notable  Americans of Foreign Birth, Negroes and American Indians\"(NYPL  box 252). The notable Americans who made it onto the wall were  sorted by country of origin and field of endeavor. Negroes and  American Indians were included in their own categories, but no  separate category was created for Jews of foreign birth.3  The Wall of Fame committee was navigating troubled waters.  In 1939, with immigration severely restricted and war  approaching, very few were going on record to say anything good  about Americans of foreign birth. By honoring immigrants,  Negroes and American Indians, the Wall of Fame made the case  that the diversity of American achievement was no threat to  American typicality. The Wall of Fame committee tried to  distribute immigrants evenly by country and field, while  representing groups proportionally to their population. They  also had to make do with whatever actual notables they had to  work with. One memo in the Wall of Fame files states  regretfully that many German scientists had to be left out  because there were simply more than enough Germans represented  in the field of science.  Not everyone born in a particular country was considered  representative of that country, whether in their own eyes or in  the eyes of their fellow countrymen. A Mr. Frgosa protested  that there were only five Portuguese honored on the Wall of  Fame, and that all five of them were Jews. His letter, which  the committee forwarded to Father Joseph Carrella of St.  Anthony's Welfare Center, dramatizes the problem of grouping  immigrants by country. Father Carrella distanced himself and  the Portuguese community of New York from the letter writer, a  well known \"trouble maker.\" \"This man,\" wrote Father Carrella,  \"means nothing to the Portuguese. We are satisfied with the  names of the Portuguese Jews,\" he continues, \"because the  Portuguese Jews and the Portuguese were the first settlers in  the city of New York and we are proud of their record\" (NYPL  box 252). Should Jews have had a separate category? Some members of  the Committee for Jewish Palestine felt it was prudent to be  restrained about exhibiting Jewish achievement.4 No doubt  Jewish fairgoers combed through names on the Wall of Fame as  obsessively as did Frgosa to find notable Jews from various  countries. While they would not have found a category set  aside for Jews, they would have found many Jewish names, as  there was apparently no effort to limit their numbers. In  addition to comprising the entire Portuguese delegation to the  wall, Jews, with one exception, made up the entire Polish  delegation as well as most of the pared-down selection of  Germans.  In contrast to the display of typical Americans at the  fair, the Wall of Fame honored well-known individuals, such as  Samuel Goldwyn and Albert Einstein, whose fame and  extraordinary contributions made them remarkable. To win a  place on the Wall of Fame, immigrants had to be outstanding,  and their names familiar. To win the Typical Family Contest,  the families had to be ordinary. Honored Americans thus fell  into the mutually exclusive categories of typical natives and  exceptional immigrants. The exceptional achievements of non- natives were thus located in the past, while typical and  undistinguished families provided models for the future--if not  models in achievement, then models as consumers. However much the fair celebrated the typical American,  internal memos of the food committee show that the fair's  planners did not think the typical American was all that smart.  They planned the food displays accordingly. Larry K. Herzog,  who began organizing the fair's food exhibits in 1937, seems to  have had two main goals in assembling the food exhibitors:  First, to promote American industry in a time of economic  depression, and second to advance the education of \"The  average American,\" a paradigmatic individual for whom he  apparently had no great regard. In a 1937 letter to the editor  of Baker's Weekly, Herzog wrote, \"I am trying so hard to  provide a basis for the food exhibitors to help us in helping  themselves as well to push back the mental horizon of consumer  understanding as related to food\" (NYPL box 150). He  complained that the \"average housewife\" did not know about half  of the baked products available in America, and \"All the  average person thinks about\" is the finished food product  rather than the process of manufacture. Herzog's goals of  education and promotion are inextricably linked to consumption  in all the exhibits that ultimately took shape at the fair.  The average American, enlightened by the fair's educational  exhibits and warmed to American industry would become an ideal  consumer. Beatrice Mabry, director of the educational section of the  food exhibit, sought to put together suitable instruction for  informed consumers of the future. \"Does the average individual  consume approximately a ton of food a year?\" She wrote to Dr.  Louis Stanley of the United States Department of Agriculture on  March 13, 1937, \"if not, what amount? What does the human  stomach hold--a pint, a pint and a half or what\"(NYPL box 150)?  The final result of Mabry's research was a scale model of  Manhattan Island in Russell Wright's focal food exhibit with  skyscrapers and piles of food showing how much food Americans  consumed in a day. The purpose of the model buildings was to  convey the enormity of scale. Herzog and Mabry hoped that such  simple visual metaphors could educate consumers about food  painlessly, but the sight of a pile of food next to a  skyscraper turned out not to be as appealing to the public as  they might have wished.  The same combination of earnest yet wacky didacticism  continued throughout the food pavilion. Exhibits in the focal  food exhibit used surreal visual metaphors to explain the  miracles of futuristic food technology. Wright intended these  vivid and colorful images to make the scientific and industrial  aspects of food manufacture seem warm and wholesome. Display  cases held flying lobsters, an aqueduct squirting roses into  the desert, an alligator pear (avocado) with five jewels, an  eye winking in a cave, a clock running backward inside a tin  can and a cauliflower wearing boxing gloves knocking out a  centipede. No labels accompanied the exhibit. A recorded  voice, when it was working, explained that the flying lobsters  represented the miracle of refrigerated transportation, the  roses stood for modern irrigation, the jewels in the avocado  symbolized such ordinary things and vitamins and fats, the eye  stood for the vitamin cure for night-blindness, the clock in  the can showed how canning made time stand still for fresh food  and of course the cauliflower protected by pesticides defeated  parasitic vermin. Unfortunately, the recorded voice was not  always working, causing one student of display to note wryly  that \"The mystery of those aerial crustaceans was wearing us  down\" (Cummings 1940, 94). The humor in these whimsical  displays made the case to potential consumers that  technological food manufacture was not cold and forbidding, but  friendly and inviting. The fair planners felt strongly that visitors needed  exactly this kind of gentle instruction to make the country  safe for industrial food manufacturers and their internal memos  show that there was a wide gulf between what they wished to  show typical Americans to be and what the fair's planners  thought typical Americans actually were. In spite of drawing  better crowds than any of the other focal exhibits, the focal  food exhibit received mixed reviews and closed in 1940, as did  the other focal exhibits, to make way for the Coca-Cola  pavilion. The focal food exhibit's designers were not alone in their  urgent desire to improve the unschooled eating practices of  average Americans. Not only America's scientists, but also the  clergy felt that uninformed eating was a threat not only to  health, but to morality, religion, and the nation's future. In  \"Man's future depends on what he decides to eat,\" Scientific  Monthly concluded that \"Not enough of us are making the three- times-a-day decision as wisely as might be\" (\"Man's future  depends\" 1938, 374).  \"The churches are in the midst of an all but losing fight  with the restaurants for the souls of men.\" was the alarmed  cry of the Zion Herald: Organ of American Methodism, which  argued that a startling number of souls had been \"damned by bad  food\" (\"Food and Religion\" 1939, 38). The hurried thoughtless  eating so typical in America was to the Herald very much a  moral issue as well as a health issue. The Organ of American  Methodism would not have used the word \"damned\" lightly. The  same urgency felt by their contemporaries the Italian futurists  informs the argument of the scientists and the clergy.5  Food corporations that exhibited at the fair took up the  fight for better informed eating in the recipe booklets that  were distributed free at their pavilions at the fair. The  Sealtest recipe pamphlet for the World's Fair includes a short  essay by Professor R. B. Stoltz of Ohio State University that  manages to address concerns about health and morality in its  promotion of milk as a beverage for adults: The typical American, when handed a menu to designate  his choice of beverages, usually replies, \"I'll take  milk.\" This is true for all seasons of the year. The 130  million people, who live in the United States, do not  realize how milk conscious we are. Almost unknowingly we  appreciate the food value of milk and its effect upon our  physical, mental and moral acts. . . .  In most foreign countries milk is not considered a  beverage for the adults. Neither do those adults usually  have the pep, initiative and enthusiasm that can be found  in a group of typical Americans (Sealtest Inc. 1939, 11).  A \"Professor,\" a scientific spokesperson for the future,  not an old-fashioned chef or a farmer, endorses milk. His  arguments in favor of milk are very much in line with the  fair's elevation of typical Americans. Because typical  Americans do drink milk, Americans should drink milk. The  descriptive is prescriptive. Furthermore, foreigners drink  less milk than Americans and they are the worse for it  physically, mentally, and morally. Sealtest was correct in  predicting that with war imminent, their customers would want  to approximate the typical American and not the unspecified,  lackluster foreigner.  Elmer and Mrs. Modern: Two views for the Future  Elmer the typical American is a particularly rich, if  conflicted, symbol. Elmer is a middle-aged white male. He  wears a striped three-piece suit with a watch chain in his vest  pocket. His ample build, slightly unfashionable suit and hat,  and unflagging joviality point to the out-of-town origins of  this small town businessman at this New York fair. \"Elmer-- Jolly, average, everyday American--is being immortalized in  countless posters this year sounding the keynote of informality  and country fair spirit of the World's Fair of 1940\" (NYPL box  1496). Elmer is meant to be a typical visitor to the fair, not  the typical New Yorker. He is photographed greeting  celebrities, eating hot dogs and baking strawberry shortcake,  but he usually poses with thumbs in vest sleeves--An American  mudra for prosperity and contentment. Elmer was hugely  popular, still, no one would want to be like Elmer, whom the  Sayre, Pennsylvania Evening Times described in one editorial  as \"Plump, moist and a bit of a chump\" (\"We are not a nation of  Elmers\" 1940, n.p.). The editorial states that Americans are  not \"gullible\" like Elmer. The editors clearly read Elmer's  signifiers of typicality as signifiers of gullibility.  A river of difference flowed between New York, host city to  the fair, and the rest of the country, whence the typical  Americans displayed at the fair came. The fair chose to locate  Americanness outside of the big city in an attempt to appeal to  the whole country. While official literature at the fair  ignored the tension, outside sources documented it gleefully.  The cartoons in Trylongs and Perisites (O'Leahy 1939) suggest  how many New Yorkers must have viewed the swarms of out-of-town  visitors descending on the city to visit the fair. Out-of-  towners in the cartoons have long, pointed beaks that look like  Trylon, and spherical heads that look like Perisphere, the  symbols of the fair. Trylongs and Perisites lampoons out-of- town guests and the discomforts of keeping them. A couple eat  their breakfast in the nude as an indignant \"Perisite\" stalks  out the door, her provincial prudery used against her, in \"How  to get rid of a maiden aunt,\" and a graveyard filled with  stones shaped like Trylon and Perisphere contains one with the  inscription: \"Friends And Relations With Me Would Stay/ To Hail  The Dawn of A New Day./ I Had to Steal And Beg And Borrow/ Now  I'm In The World of Tomorrow (O'Leahy 1939, n.p.). The editors  of the Evening News were not wrong to guess that in spite of  the enthusiastic language welcoming visitors and stressing the  virtues of all-American small-town typicality, the fair's  planners and New Yorkers themselves might have held typical  Americans in some disdain. Elmer, the typical American, is clearly marked as an  American of the past. There is no one poster persona analogous  to Elmer for the American of the future, but all the prototypes  for future Americans performed at the fair were gendered  female. In 1939, the Community Interest focal exhibit sought to  show the interdependence of all modern Americans. \"Mrs.  Modern,\" an animated figure, made telephone calls to order all  the elements of her house, down to the ingredients for dinner.  The act of building the physical house itself, surely a  masculine task in the American imagination, became an act of  female consumption. The wife became the complete \"homemaker\"  right down to the physical construction of the house. Harvey  Gibson acknowledges the supremacy of the female homemaker when  he hands the lease of the fair's model home to the Typical  American Husband, but hands the keys to the Typical American  Wife. The fair's food and home-related exhibits called upon  the woman, as the head of consumer choices in her home, to lead  homesteading on the next frontier, the technological age.   In 1939, the future could not come soon enough. The  period between the world wars was a time of great anxiety about  the future of the food supply. Even before the Depression, in  the prosperous decade of the twenties, the country was seized  by fears that either the world was running out of food, or that  average Americans simply would not eat what was good for them  (Levenstein 1988, 176). The food exhibits at the New York  World's Fair of 1939-1940 reassured fairgoers that in the  World of Tomorrow, thanks to the chemist's flask and the  housewife's telephone, there would be plenty of food to go  around and it would be readily available. Educational exhibits  showed Americans how to partake of the food of the future. The  technology of tomorrow would make the drudgery of cooking and  housework obsolete. The average middle-class housewife, who  could no longer depend on servants as she had in the previous  century would now have \"mechanical servants\" to do her  bidding (Rydell 1993, 124). Fairgoers would learn how to  remake themselves even as they remade America for the future  particularly through food, cooking, and eating.    Notes to Part I 1. Leslie Oestereicher, a heavy-set man in his mid-forties,  posed for most of the Elmer images.  2. Robert Rydell identifies this and other world's fair  exhibits with an ominous eugenicist agenda on the part of the  exhibition committees (Rydell 1993, 38-60 and passim). Rydell  is correct that racism played a role in the decisions of the  selection committee, but he misses the point that the typical  American families are a self-selected group whose desire to be  typical was their own.   3. While this is not a paper about the display of Jews in  particular at the world's fair, it is useful to examine the  display issues concerning Jews because of the anomalous  category they form. 4. Dr S. Margoshes wrote of those who were uncomfortable with  these exhibits, \"Still others wondered whether a Jewish exhibit  showing the colossal Jewish contributions to America would not  have the effect of arousing more \"rishus\" by affording an  opportunity to our enemies to renew their contention that the  Jews were in control of the U. S.\" (NYPL box 211).  5. Discourse at the New York World's Fair and in the  contemporary American press on the future of food and eating in  America might provide a worthwhile mirror for Filippo  Marinetti's Futurist Cookbook:  The Futurist culinary revolution has the lofty, noble  and universally expedient aim of changing radically the  eating habits of our race, strengthening it, dynamizing it  and spiritualizing it with brand new food combinations. .  . Until now men have fed themselves like ants, rats, cats  or oxen. . . . It is not by chance that this work is  published during a world economic crisis, which has  clearly inspired a dangerous and depressing panic. . . .  We propose as an antidote to this panic a Futurist way of  cooking, that is: optimism at the table (Marinetti 1932,  21). Often treated as a joke and its more outrageous recipes quoted  out of context, The Futurist Cookbook touches on concerns that  made many Americans in the 1930's uneasy about food and eating.  Marinetti's image of men feeding themselves like rats or oxen  is not so different from the disdain of the New York World's  Fair's planning committees toward the average American when it  came to food.     Part II The Future of Farm and Factory  At previous American expositions the privileged site for  any food display was the farm. The World Colombian Exposition  of 1893 in Chicago featured a Corn Palace, a knight made of  prunes, and an elephant made entirely of walnuts (Longone  1994). By 1939, ingenious displays of abundant produce were  displaced by dazzling displays farm technology. The focal  exhibit on food displayed the benefits of modern irrigation and  pesticides (represented by a cauliflower wearing boxing  gloves). The Electrified Farm exhibit demonstrated modern  farming equipment and techniques. The Electric Light and Power  Company's \"Olde Dairy Farm\" exhibit, showed women in hoop  skirts hand-milking cows and toting heavy milk-pails. Such  displays demonstrated the kind of farm work that was not to be  part of the World of Tomorrow, and provided a contrast to the  effortless work of the future. Exhibits of working women set  up the same dichotomy between kitchen work of the past and  future, as I will show in the next section.   Fresh From the Factory   The farm, however, was merely a footnote. The food of  tomorrow was to come from the American factory. The New York  Times predicted in 1938 that an entirely synthetic food supply  might soon make the laboratory the primary source of American  food (\"An entirely synthetic supply\" 1938, 16). \"Will the  Chemist's Flask do the Work of 1000 Farms?\" asked a display  that showed an agricultural landscape inside a flask. To ask  the question was to answer it. The optimistic response this  question elicited from the fairgoer was yes. In 1939, the idea  that all the food of the future might be synthetic was good  news. Most prognostications about the future of food in the  1930s were grim alarms about an approaching famine and  possibility of widespread starvation because of uncontrollable  population growth. In truth, in the 1930s millions of people in  the United States were severely undernourished with no clear  relief in sight (Levenstein 1993, 4). Exhibiting mass- production of factory food suited the fair perfectly. The mass  production of food in model factories would not only save  America from hunger, but would also do so while mirroring the  streamlined aesthetics of Futurama and Democracity. National  brands such as Wonder Bread produced consistency that made it  possible for Americans to eat identical, and typically  American, food everywhere. Industrialized food streamlined  regional and ethnic differences.  The love affair between the fair and industrial food  manufacturers began in the very earliest stages of planning,  when Larry Herzog wrote to the Chicago Board of Trade: I am particularly interested in getting across to the  ultimate consumer visitor the real story behind the static  packaged foods on the shelves at the grocer's store.  People have no conception of these things; all the average  person thinks about is the farm at one end and the  grocery store at the other, but the amount of capital,  investment, brain, brawn, courage and gamble that lies  between these two terminal points is to them a closed  book (NYPL box 149). Almost every food exhibit made the process of food manufacture  transparent, and emphasized the realness of the process  displayed. Just as the \"real skeleton\" in the Hall of Man drew  visitors, and actual fetuses were on display,1 the look  through, the look inside, the almost illicit glimpse behind the  scenes was an irresistible draw for amusement seekers in 1939- 1940. The Hall of Medicine provided a look inside virtual  human bodies, and the industrial food exhibits took visitors  inside virtual factories to see the hidden processes of  commercial food manufacture. Fairgoers loved to see what was  usually unseen, the fair's planners felt that average Americans  did not know enough about their food to be informed consumers,  and the manufacturers may have felt that fairgoers knew too  much. Industrial food manufacturers needed particularly to  exhibit themselves on their own terms to dispel consumer  uneasiness about the unknown, and to allay consumer concerns  about abuse and neglect in industrial food manufacture.  Every industrial food exhibit, whether it employed performance,  cinema, dioramas, or all three, strove above all to build  confidence among potential consumers by emphasizing the  cleanliness and safety of food manufacture. Many food  corporations felt that the official focal exhibit of the fair  did not dwell sufficiently on the processing stage in food.  Food Industries magazine referred ominously to unspecified  \"best sellers\" that had dragged food manufacturers through the  mud in print (Miller 1939, 59). The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair,  first published in 1906 and very well known in 1939, was one of  the first and most famous efforts by muckraking journalists to  reveal the inner workings of food manufacture. The best answer  to these \"best sellers,\" Miller claimed, was full disclosure of  \"how it's made\" and \"how it's done.\" Food manufacturers  needed to reveal their own inner workings and to do so on their  own terms. If only consumers could visit their factories,  they would see how sanitary and responsible they were. Model  factories at the fair allowed all who entered to see the  hygienic, even sterile, conditions in which workers processed  and packaged their products.  Beautiful young women dressed in spotless white, like  nurses or laboratory technicians, at many of the fair's food  pavilions dramatized the cleanliness and wholesomeness of the  products they presented. Swift, the meat-packing company that  had been Sinclair's primary target, peopled its plant at the  fair with young women in white lab coats who demonstrated the  wrapping of bacon and other Swift products.  These brides of science inspired confidence in the  manufacturing process by showing that food handling work was  light enough, clean enough and safe enough for women to do.  These immaculately dressed young women could hardly be  committing the wretched acts of abuse, neglect, and brutality  that Sinclair and others had exposed early in the century. By  staffing their model factories with women, the industrial food  manufacturers, like the fair's focal exhibits, feminized the  future. Just as the typical American wife, as the perfect  consumer, could build the home of tomorrow using only her  telephone, typical young women became the handmaidens of  industry once technology had shifted \"manpower\" away from the  male body and onto the machine. Even the streamlined forms of  the future were rounded and soft.  Rotating Cows and Little Bakers: Performances Produced for  the Fair  Food exhibitors at the fair had to create a show worth  seeing out of subject matter that was frequently of little  \"visual interest\" (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1991, 386). The  Borden company put cows on the \"Rotolactor,\" a merry-go-round  on which the cows stood while modern machines did the milking.  Cows standing in their stalls for milking may or may not have  drawn spectators, but the Rotolactor, even though it was the  butt of endless jokes, was a huge success. Five million  visitors came to the focal food exhibit, but almost eight  million \"stopped and ah'ed\" at the Borden Rotolactor (Miller  1940, 48). The Rotolactor was \"a ten-strike . . . designed not  to assist in the milking, but to allow a great number of people  to watch the process all at once. Watch they surely did . . .  and then not a few marched across the aisle to the salesroom to  take part in the drinking\" (Cummings 1940, 83). Food  Industries magazine cited the Borden exhibit as the best  example of the need for performance in a world's fair exhibit.  \"Almost every foot of Borden's 80,000 sq. ft. exhibit was a  show. . . . If any manufacturer failed to obtain ample returns  for the investment the blame can only be placed on his act.  He did not put on a good show\" (Miller 1940, 48). Borden also provided an ice cream factory show,  demonstrations of milk being pasteurized, irradiated and  bottled, and a pen of twenty calves, \"replaced every three  weeks to insure their being of a cute age\" (\"Food  Manufacturers' Exhibits\" 1939, 255). To guide visitors, Borden  hired \"15 girl college graduates, selected from more than 100  candidates as information girls for the Borden Company's Dairy  World of Tomorrow\" (NYPL box 149). The information girls were  graduates of Barnard, Smith, Radcliffe, Hunter and Brooklyn  College who were trained to answer \"all predictable questions  from visitors to the Borden Building.\"2 Borden was especially  proud to have among its info girls the triplets Frances,  Marguerite and Catherine Kirshner.3 In 1940 Borden added to the  above an exhibit called \"Elsie in her boudoir,\" an actual cow  standing in a bed shaped stall in a room decorated as a young  woman's bedroom. The youth, freshness and cuteness of the  calves and the information girls (although there is no mention  of how often they had to be replaced) reinforced the message  that milk is a fresh and healthful food. They were also part  of the show. The use of lovely young women by Borden, Swift  and other food companies exhibiting at the fair was not just  the same ordinary sexual exploitation indulged in at Aquacade  and other amusement zone displays at the fair, but a vision of  the feminine form of the future.  The George Washington Coffee Refining Company had \"comely  college girls demonstrating its product\" (\"Food manufacturer's  exhibits\" 1939,44). The Junket Folks boasted that their  desserts were served by attractively attired attendants.  Pretty \"info girls\" guided visitors through Borden's Dairy  World of Tomorrow. Food Industries magazine stated with  approval that pretty girls added \"drama and action\" to the  show. In its bid to attract visitors, the Loose-Wiles Sunshine  Baking company produced a musical vaudeville show for a company  of diminutive bakers. Beech-Nut made a toy circus and circus  parade the main part of its exhibit, which also included  factory demonstrations. The Heinz company, which introduced  the familiar pickle pin at the World's Colombian Exposition in  1893, had a musical revue starring a line of precision dancers  and Mr. Tomato Head, a top-hatted robot. \"Pep up with  Doughnuts\" was the theme of the well-attended demonstrations of  the Doughnut Company of America. After live performances,  color motion pictures drew the most viewers. Nabisco, Coca- Cola, and Planter's all showed movie cartoons for children  about their products. Both Coca-Cola's and Nabisco's movies  starred Mickey Mouse.  Exhibitors also used the fragrance of fresh food to draw  the curious and the hungry. Standard Brands attracted visitors  to the coffee exhibit with the aroma of coffee freshly roasted  at the roasting demonstration. Many fairgoers waited around to  buy the fragrant apple pies they had just seen assembled and  baked at Mrs. Wagner's baking company. Scent was also used by  some of the non-food exhibitors, with varying results. An  orange blossom scent filled the entire Florida pavilion. The  Coty pavilion, and for some reason the Federal pavilion, both  perfumed the air at their exhibits, making them quite  disgusting.4  Futuristic Precision: The Lost Matzo Performance of the  Fair  While matzo might not seem an exemplar of the food of the  future, the Department of Industrial Exhibits attempted,  without success, to bring a matzo baking performance to the New  York World's Fair. In April 1938, Edward Carlin of the  Department of Industrial Exhibits sent an enthusiastic letter  to Frederick Margareten at Horowitz Brothers and Margareten  with his proposal: I think that perhaps a model of your bakery, showing  the process by which your various products are made,  under the most sanitary and painstaking conditions  [emphasis in the original] with regard to both public  health and taste would make a most interesting exhibit. Carlin does not specifically mention matzo, but matzo is  the product that Horowitz baked. \"Sanitary and painstaking\"  were code words for kosher in this context. A working matzo  bakery on the fairgrounds would certainly have provided both  the educational value and the fast action the fair organizers  desired. Carlin also indicates that he was interested in  exhibiting Kashrut, a part of Jewish law that would be in  keeping with the values of the World of Tomorrow, including  cleanliness, speed, and precision. While not values most  fairgoers might associate with Jews, they were important to  consumers of the future, Jewish and non-Jewish alike. Carlin  urged Margareten to consider that \"every one of the fifty- million visitors [to the fair] is a potential buyer of your  products.\"  Horowitz Brothers and Margareten expressed only lukewarm  interest, and there is no record of matzo being present at the  fair in any form. Carlin did get his working bakery, though,  from the Continental Baking Company, which produced Wonder  Bread. Every detail of the baking process was displayed, down  to the growing and harvest of the wheat from a wheat field on  the fairgrounds. Continental's promotional material proudly  emphasized that this was New York City's first wheat field in  sixty-eight years. Just as wheat for matzo must be guarded  from the time it ripens on the stalk, the wheat for Wonder  Bread was never out of public sight. Continental encouraged  fairgoers to come back to the fair and look at the wheat during  different stages of the growing season. Penelope Shoo, the  bosomy \"scarecrow of tomorrow\" wearing a Hattie Carnegie gown,  guarded the Wonder Bread wheat field and gave it a touch of  pizzazz. You can spend as little as 20 minutes or as long as an  hour in watching the automatic process of baking bread  but, in passing through the bakery there is one thought to  keep in mind. Each single action you see, manual or  mechanical, must be timed exactly so that every loaf of  Wonder Bread will go through its 10 1/2 hour career  steadily and without interruption (NYPL box 150). The ten and a half hours required to make Wonder Bread may  not be the eighteen minutes needed to make matzo but the  exactness is what they have in common.  A Gigantic Public Service: Selling the Future of Food  The combined efforts of the food focal and . . . food  companies should convince visitors that food industries  are performing a gigantic public service, that food  processing is a highly technological and efficient  business and that people should pay some attention to  nutritional value in food products (\"Food at the World's  Fair\" 1939, 225). At the New York World's Fair, industrial food exhibitors made  their case for the future to the public.5 In the World of  Tomorrow, foods prepared in the factory would be safer, for a  public concerned about sanitation, and more plentiful and  reliable, for a public concerned with want (\"Death Cannot  Poison Food Inspected, Sterilized and Packaged\" was the  reassuring message of an exhibit about federal inspection).  Uninformed average Americans, for whom the displays were  designed, would come away from the fair with a new  understanding of the value of industrial food processing,  while mass produced and processed food would make the basis for  a new American cuisine in which all typical Americans could  partake.     Notes to Part II  1. Fetuses occupied a very different social space in 1939. A  contemporary critic said of this exhibit that \"If a flag is  good, an embryo or two would be sure fire for a big hand\"  (Cummings 1940, 24).  2. The description of the information girls, with its  emphasis on their being a very select group of recent college  graduates is almost identical to descriptions of the tour  guides at the United Nations (Tatomirovic 1985) and the famous  Harvey Girls. The fair was not alone in employing the  irresistible combination of tourism, food and beautiful women.  For more on the touristic use of uniformed lovelies, see  Tatomirovich 1985, Jochnowitz 1997, and Haber 1997.  3. The Kirshner Triplets, along with all visitors to the  Borden who chose to volunteer, were fingerprinted by the New  York City Police Department. Assured that their fingerprints  would be filed separately from those of criminals, many agreed  to try out the new experience of fingerprinting. Borden's  visitors were at once consumers of spectacle and objects of  surveillance.  4. Professor Michael Coe, personal correspondence. 5. The committee for industrial exhibits chose not to include  proposed exhibits which did not further their agenda of linking  factory produced food and the future. George Kern of Iowa did  not receive space to display his \"World Famous Petrified Ham.\"     Part III Freedom for Mrs. 1939: Cooking in the  Kitchen of Tomorrow   The World of Tomorrow will seem less utopian and more  practical to the women than perhaps it does to the men.  It fits into the dreams and wishful thinking in which  women, particularly mothers of families, have indulged for  more than a generation. . . . The fair hopes to prove it  isn't enough to install a mechanical refrigerator in one's  home. It will show how to get the best use out of that  refrigerator for cheaper, better, food and a happier and  more leisurely family life. It will even suggest cultural  and recreational programs for the employment of the  leisure time (NYPL box 209).  Exhibits that portrayed the future of the American home  situated the typical American housewife right in the World of  Tomorrow. Like previous American fairs, the 1939 New York  World's Fair had planned to set aside a Women's Pavilion. A  committee headed by Mrs. Vincent Astor took on the job of  sifting through the diverse submissions for such a pavilion.  Ultimately the committee on Women's Exhibits decided it was  better not to segregate women in their own pavilion, partly  because any such pavilion would necessarily emphasize  achievements of the past and not the contribution of women to  the World of Tomorrow. As it happened, women were more visible  at this fair, and more active behind the scenes, than at any  previous American fair, and certainly more so than at the  subsequent 1964 World's Fair in New York. Robert Moses, who  presided over the 1964 exposition, was harshly critical of  Grover Whalen's attention to women's issues in the planning of  the 1939 fair. A contemporary remembers Moses complaining that  Whelan always had \"a bunch of cuties around him and how one  would say, 'Grover, we ought to have a dress shop' and there'd  be a dress shop at the fair. Moses said something about how he  didn't want 'no goddamn babes around me'\" (Caro 1974, 815). It  is worth noting that the New York World's Fair of 1939 may have  been the only American Exposition that did have a men's  building. Man, His Clothes, His Parts was a pavilion devoted  to men's fashion and leisure, subjects that previously had been  set aside for women only. The new American woman would require  a new kind of American man.  Fairgoers could consider some of the possible roles for  this new American woman in an exhibit entitled \"Factory  Preparation Frees Mrs. 1939,\" which introduced the focal food  exhibit. The exhibit showed a well-dressed young woman  surrounded by tiny icons representing sports equipment, playing  cards, programs from concerts and a charity bazaar, a  psychoanalysis text and a ballot. The focal food exhibit echoed  the assertion of the industrial exhibits that the homemaker of  tomorrow would be an energetic and sophisticated young woman  who played sports, attended concerts, and did good works. She  would show psychological insight and civic responsibility. She  would not be an overworked unattractive drudge. Factory  preparation of food, by freeing women from drudgery, could  benefit all of society. The gradual elimination of home  cooking was to be good news for the American wife, for the  American family, and for the country itself  The Potato People Have a Job to Do: Recipes Descriptive  and Prescriptive   The general housewife does not know how to prepare and  cook mushrooms properly. With the large amount of  mushrooms now being grown, it is essential that the  housewife be educated as to how to prepare them and serve  them and with this in mind, the mushroom people  contemplate cooking and roasting their product [at the  fair] before the public. The artichoke people in California know they must  educate the general public to use artichokes. The avocado people are in the same boat and, strange  as it may seem, the potato people have a job to do.  --Letter from Joseph Sicker to B. S. Pickett of the  American Pomological Society. Feb. 28 1940 ( NYPL box 148) None of the shiny new equipment of the future, none of the  safe hygienic packaged foods displayed by manufacturers, none  of the American produce shown at the fair would do the American  family much good if no one knew how to use them, the  prerequisite to buying them. The director of fruit and  vegetable exhibits, who came on board in 1940, complained that  typical Americans, personified again as the \"general  housewife,\" do not even know how to cook a potato, let alone  such exotic produce as artichokes and avocados.  Industrial exhibitors' lively cooking demonstrations and  colorful promotional recipe pamphlets included both corporate  iconography and images from the fair in their design. Recipes  in the pamphlets fulfilled their stated aim of instructing  typical American cooks in the use of their products and their  underlying mission to increase consumption of those products.  The presence of recipes greatly increased the chances that  visitors would keep the pamphlets. In these recipes, prepared  products, such as dressings and spice combinations, stand in  for raw ingredients. They challenge the cook to show her  ingenuity in using prepared foods rather than her skill in  cooking from scratch.  In the Durkee Famous Foods Recipes for a Century of  Progress booklet, the \"sandwich loaf\" is dressed up as a  frosted layer cake. I quote this recipe in its entirety to  convey the full force of its genius and ghastliness.  Sandwich Loaf Remove crust from loaf of sandwich bread and slice  legnthwise into four layers. spread slices of bread with  Troco or Dinner Bell Margarine, then spread with desired  fillings. Here are some suggestions: RED FILLING . . . Ham finely ground, mixed with  chopped pimiento and Durkee's mayonnaise. Salmon may be  used instead of ham. YELLOW FILLING: Yolks of hard-boiled eggs, grated and  mixed with Durkee's Mayonnaise. GREEN FILLING: Sweet pickles, watercress or parsley,  olives and nuts, chopped and mixed with Durkee's  mayonnaise. WHITE FILLING: Cream cheese, grated cucumber mixed  with Durkee's mayonnaise. Tuna fish or chicken may also  be used. Put the layers together then wrap loaf tightly in damp  cloth or wax paper and chill thoroughly in refrigerator.  When ready to serve, cover the loaf with the following  mixture: Two packages of cream cheese softened with 8 oz. jar  of Durkee's Salad Aid and one teaspoon Durkee's  Worcestershire Sauce. Spread on outside of loaf as you  would ice a cake. Garnish with slices of stuffed olives,  tomatoes, lemon and sprays of parsley. Cut loaf into  slices 3/4 inch thick and serve. If desired, two kinds of bread may be used,  alternating white and whole wheat (DFF Inc. 1933).  This is a recipe for a special occasion. While the  ingredients--white bread, margarine, mayonnaise and cream  cheese--may themselves be unremarkable, the \"layer cake\" is.  What a cook performs when she prepares this sandwich loaf or  any of the many cleverly disguised recipes of this type is not  technical skill at cooking--that is merely a mechanical skill  better done by machines. Rather, she is performing creativity  and playfulness, now that she is liberated from the drudgery of  making fresh mayonnaise. The resulting sandwich-cake would be  pretty. It would also be a sodden, greasy mess. The recipe is  brilliant in its masquerade as a cake, but inconcerned with the  flavor or texture of the dish.  Similarly, the Sealtest company offered new ideas for that  familiar standby, macaroni and cheese. The Macaroni Croquettes  recipe instructed the cook to form the cooked macaroni and  cheese into balls, roll in beaten eggs and dry crumbs, and  deep-fry. Futuristic macaroni would not be served in a  shapeless pile on a plate, but in a smooth seamless space-age  sphere that recalled the architecture of the Sealtest pavilion  and Perisphere itself.  The World's Fair also authorized a cookbook of its own,  the New York World's Fair Cook Book by Crosby Gaige. The book  sweeps over the country twice, once by region and once again by  state. \"The New York World's Fair Cookbook celebrated regional  differences that The World of Tomorrow sought for the most part  to erase. Futurama and Democracity were completely a-regional  locations. The New York World's Fair Cookbook is one of only a  few indicators that becoming typical Americans did not have to  mean becoming identical Americans.  States' Evidence presents typical menus chosen by home  economists at their respective state universities. The menus  are emphatically regional in choice and combination of  ingredients, as well as in names for dishes. The menu from  South Carolina, composed by Mrs. John Hargrove calls for:  Berkeley County tomato juice Southern fried chicken Charleston rice Cream Gravy Monetta buttered asparagus  Lake City string beans with salt pork Fort Motte artichoke relish Whole wheat biscuit Beaufort lettuce hearts Ambrosia Mother's pound cake Coffee Orangeburg salted pecans (Gaige 1939, 263)   The main course of fried chicken with cream gravy is  notably southern, and the rice typical of the coastal  Carolinas. Lake City string beans may not be different from  other string beans, but the practice of seasoning string beans  with salt pork is regional. The Wisconsin menu includes  \"Cheesets,\" toasted croutons which are midwestern in style and  in makeup. Cut day-old bread into slices two inches thick. Cut  each slice into four cubes. Dredge in melted Wisconsin  Butter, roll in grated Wisconsin hard nippy cheese and  bake in preheated oven (300 F.) until puffy and slightly  browned. (ten to fifteen minutes). Serve with soup,  salad, or at teatime (277). The dishes in the Wisconsin menu promote the state by promoting  consumption of the state's major food products--butter and  cheese.  The attention paid in the New York World's Fair Cookbook to  regional differences was only just becoming fashionable in  American cookbooks in the 1930's (Levenstein 1993, 37-39;  Mendelson 1996, 230). The cookbook was ahead of its time as  well in its acknowledgement of \"Native American Cookery\": The cooks of America ought to raise their best  stirring spoons in salute to this friendly standby, [corn]  our gift from the first Americans. Thank you Oquagas,  Narragansetts, Penobscots, Senecas, Seminoles, Chocktaws,  Algonquins, Iroquois, Shoshones, Navahos, Cherokees and  all the others (ix)! In 1939 the term \"Native American\" was more commonly used to  distinguish longer established European Americans from recent  immigrants than to refer to American Indians.1  When Washday was Sloshday: Re-imagining the Future of  Housework  Ladies, when you're feeling especially sorry for  yourselves, go to FORWARD MARCH AMERICA, the Electric  Light and Power Company's exhibit at the New York World's  Fair. See how your mothers and grandmothers had to keep  house with no more equipment than a crank's stove, broom,  washtub and washboard, plus a sad iron. Then push buttons  in your own house and see how easy your housekeeping is  with Electricity to help you (NYPL box 1435). \"When Washday was Sloshday\" was one of the many vivid  tableaux vivants at the Electric Light and Power Company's  exhibit at the fair. A weary woman wearing layers of rags  scrubbed clothes on an iron washboard. Exhibitors at the fair,  and the numerous women's magazines in which they advertized,  repeatedly and strenuously assured women who work in the home  that their work was easier than household work had been in the  past, and that they themselves were lovelier than their mothers  and grandmothers had been. They had never had it better,  according to American Cookery: New products for the month! First, brewed coffee put  up in cans, all ready to be served hot or cold. Second,  paper tea balls, using perforated paper that is  waterproof. Life gets easier and easier, doesn't it girls  (Ford 1939, 497)? The kitchen of the past was not a nostalgic hearth, but a  domestic chamber of horrors from which all American women  should be thankful to have escaped. Indeed, the complete  absence of any nostalgia for the past distinguishes the World  of Tomorrow (Rydell 115; Cusker 117).2 This section examines  how various exhibits at the fair presented what was wrong with  the American kitchen of the past and how it could be fixed for  the future. Cooking would be quicker, easier, and more  hygienic. Quicker cooking, this argument ran, would free the  American woman to pursue various activities outside the home  even though in 1939 housewives in their electrified kitchens  may well have been busier than ever (Cowan 1983, 99). The Forward March America exhibit was clearly aimed at  women. They were most directly affected by the electrical  revolution in the kitchen, and were probably responsible for  their families' purchases of equipment. The tone of the Forward  March America exhibits was harsh because it was meant to  disabuse young American women of any fond illusions about the  past. The Electrical Light and Power Company was depending on  the women of the future to become educated and enthusiastic  consumers of electrical power. Forward March America drove  home the point that it was especially women they called to  march into forward to the future by pairing their tableau on  kitchen work with one on hairdressing. The Electric Light and  Power Company abjected the fashions of the past as well as the  kitchen technology of the past in a tableau entitled Beauty and  the Least: Not only did ladies burden themselves with hair too  long for comfort and convenience, but said hair had to be  dried slowly with the doubtful help of a palm leaf fan.  Next time you girls glibly order a shampoo and finger  wave, think of the girls who spent all day getting ready  for a date (NYPL box 1435). Westinghouse also made explicit the link between the  futures of feminine spheres of kitchen work and grooming when  they staged \"The Battle of the Centuries,\" a dishwashing  contest between two pretty young women, \"Mrs. Drudge,\" who  washed dishes by hand, and \"Mrs. Modern,\" who used a  Westinghouse dishwasher. The battle was performed every day in  the Westinghouse pavilion, and always pulled a crowd. Mrs.  Drudge, with loose shoulder length hair, raced to wash dishes  over a steaming sink, while Mrs. Modern, with short styled  hair, stood calmly beside her dishwasher. A male narrator gave  rapid, ringside commentary, which, along with Mrs. Drudge's  pratfalls, elicited appreciative laughter from the audience.  At the end, he judged Mrs. Drudge and Mrs. Modern based on  speed, cleanliness of the dishes, and appearance of the  contestants. The disgusted Mrs. Drudge literally threw in her  towel, especially disappointed to have failed in the last  category.  General Electric's egg-frying demonstration starred four  beauties in their bathing suits frying one egg in a bowl  hovering over a magnetic core. All these performances showed  lovely, composed women, dressed for leisure or play,  effortlessly performing the ease that American industry would  bring to housework of the future. A woman who became a consumer  of their products could complete her household duties without  surrendering her female sex-appeal. Popular fiction and  advertising from the early 20th century stress that a homemaker  must be lovely and serene as well as skilled and devoted  (Shapiro 1986, 25). \"Make your kitchen a beauty parlor for  pots and pans\" was the copy of a 1939 magazine advertizement  for SOS soap pads,3 and indeed, industrial exhibitors brought  the glamour, the indulgence, and the leisure of the beauty  parlor into the modern American kitchen, in their exhibits as  well as in their advertizing.   Two models for the kitchen of tomorrow were the Living  Kitchen designed for the America at Home exhibit by Allmon  Fordyce, and the Kitchen of the Electrified Farm. The Living  Kitchen was one of sixteen model interiors meant to display  modernity of design as well as function. Fordyce issued a  release indicating what the kitchen of the future would need to  be: The \"Living Kitchen\" is a room for the whole family to  live in. Fresh in its approach to the new needs of the  modern family, it combines the maximum comfort for daily  living and the greatest efficiency for cooking and  workspace. . . . The chief function of this kitchen is to  lighten the burden of work for the woman who is doing the  cooking and housekeeping in her own home and to provide an  opportunity for her to share the companionship of her  family and friends while she is working. . . . Less than  one per cent of the population employ servants. . . . By  sharing the room with friends, they are not \"slaves\" to  the job (NYPL box 363). By making the Living Kitchen open to the living and dining  rooms of the house, Fordyce assured women that what kitchen  work remained in the newly efficient facility was not dirty or  demeaning or low-class. On the contrary, making the  housewife's kitchen activities visible gave value to her  efficiency and attractiveness, rather than to her labor, so  much so that the kitchen became an extension of the living and  dining rooms--a place of sociability rather than burdensome  work. In her kitchen, the housewife could show herself  performing technology with perfect ease. In the kitchen at the Electrified Farm a woman prepared  food in a very large and well-equipped rural kitchen,  explaining all the steps of her work to spectators standing  outside the house and looking in the windows. A small  microphone around her neck broadcast her voice to the audience  outside, whom she did not \"see\" or acknowledge. The kitchen  exhibit, like the rest of the Electrified farm, used  naturalistic performances to show how modern electrical  equipment would be integrated into everyday life. It showed  how, in fact, Typical Americans would come into contact with  the World of Tomorrow.   The World of Tomorrow promised to change the domestic  space the housewife occupied by making her work easier and more  interesting. The average housewife would become a new kind of  Typical American, Mrs. 1939, whose presence in her kitchen  would be ornamental. Her performance would make her visible in  a way that would distinguish her tasks from those of servants,  who perform their work unseen (Barber 1940b). Time-saving  foods and labor-saving appliances having liberated her from the  drudgery of heavy kitchen work, she could create whimsical  conceits such as the sandwich loaf in the form of the frosted  cake, an emblem of how to consume industrial food, use up  surplus time, and create the visual effect of effort   Notes to part III  1. Gaige's particular interest was spices and herbs, and he  took the opportunity to include at the back of the New York  World's Fair Cookbook a section he called \"The spice shelf  today.\" Under sweet basil, for instance, Gaige wrote, \"A  little known flavor, it well rewards the experimenter.\" and  suggested using it with tomatoes. Andre Simon especially  praised the spice list in his review of the book and called it  a valuable reference (Simon 1939, 283). 2. The Electric Light and Power Company exhibition included  scenes from the bad old days of gaslight New York. While many  historians of the world's fair have noted in retrospect that  the credulous utopian enthusiasm for the future seems quaint,  it is no more quaint than a longing for an imagined past. 3. One place this advertisement appeared was Woman's Day.  April, 1940, 47.    Part IV The Typical American Table: Americanizing  Etiquette   In the World of Tomorrow, not only would architecture  become smooth and ovoid and kitchen equipment streamlined, but  outmoded coarse behavior would also be refined. Factory- prepared foods, modern electric equipment, and a typical  American diet were not to be enough for life in the World of  Tomorrow. Shoddy manners, uninformed by modern American  etiquette, lagged behind the times and also needed futurizing.  Social reformers of the first part of the century regarded the  Americanizing of table manners to be among the most important  adaptations new immigrants needed to make (Levenstein 1988  105).  The America at Home Pavilion opened in 1940, replacing the  focal exhibit of the Community Interests Zone, where Mrs.  Modern had built her house with a telephone. While in other  pavilions at the fair the future of manufacturing and  technology was on display, America at Home showed how that  technology would affect the future of the home, where many of  the new products and inventions exhibited elsewhere at the fair  would ultimately be put into practice. Not only did the  sixteen model interiors show what the inside of the typical  American home of the future might look like, but programs and  performances showed what appropriate behavior for everyday  activities might look like.   The America at Home pavilion was inaugurated with the \"All  American Dinner,\" prepared and served by Miss Edith Barber in  the Living Kitchen. The All American Dinner was followed by a  \"Cooking Quiz\" on the turntable stage which was at the center  of the America at Home pavilion. The menu for the All American  Dinner was:  Dunking Tray (Vegetables and shrimp with horseradish mayonnaise sauce) Fried Chicken Asparagus Hollandaise    Baked Potatoes Little Yeast Rolls Old-Fashioned Strawberry Shortcake Coffee All who attended received a complimentary menu with recipes.  At the \"Cooking Quiz\" after dinner, Miss Barber posed and  answered many \"controversial\" questions about the dinner menu,  among them the following:  Biscuit dough or cake batter for strawberry shortcake?  [The recipe indicated biscuit dough.] Must a man dress for dinner if a woman does? May bread be served at dinner? May coffee be served during the meal? The task of defining the role of the housewife of the  future also makes it necessary to define masculinity in the  World of Tomorrow. Must the husband of tomorrow dress for  dinner? No answer is given in the script, but the performances  at the America at Home pavilion indicate that he must.  Since the end of the nineteenth century, as American  society reacted to the absorption of large waves of immigrants,  women, and young women in particular, had been the targets of  the urban social reformers who sought to Americanize recent  immigrants with the refining influence of etiquette.  Frequently the immigrant communities themselves made the  connection between manners and Americanization (Joselit 1990,  41). Their daughters--and especially new brides--were the  targets of the improving exhibits and performances produced at  America at Home. Women, motivated to educate themselves, their  husbands and their children, were the vectors for new  information. In the fall of 1940, shortly before the fair was  to close, America at Home sponsored Bride's Day. On September  29, 1940, any bride who had married in 1940 and showed a  wedding certificate to prove it was granted free admission to  the fair--husbands still had to pay. Some of the furnishings  from the America at Home exhibit were awarded to brides as  prizes--at the end of the fair, exhibitors needed to dismantle  and dispose of their material. Other prizes were blankets,  scales, radios and cookbooks. As the Chicago Jewish Sentinel  proclaimed in 1935, a good cookbook is as indispensable to a  home as a bed (quoted in Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1990, 88). The highlight of the America at Home exhibit was the \"Live  Dinner Party,\" which was performed on the turntable stage twice  a day for a packed house of two hundred visitors. Helen  Sprackling produced the \"Live Dinner Party\" and acted as the  narrator. Two couples sat at an elegantly appointed table  eating a dinner served by a uniformed maid and conversed  comfortably as they rotated in front of their audience. A  narrator in a full-length evening gown stood off to the side  and called attention to the proper execution of dinner table  protocol. The narrator also pointed out the design of the  party. The tablecloth, the dishes, the maid's uniform, and the  hostess's dress were all blue and white. The woman guest's  dress was white and both the men were in dinner dress.  Sparkling emphasized that the performance could entertain and  edify, as well as reinforce the wife's leading role in matters  of decorum: The auditorium . . . is packed each day at both shows. . .  . The show has elicited some very pointed sighs of relief  from the women, who have been re-assured on certain  troubling points of etiquette (NYPL box 364). The costumes were the same for every performance and so was the  menu. Every meal began with Campbell's soup and every meal  ended with Jell-O, both major exhibitors at the fair. The four  diners at the \"Live Dinner Party\" ate Campbell's soup and  Jell-O twice a day in their tuxedoes whilst spinning around on  a turntable.1 Both the All American Dinner and the Live Dinner Party  presented, in their different ways, a vision for the future of  the American table. At the Live Dinner Party, diners performing  correct manners wore formal dress and ate processed foods,  while at the All American Dinner, diners wearing informal dress  and cooking their own food performed a menu related to  heritage. Both offered up a feminized version of the American  table where men, lagging behind American women in the sprint to  the future, would be refined by codified table manners and  gentler, more feminine foods. Both dinner performances were  finally performances of consumption. Proper deportment and  etiquette elevated the industrially produced food on exhibit at  the fair, and elevated the people who prepared and ate it. Enthusiastic attendance at both these model dinners would  seem to indicate that almost all of the fairgoers who came to  enjoy the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940 were striving to  become more typical. In the fifteen years since America had  severely restricted immigration the country had become more  introspective, and it was essential to American homemakers to  prove themselves as Europe was sliding into war. That hundreds  would pack the house to watch four people eating dinner  testifies to how very urgently, how very passionately,  Americans of 1940 wanted to do the right thing, the typical  thing, if only they knew what it was.    Note to Part IV  1. Another production of Sprackling's, a performance entitled  \"Bringing up Bridget\" about how a young housewife should train  her first maid, was not performed at the fair. Edith Barber's  other book published that year, Speaking of Servants, was not  on sale at America at Home along with the Edith Barber  Cookbook.     V Conclusion: The Future is not What it Used to Be  The flavors of the World of Tomorrow that industrial and  municipal exhibitors of the New York World's Fair of 1939-40  offered up to American consumers were flavors of a safe, clean  future where food, housework, domestic space, and even the  deportment of Americans themselves would be different, modern,  and better. Americans, in their cooking and eating, would  conform to the smooth lines of the fair's futuristic design  even as they conformed to one another in their efforts to  become \"typical.\"  The exhibits that valorized typicality frequently did so by  equating typicality with consumption of manufactured and  uniform goods--consumption of milk, of packaged food, and of  the many electrical appliances that would bring the kitchen up  to typical American standards. Marketing techniques appealed  to patriotism and conflated good citizenship with good  consumerism. Industrial manufacturers planned their exhibits to allow  potential consumers to look inside the manufacturing process  and see that there was nothing therein about which to be  alarmed. The spaces were vast and clean, all vessels were  transparent, and, in many cases, all the labor was carried out  by lovely young women. Food of the future as presented at the  fair would be more packaged, more processed, and more  synthetic. In 1939 many felt this was good news. Processed  and packaged food stood not for tastelessness but for safety  and hygiene. The fair's exhibits urged women in particular to steer the  way for their families in their electrified kitchens--kitchens  in which they would no longer be confined as in the old days,  but to which they would willingly return time and again, to  indulge in recreational cooking in-between their diverting and  self-improving activities. In these open and comfortable  kitchens, women of the future using factory prepared foods  could whip up impressive and decorative creations that  delighted guests and flattered the decorative cook herself. American housewives would also have the pleasure of serving  food to their families in a casually elegant atmosphere.  Uncouth behavior would be as out of place in the World of  Tomorrow as a washboard or crank's stove.  The world of tomorrow would be an America of the future  where automobiles would rule the roads, machinery would make  the lives of American workers safer and easier in the factory  and in the home. Cooking and eating in particular were to be  more streamlined and more hygienic as prepared foods and  futuristic equipment entered the American lifespace. Food  exhibits at the New York World's Fair 1939-1940 invited  visitors to throw off the outmoded prejudices of the past and  feast on the future.
