This program is  designed to foster entry into a neuroscience research-centered career.  Students apply for positions in a 10-week summer program during which they  actively participate in research projects in the laboratories of New York  University science faculty. We match students to laboratories primarily on  the basis of their background preparation and areas of interest. They work  either directly with faculty or with graduate students or postdoctoral  fellows. Each student conducts a research project under the direction  of his or her mentor. The students are involved in all phases of the  research process from experimental design to data analysis and communication  of results. At the end of the program, the students each give a presentation  of their own work at a summer research conference. The primary goal of this  program is to extend the Center's robust neuroscience research opportunities  to non-NYU students and to diversity the scientific workforce in the field  of Neuroscience. Financial support is available to non-NYU students through  the NSF REU-Site Grant. The First week of SURP will include a \"bootcamp\"  to accelerate the learning of lab skills specific to neural science.         The dates of the 2015 Summer Undergraduate Research Program are:  May 26 - July 31.   TO APPLY FOR SURP, PLEASE   CLICK HERE.
