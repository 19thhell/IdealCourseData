Truxes       The Master of Arts Program in World  History introduces students to the methods and approaches used by scholars to  study global and transnational history.    It also engages students in comparative and thematic work exploring the  history of at least two world regions.    This program is aimed at those who are seeking a historical perspective  on the increasingly interconnected global society in which we live. Among those whose needs may be served by the  MA in World History are educators, professionals involved in international occupations,  journalists or others working in the field of communications, and those  exploring their own interests through the study of global history. Acceptance into the World History MA Program  does not constitute admission into the Ph.D. program in the History Department  at New York University, but students intending to pursue a Ph.D. may later  apply for admission.      The core curriculum depends on the  student\u2019s choice of pursuing either the \u201cMA Essay Track\u201d or the \u201c Thesis  Track .\u201d The MA Essay track includes  eight one-semester courses (32 credit points), including three core courses,  three courses in a major field of study, and two courses in a minor field of  study.      The Masters Essay is a rewrite (a  developed and improved version) of a semester-length paper that has earned a  grade of \u2018A-\u2019 or above in one of the courses taken by a student in the World  History MA program. Students will submit their Masters Essays, together  with the original version of the paper (containing the grade and comments of  the course instructor) to the director of the World History MA program in the  semester before graduation. Students must present a master\u2019s essay, and they  must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language relevant to their  work.       The Thesis track includes eight  one-semester courses (32 credit points), including three core courses, two or  three courses in a major field of study, one or two courses in a minor field of  study, and a thesis course. Full-time  students wishing to write a thesis must declare their intention to do so by the  end of their first semester; part-time students must declare by the end of their second semester.  Students must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language relevant to  their work. Students may take cognate  courses in World History in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s program in  Humanities and Social Thought, and, with approval, up to two courses in  anthropology, sociology, politics, economics, or literature.      Students must undertake study of two  regions of the world, one of which will be designated as the major field and  one as the minor. The available regions are: Africa, East Asia, South Asia,  Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and North America.  Students must elect at least one field outside of Europe and North America.
