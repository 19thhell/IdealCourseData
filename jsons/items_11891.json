Rodwin and Simone Sandier      Prologue: The United States has traditionally looked to the   United Kingdom, its cultural parent, when studying alternative   social and political models. Health care is no exception. In the   early 1980s Canada's health care system as well came under American   scrutiny, and Germany's followed by the end of the decade. In this   paper authors Victor Rodwin and Simone Sandier turn their attention   to the less frequently studied model of France. \"The French health   system is a model no less worthy of study than the British, Canadian,   or German systems,\" they assert. Rodwin has suggested that \"formidable   linguistic and cultural barriers\" to date have discouraged widespread   study of the French system; yet this system is in many ways particularly   relevant for American consideration. Fee-for-service reimbursement, total   freedom of provider choice, an important private forprofit hospital   sector, and patient copayments exemplify a principle of \"liberalism\"   that some Americans find missing in the British and Canadian systems.   However, a principle of \"solidarity\" nourishes a national health   insurance system that provides nearly universal coverage, and stringent   government price controls keep price levels well below those of the   United States. The French public/private mix offers unique possibilities   for U.S. study - all the more so since outcome and performance indicators,   as well as public opinion on the health care system, are more favorable   than in the United States. Rodwin is director of the Office of International   Programs and associate professor of health policy and management at New York  University's (NYU's) Wagner School. He codesigned and directed   ( 1986-1991) NYU's Advanced Management Program for Clinicians.   Sandier is research director at the Centre de Recherche, d'Etudes   et de Documentation en Economie de la Sante (CREDES) in Paris. She   is an elected member of the (U.S.) Institute of Medicine.      Abstract: Several elements of the French health system - the   predominance of office-based medical practice, the mix of private   and public hospitals, the use of patient cost sharing, direct payment   of physicians by patients, and financing derived from payroll taxes - closely   resemble aspects of the U.S. health system. There are four major differences   between the two systems: the French system covers more than 99 percent of   the population; the prices of health services in France are lower than in   the United States; the volume of most services is higher than in the United   States; and French health care spending per capita is lower than in the   United States. Recently enacted and proposed reforms in France likely will   strengthen existing health spending targets and utilization controls.      French national health insurance provides universal coverage and high   levels of services to a population that is, on average, older than that   of the United States. 1 There are no queues for tertiary hospital services,  no \"patient dumping\" arising from financial barriers to care, and no public   complaints about rationing health care. What is more, France spends   9.1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care, compared   with 13.4 percent in the United States. 2 Despite these impressive features   of French national health insurance, there are also flaws. But the French   health system is a model no less worthy of study than the British, Canadian,   or German systems.      Several salient features of the French health care system - the dominance of   office-based private practice ( la medecine liberale ) for ambulatory care,   the mix of public and private hospitals, the widespread use of cost sharing,   the predominant practice of direct payment from patient to doctor, and the   reliance upon financing derived from payroll taxes - resemble elements of the   U.S. health system. These points of convergence make French national health   insurance especially relevant to Americans interested in learning from   abroad. This is all the more true given the current prospects for health   care reform and the interest in proposals for employer-financed national   health insurance.      Overview Of The French Health Care System      The French health care system is characterized by a powerful government   role in assuring universal coverage and regulating the health system,    la medecine liberale and cost sharing, and a public/private mix in both   the financing and the provision of services. These distinguishing   characteristics are grounded in three guiding principles: solidarity,   liberalism, and pluralism. 3 The commitment to universal coverage rests on   the principle of solidarity - the notion that there should be mutual aid and   cooperation between sick and well, active and inactive, and that health   insurance payroll taxes should be calculated on the basis of ability to   pay, not actuarial risk. In France, however, the commitment to universal   coverage goes beyond the financing of national health insurance and includes   the management of a national network of public hospitals, public health   programs, and a small number of publicly financed health centers.      The attachment to la medecine liberale and to cost sharing rests on   the principle of liberalism - the notion that there should be freedom   of choice for physicians and patients and some direct responsibility   for payment by patients. The enduring ideals behind la medecine liberale,   first formulated in 1928 by the principal physician trade union, specified   that physicians should be free to practice on a fee-for-service basis, that   patients should be free to choose their physicians (and vice versa), that   physicians should be assured clinical autonomy, that professional   confidentiality should be respected, and that there should be direct   payment between patients and doctors in private practice.      Finally, the public/private mix in the financing and provision of health   care in France rests on the principle of pluralism - the tolerance of some   organizational diversity, whether it be complementary, competitive, or both.  With respect to financing, pluralism justifies the coexistence of multiple   statutory health insurance schemes, complementary private health insurance   coverage, and significant cost sharing directly by patients. With respect   to the provision of health services, pluralism justifies the coexistence   of public and private hospitals and both office-based private practice and   public ambulatory care.      Medical care organization. The French have access to health services   ranging from those of general practitioners (GPs) in solo practice to   the most sophisticated high-technology procedures in public teaching   hospitals. In contrast to hospital services, where the public sector is   dominant, in ambulatory care - even more so than in the United States - health   services are organized around office-based fee-for-service practice.      Ambulatory care. In France there are more physicians than in the United   States, and they are less specialized (Exhibit 1). Although physicians in   general and family practice represent only 16 percent of all physicians   in office-based private practice in the United States, they make up 53   percent in France. 4 Nurses, physical therapists, speech therapists, and   a range of other professionals also contribute to the provision of   ambulatory care, mostly upon referral and mostly in private practice.   Also, in contrast to the United States, where many simple laboratory   tests are performed in a doctor's office, in France laboratory tests   ordered by all office-based private practitioners and many hospital-based   physicians are performed in independent laboratories. Pharmaceutical products   other than those intended for hospital patients are purchased almost exclusively   in private pharmacies whose locations and prices are regulated by the   Ministry of Health.      Ambulatory care also is provided in health centers located mostly in large   cities, where general practitioners and specialists work part time for  sessional fees. And, there is a network of centers for health checkups and   occupational health services in enterprises that oversee roughly ten million   salaried workers. 5 The French system of maternal and infant health services is   a noteworthy example. About 10 percent of all prenatal consultations are   provided through this public health program. But since French family allowances   for each new pregnancy ($150 a month) are contingent on seven prenatal examinations,   and payment begins in the fifth month of pregnancy, virtually all pregnant women   consult a general practitioner or an obstetrician, most often in private practice   (for 75 percent of the population) or in hospital-based outpatient consultations   (for 15 percent). 6         Exhibit I    Health Care Resources And Utilization, France And United States, 1989 - 1991      Resources   France     United States    Active physicians per thousand    2.67a   2.19b    Active physicians in private, office-based practice 1.89a   1.44b     General/family practice   52.9%     16.0%     Obstetricians, pediatricians, and internists     8.5   30.6     Other specialists   37.6     53.4    Total inpatient hospital beds    9.1a   4.9b    Short-stay hospital beds per thousand    5.1a 4.2 b     Public beds   62.7%     24.8%     Private beds   37.3     75.2      Proprietary beds as percent of private    68.3   13.4      Nonprofit beds as percent of private    31.7   90.8    Utilization    Physician visits per capita   8.3     5.5    Specialist visits per capita 3.4     3.85    Hospital days per capita  2.8     1.2    Short-stay hospital days per capita    1.4   0.8    Admission rate for all inpatient hospital services  23.1%   13.4%    Admission rate for short-stay hospital services     20.8%   12.4%c    Average length-of-stay for all inpatient hospital services (days) 12.3 8.3    Average length-of-stay in short-stay beds (days) 7.0 6.4c        Sources: French data are from ECO-SANTE France,   version 3 (Paris: CREDES, 1991); U.S. data are from Health, United States, 1991.    a 1991. b 1989. c 1991.   National Center for Health Statistics, National Hospital Discharge Survey,   Advance Data from Vital and Health Statistics (3 March 1993).           Hospital care. French public and private hospitals differ in mission,   technical level of medical services, patient clientele, mode of reimbursement   under national health insurance, and managerial autonomy. For example,   teaching and research are the domain of regional public hospitals (Centres   hospitaliers regionaux) that are affiliated with medical schools. Public   hospitals are obligated to accept all patients and to provide emergency care.   Although public and private hospitals serve a cross-section of the population,   the poor are more likely to receive care in public hospitals.      There are more hospital beds per capita in France (9.1 beds per thousand in   1991) than in the United States (4.9 per thousand). 7 In contrast to the   United States, where most short-stay hospital beds are in the private,   nonprofit sector, in France most short-stay hospital beds are in public   institutions; of the remaining beds in private hospitals, most are in   proprietary doctors' hospitals known as cliniques (Exhibit 1). 8      Public hospitals include general and specialized hospitals of variable   size, ranging from regional medical centers dedicated to medical education   and research, which have a virtual monopoly over highly specialized  \"tertiarylevel\" hospitals, to smaller local hospitals. All of these hospitals   are managed by boards of directors that include the mayor and other local   representatives. The director, however, is appointed by the Ministry of   Health in Paris, and appointment of all medical staff, as well as all   significant capital investments, are subject to strict ministerial supervision. 9      The private sector, with 37.3 percent of all short?stay hospital beds in   France, has half of all surgical beds, 28 percent of all psychiatric beds,   and 21 percent of all medical beds. The private, nonprofit sector has over   two-thirds of all private long-term care beds. Cliniques are typically smaller   than public hospitals, with an average of eighty beds. 10 Chniques have   traditionally emphasized elective surgery and obstetrics, leaving more   complex cases to the public sector. With less than 20 percent of all acute care   beds - public and private combined - the cliniques are responsible for 31 percent of   all admissions, of which one-half are for surgery and one-third are for   obstetrics. 11 However, over the past five years there have been a number   of mergers, and some cliniques have begun to develop a capacity for cardiac   surgery and radiation therapy. 12      In France the ratio of nonphysician personnel per bed is higher in   public hospitals (1.8) than in private hospitals (1.2) and, in the aggregate,   is 40 percent less than in U.S. hospitals (1.6 versus 2.7). 13 This striking   difference in hospital staffing may reflect a more technical and intense level   of service in U.S. hospitals. 14 But it largely reflects differences between a  national health insurance system and the U.S. system of health care organization   and financing, which is characterized by large numbers of administrative and   clerical personnel whose main tasks focus on billing multiple payers,   documenting all medical procedures performed, and handling risk management   and quality assurance activities - functions that are only seldom performed by  most French hospital personnel. 15      In summary, the numbers of physicians, hospital beds, and hospital personnel   are higher in France than in the United States. But the technical level appears   to be higher in the United States, where the proportion of specialists in   ambulatory care and the density of staffing in hospitals are higher than in France.      National health insurance. French national health insurance   expanded from an initial program enacted in 1928 to the Social Security   Ordinance of 1945, which covered salaried workers in industry and commerce   and called for universal coverage. The process of expansion, however,   took thirty years to complete. 16 National health insurance was progressively   broadened to include farmers in 1961, the self-employed in 1966-1970, and all   remaining uncovered groups in 1978. 17      In contrast to the United States, with its three principal public   health insurance programs (Medicare, Medicaid, and Civilian Health   and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, or CHAMPUS) and over a   thousand private insurers each following different underwriting, benefit,  and reimbursement policies, the French active population is covered by   statutory, occupation-based, national health insurance schemes that are   part of the social security system. 18 All dependents are automatically   covered, as are the unemployed and the retired. National health insurance   funds are organized into regional and local funds, all of which are, in French   administrative law, private organizations charged with the provision of a public   service. However, since their total annual expenditure exceeds that of the   government's budget, the funds are closely supervised by the Ministry of   Social Affairs as well as the Ministry of Finance and are therefore, in   practice, quasi-public organizations. Health insurance premiums (payroll   tax rates) are set by the government, as are the range of benefits, which   are, with minor exceptions, uniform across national health insurance schemes.   In addition, the central government oversees a process of national negotiations  between the three principal national health insurance funds and representatives   of health care providers. It thereby assures that all providers are subject to   uniform reimbursement policies irrespective of the schemes under which patients   are covered.      Eighty percent of the population - mostly salaried workers and their   dependents - are covered under the General National Health Insurance Scheme,   which is managed by the Caisse Nationale de l'Assurance Maladie des   Travailleurs Salaries (CNAMTS). Nine percent of the populationmostly   farmers, their salaried workers, and management and administrative personnel   in agriculture and their dependents - are covered by two health insurance schemes,   both managed by the Mutualite Sociale Agricole (MSA). 19 Six percent of the   population - the self-employed - are covered by a fourth scheme managed by the    Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie et Maternite des Travailleurs non-Salaries   des Professions non Agricoles (CANAM). The remaining 5 percent of the insured   population and their dependents - miners, railway workers, subway workers,   notaries public, the clergy, artists, and others - are covered under   eleven smaller schemes, all having their inherited and well-defended   entitlements.      French national health insurance provides financial coverage for   comprehensive services ranging from inpatient hospital care to outpatient   services, maternity care, prescription drugs (including homeopathic products),   thermal cures in spas, long-term care, cash benefits, and, to a lesser extent,   dental and vision care. However, there remain small differences in benefits among   occupational groups. The self-employed pay higher copayments for ambulatory care,   while some of the smaller schemes, such as those for railway workers and miners,    require lower copayments or provide services directly to their beneficiaries.    Smaller funds with older, higher-risk populations are subsidized by the    CNAMTS as well as by the government. 20      Benefits coverage and patient reimbursement. In France there are no   restrictions on provider choice - no preferred provider organizations (PPOs),   no gatekeeper functions for primary care physicians, and no limits on the   quantity of services covered under national health insurance. As a general   rule, French patients pay the full fees directly to health care providers and   subsequently obtain partial or more rarely full reimbursement from their health   insurance funds. 21 The amounts reimbursed to patients under French national   health insurance are calculated on the basis of negotiated rates minus a   copayment, depending on the kind of service. 22 Charges borne by the patient,   however, may differ from copayments. It is important to emphasize that close   to one-third of French physicians have opted to charge fees in excess of   the nationally negotiated charges. Also, there are exceptions to the rules   about both direct payment and copayments. 23      Health care financing. To finance benefits under French national health   insurance for the 80 percent of the population covered by the CNAMTS,   employers pay 12.8 percent of the wage bill, and employees pay 6.9 percent   of their full salary, bringing the total payroll tax for health insurance to 19.7  percent of all wages. 24      The funds raised by mandatory payroll taxes finance 74 percent of personal   health expenditures in France (Exhibit 2). The remainder is financed by the   central government, by patients'out-of-pocket payments, and by an elaborate   range of private insurance schemes offering complementary insurance coverage.   Eighty-four percent of the French population has private complementary   health insurance coverage provided by commercial or nonprofit (mutual   aid society) insurers. 25 Paradoxically, despite universal coverage in France,   although aggregate out-of-pocket payments are 16 percent in comparison with   23.3 percent in the United States, for specific categories such as hospital   and physician services, the percentage of out-of-pocket payments is actually   higher in France than in the United States (Exhibit 2). In contrast, for   prescription drugs, the share of out-of-pocket payments in the United States   far exceeds that in France.

Notes: Percentages do not always add to 100 since there are other minor   sources of funds (for example, philanthropic sources) that are not displayed   in the exhibit. \"Government\" includes state and local authorities; \"private   insurance\" includes mutuelles, which are private, not-for-profit insurers.   French out-of-pocket spending amounts include payments by private    complementary insurers amounting to 2.3 percent of total personal health    care expenditures, but the breakdown by type is not known. Thus, strictly    speaking, direct out-of-pocket payments more likely represent 16 percent    rather than 18.8 percent of total personal health care expenditures, while    private insurance finding is closer to 9 percent of total personal health    care expenditures.    a National health insurance.         Provider payment. French physicians and other health professionals   in private practice are paid directly by patients on a fee-for-service basis.   Cliniques are still reimbursed on the basis of nationally negotiated daily   fees and charges. 26 Public hospitals receive annual operating budgets, and   unit prices for prescription drugs are set by an interministerial commission.      Charges for services provided by health professionals - whether in   officebased private practice, in outpatient services of public   hospitals, or in private hospitals - are negotiated every year within   the framework of national agreements concluded between representatives   of the health professions and the three principal health insurance funds. 27   These agreements establish the terms of payment according to a fee schedule. 28   The process of updating the relative value scale (RVS) to account for new   procedures, changing technologies, and their effects on the costs of production   is also the result of negotiations among the health professions, the national  health insurance funds, and the government. The assignment of values (in   current prices) is the object of even more heated negotiations, which have   been at the center of the government's frustrated efforts to control the   growth of health care spending. Once negotiated, the charges must be   respected by all physicians, except for the one-third (sector 2 physicians)   who either have chosen or have earned the right to engage in extra-billing. 29      The payment of hospital care is different for private and public facilities.    Cliniques , as well as private nonprofit hospitals, are reimbursed directly by   the national health insurance funds on the basis of a negotiated daily  charge and a fee schedule for hospital-specific charges for such services as   the use of an operating room. The remaining balance - a 20 percent copayment for   the daily charge - is recovered directly by cliniques from patients. Physicians   in cliniques , as in private practice, typically bill their patients directly;   patients in turn are reimbursed according to the charges of the national fee   schedule.      Since 1985 public hospitals are paid for their operating expenditures in   monthly installments on the basis of prospectively set operating budgets.   30 The amount of the budget is set by the Ministry of Health. 31 It is paid,   however, by national health insurance funds in proportion to the number of   hospital bed days of their beneficiaries and, to a much smaller extent, by   income derived from daily charges and copayments. 32 All physicians in public   hospitals are compensated on the basis of salary payment and sessional fees. 33   In addition, for service chiefs, there is an option to engage in limited   private practice within the public hospital.      Prices for prescription drugs allowable for reimbursement are set by a   national commission that includes representatives from the Ministries of   Health, Finance, and Industry. The commission sets prices for specific   doses and unit packages, taking into account analogous drugs already on   the market. For truly innovative products, prices are set in relation to   the costs of production, including research costs and evaluation of   therapeutic value.      Health care services. Existing data - whether they come from surveys or are   byproducts of the administrative system - consistently indicate that the   French, in comparison to Americans, consult their doctors more often,   are admitted to the hospital more often, and purchase more prescription   drugs. Yet health expenditures per capita are lower in France, since the   average prices of physician services, prescription drugs, and hospital   services are significantly lower than in the United States.      Prices. Despite the difficulties of comparing prices for goods and services   that are not identical, there is much evidence that average prices of physician   services, hospital services, and prescription drugs are lower in France than   in the United States. 34 Since May 1992, for example, the average charges for  an office visit to a French GP and a specialist are $18 and $25, respectively,   in contrast to the average price of $42 for an office visit to an American   GP. 35 Comparison of physicians' incomes in the two countries gives further   supporting evidence that French medical prices are relatively low. In 1990   the average annual net income, before taxes, of French physicians in private   practice ($69,300) was 42 percent of the annual income of their U.S.   counterparts ($164,300). 36      While the average per them rate for community hospitals in the United   States in 1988 was estimated at $590, in France the average would be   closer to $172. 37 Likewise, despite the difficulties of making price   comparisons, one can estimate that French pharmaceutical prices - the   lowest in Europe - are, on average, 50 percent lower than American prices. 38      Utilization. As in the United States, in the course of a year 78   percent of the French consult a physician at least once, but the   number of physician visits per capita is significantly higher in France   (8.3) than in the United States (5.5). 39 The average number of hospital   days per capita is also higher in France than in the United States: 2.8   versus 1.2 in all hospitals and 1.4 versus 0.8 in short-stay hospitals.   This difference derives from the higher hospital admission rate in France   (23 percent) than in the United States (13.4 percent). The average   length-of-stay in acute care hospitals is only slightly higher in   France than in the United States (Exhibit 1). 40      Consumption disparities for pharmaceuticals are even wider. On average,   the French use twice as many drugs per capita as Americans do. French   physicians prescribe drugs more often (for 75 percent of their consultations)   than American physicians (60 percent) and order twice as many different   drug products per prescription (an average of 3.2 versus 1.8). 41       Expenditures. Despite their low average prices for medical goods and   services, the French spend more for their health care than most of their   European neighbors spend because they are high users of physician services,   hospitals, and prescription drugs. 42 Yet comparative analysis of health   expenditures among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development   (OECD) nations indicates that per capita spending on personal health care   in France ($1,650) was 43 percent less than that in the United States   ($2,867) in 1991. 43      Assessment Of The French Model      The French model of health care organization and national health   insurance has not spared French policymakers from needing to tackle   the problems faced by their American counterparts: cost control and   inequalities in health status and access to care. But in terms of basic   outcome and performance criteria, the French model appears strong compared   with the U.S. model.      Cost control. The slowdown in the general economy and the problems of   financing national health insurance and the rest of the social security   system during the late 1970s led the French government to impose stringent   measures to contain the rate of increase of health care costs. These measures   aimed to control the medium-term growth of national health insurance spending   by influencing the supply of as well as the demand for health services. Their   probable effects may be examined by analyzing the evolution of health   care spending between 1970 and 1990.      In contrast to U.S. experience, in France the average annual rate of  increase in health spending, deflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI),   declined over the past two decades (Exhibit 3). While the annual growth rate   in real health spending from 1970 to 1975 was 7.2 percent, it dropped to 4.0   percent from 1985 to 1990. The equivalent U.S. rate rose from 5.0 percent to   6.0 percent.      The most striking contrast in the rate of health spending increase between   France and the United States is the difference in the rates of medical-specific   inflation - the medical price index (MPI) deflated by the CPI (Exhibit 4). 44   The national agreements negotiated among representatives of the medical   profession, the national health insurance funds, and the government in 1980   and 1985 appear to have been effective in maintaining low medical prices.   The decrease in these rates in France from 1970 to 1985 and their low rate   of increase from 1985 to 1990 reveal the success of French national health   insurance in keeping professional charges, daily fees, and pharmaceutical   prices low.        When one examines the evolution of health expenditures deflated by the MPI   (the volume of health services), there is also clear evidence of deceleration   in France, although not as much as successive governments have attempted to   achieve (Exhibit 5). Despite the decelerating trend, the volume of health   services in France has increased at higher average rates than in the United   States and most other OECD countries. As for the success of cost control   policies pursued in France, it is difficult to attribute the deceleration    depicted in Exhibit 5 to the specific measures implemented because a slow but    certain deceleration in volume has been documented since 1950. 45              One noteworthy measure to control the volume of health services over the   long run was the imposition of a limit, since 1971, on the number of  medical students admitted to the second year of medical school. 46    The policy reflects the current climate of opinion that assumes that    there are too many physicians; however, it takes at least ten years for    such a policy to have any effect. Thus, while the number of physicians per   capita is increasing more slowly in the 1990s (1.5 percent per year) than   in the 1980s (3.2 percent per year), the limit has caused the number of   students admitted to the second year of medical school to decrease, which   may result in a physician shortage in the early years of the next century.      In the hospital sector there have been controls on construction and capital   expenditures since the passage of the Hospital Law in 1970, which established   hospital planning procedures and population-based service standards for the   acquisition of new medical technologies. The most recent Hospital Law,   passed in 1991, reinforces hospital planning and service standards to promote   regionalization and controls over hospital investments. 47 As for hospital   operating expenditures, since 1979 the government has reinforced its   traditional price controls on daily fees in public hospitals by imposing   a total expenditure ceiling for all public hospitals.      Over the past decade a number of measures have been undertaken to increase   patients' out-of-pocket payments. 48 It is not possible to assess whether   these measures actually contributed to restraining the use of medical care,   but there is no doubt that the share of patient out-of-pocket payments   (including private insurance premiums) in total personal health expenditures   rose from 15.6 percent in 1980 to 19.3 percent in 1991. 49      Beyond cost control measures aimed at influencing the supply of and demand   for health services, recent policy has aimed directly at extending the cap   on public hospital expenditures to private hospitals and ambulatory care. In   1992 national agreements were concluded with representatives of cliniques ,   laboratories, and nurses working in the private sector. These groups agreed   to work within a nationally set expenditure target. As for physicians, after   much handwringing and acrimonious debate, for the first time in the history   of their negotiations with the government and the national health insurance   funds, all three physician associations have accepted the principle of an   expenditure target, as well as national practice guidelines that have yet   to be defined.      Whether and how any of these agreements will actually be implemented remains   to be seen. The concept of an expenditure target itself is ambiguous for   physician services, for which patients' out-of-pocket payments already   finance 28.3 percent of health spending. Will the target apply to all   health spending with the risk of jeopardizing access to care by all   patients and restricting physicians' clinical autonomy, or will it apply   only to spending reimbursed under French national health insurance at the   risk of reducing the level of coverage and possibly increasing inequalities   in access to medical care? In addition to such conceptual issues, the   information required to identify physicians who provide inappropriate   services within the new expenditure targets is seriously deficient in France,   given the absence of reliable data on diagnoses and precise procedures performed.      Beyond these technical issues, formidable political obstacles stand in   the way of implementing cost control policies. Despite efforts to control   both demand for and supply of health services, French policymakers have   encountered powerful resistance from the health professions and the general   population. Some measures taken in the name of cost containment have been   retracted in response to political opposition. In 1986, for example, when   Health Minister Philippe Seguin imposed copayments for high-cost illnesses   that previously were exempt, the elderly were severely hit. This contributed   to the fall of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's government in 1988, and the   next government eliminated most of Seguin's measures.      Inequalities in health. Although French national health insurance has   effectively eliminated significant financial barriers to medical care   and despite universal coverage of the population, there remain wide   disparities among social classes in patterns of medical care use; the   distribution of health resources is also highly skewed in favor of urban   areas and well-to-do regions. Moreover, as in other systems in which health   outcome indicators have been compared with measures of socioeconomic status,   in France there are significant inequalities. 50      With regard to patterns of use, the most well-to-do and educated French   people rely more on office-based private practice, particularly the services    of specialists and dentists. The more disadvantaged groups, including laborers,    make greater use of GPs and public hospitals. From 1960 to 1980 these    disparities diminished, but since 1980 they have been exacerbated? 51    These disparities are matched by equally flagrant disparities in life    expectancy. For example, during 1980-1989 the life expectancy of an engineer    at age thirty-five (forty-five years) was higher by nine years (25 percent)    than that of a manual worker (35.8 years). 52 Of course, differences in life    expectancy reflect such factors as education, housing, and working    conditions and cannot be attributed solely to differential access to    medical care. But it is important to note that the medical system has been    unable to compensate for these and other inequalities.      Outcomes and performance criteria. On the basis of life expectancy and   infant mortality indicators, France comes out ahead of the United States   and relatively high in comparison to the rest of Europe. 53 A girl born in   France in 1991 could expect to live 81.1 years, in comparison to 79.1  years in the United States. 54 As for infant mortality, in 1991 there were 7.3   deaths for every thousand live births in France, in contrast to 8.9 per   thousand in the United States. 55 These indicators are hardly complete enough   to draw inferences on the relative health status of the French and American   populations because they do not account for other dimensions of health such   as functional autonomy and well-being. But they are the only  v, tcomparable data available. In terms of patient satisfaction,   although polls in France have found different results depending   on the nature of the questions posed, a 1990 comparative survey   suggests that France ranks high in comparison to the United States. 56   In the United States 60 percent of the population felt that fundamental   changes are needed; in France 42 percent of the population shared this   feeling. 57      Concluding Observations      There are two striking differences between the health systems in   France and in the United States: the universal coverage of the French   population under a national health insurance program, and the lower   level of per capita health spending in France despite higher outcome   and performance indicators. Over the past five years, however, French   policymakers have had less success than other nations - notably Britain,   Canada, and Germany - in containing their rising health care costs. Health   care prices have effectively been kept low, but the volume of services - whether   measured in physical quantities (use of services) or in health spending deflated   by the MPI - remains high in comparison with the United States. Nevertheless,   much like the Canadian experience, price controls in France have been stronger   than the volume response, which in no small part explains why health care   expenditures in France are lower than in the United States and have grown   more slowly over the past fifteen years. 58      The French consult their doctors more often than Americans do, are admitted   to the hospital more often, and purchase more prescription drugs. Despite   wide disparities among French social classes in mortality and in patterns   of medical care use, when judged on basic outcome measures (life expectancy   and infant mortality) and polls of consumer satisfaction, the French health   care system comes out ahead of the U.S. system.      French national health insurance allows for free choice of providers and   clinical autonomy of physicians even more so than in the United States.   French physicians are never asked to play gatekeeper functions and are   not subject to the kind of utilization review and quality assurance   bureaucracy that has transformed the working lives of American doctors.   But this freedom has at least two consequences. First, for patients, direct   payment for most ambulatory care, the growth of extra-billing, and out-of-pocket   payments amounting to almost one-fifth of personal health care expenditures   are the quid pro quo for universal national health insurance with no   restrictions on patient-demanded services. Second, in exchange for more   clinical autonomy than American providers now enjoy and a national health   insurance system with universal coverage, French physicians and other   providers have learned to live with lower prices and lower incomes than   their American counterparts receive.      Health care reform in France is likely to strengthen expenditure   targets and utilization controls. The Loi Teulade , passed 4 January   1993, calls for national practice guidelines and routine collection of   information on patient diagnoses and physicians' procedure codes. The rapid   growth of health spending and volume of services no doubt will continue to   put pressure on French government officials to tolerate sector 2 physicians   and rising copayments. Along with opportunities for the growth of cliniques ,    this will be justified in the name of liberalism and pluralism. On the    other hand, the French commitment to solidarity will surely constrain these    developments. It will keep prices low, keep limits on the percentage of sector    2 physicians, cap payroll tax rates for all national health insurance funds,    and assure uniform payment rates to providers across all funds.

As of I March 1992 the family allowance paid to all   pregnant women, known as Allocation Pour le Jeune Enfant (APJE), beginning    in the fifth month, was equal to Fr 891 per month. The contingent conditions    and spacing of the prenatal visits are strict, and failure to comply reduces    and sometimes eliminates the family allowance during pregnancy. Caisse Nationale    d'Allocations Familiales , Paris, 1992.      These figures obviously are not comparable. A large part of this   disparity may be explained by the fact that French hospitals, more so   than their U.S. counterparts, sometimes provide long-term care for the   elderly. But even if one compares only short-stay beds, there are still   more in France (5.1 per thousand) than in the United States (4.2 per thousand).   The U.S. data on beds are divided by the resident population of 248,239,000 in 1991.      Two-thirds of the private nonprofit beds are in institutions that   participate on a contractual basis in the public hospital service.      G. de Pouvourville and M.

Between 1985 and 1989 the rate of growth of high-technology   equipment - for example, scanners, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines,   and lithotriptors - has been higher in the proprietary sector than in public   hospitals. For example, the number of scanners tripled in cliniques and   increased by only 60 percent in the public sector. Between 1987 and 1989   lithotriptors in cliniques increased by 85 percent and MRI machines by 40   percent, whereas in the public sector they increased by 32 percent and 20   percent, respectively. Le Monde , 28 April 1992, 36,       OECD Health Data, 1991.      Some evidence in support of this thesis may be found in a comparison of   intensive care units in French and U.S. hospitals. For a patient group with   the same severity of illness, invasive monitoring was used less for French   than for U.S. patients. W. Knauss et al., \"A Comparison of Intensive Care in   the U.S.A. and France,\" The Lancet (18 September 1982):642-646.

Dumont, La securite sociale, toujours en chantier (Paris: Les   Editions Ouvrieres, 198 1 ).       In 1991, 99.4 percent of the French resident population was covered   under national health insurance, leaving 300,000 to 400,000 people without   coverage. These people are considered medically indigent and are cared   for in public facilities that are reimbursed from public funds. Dupeyroux,    Droit de la securite sociale       Social security in France comprises an assortment of quasi-autonomous   national funds ranging from pensions to workers'compensation, family benefits,   and health insurance.      For more detail on the MSA, see F. Mandersheid, Une aurre securite   sociale: La mutualite sociale agricole (Paris: L'Harmattan, 1991).       For example, the MSA covers only 20 percent of its budget from   payroll tax contributions of its employed beneficiaries. Forty percent   comes from the General National Health Insurance Scheme for so-called   demographic compensation. Another 10 percent is a direct subsidy from the   government budget, and the remainder is raised through other taxes (on   agricultural products), other contributions, and interest on capital.   These figures are from the Budget Annexe des Prestations Sociales Agricoles   (BAPSA), Departement Etudes Economiques et Financieres (MSA, 1993). Each of the   eleven smaller health insurance schemes benefits from demographic compensation,   all in the name of solidarity. For example, the payroll tax contributions   of the employed clergy covered 60 percent of their scheme's expenditures   in 1991; the remainder was transferred by the General National Health   Insurance Scheme. Figures are from Les Comptes de la Securite Sociale,   Commission des Comptes de la Securite Sociale (July 1992).       To be eligible for reimbursement under national health insurance,  medical goods and services must be registered on a national list of   prescription drugs, appliances, prostheses, and medical procedures.    Also, all services and procedures must be performed or prescribed by a    physician, and all providers must be certified health professionals,    medical facilities, or pharmacies.       The copayment in France is known as a ticket moderateur . Under the   General National Health Insurance Scheme, the copayment is 25 percent   for physician services, 35 percent for private nursing services and   laboratory tests, and typically 30 percent for prescription drugs.   Essential drugs are exempt from copayments, but the copayment is set   at 60 percent for so-called comfort drugs. Patients in public and   private hospitals typically are required to pay 20 percent of the per   them rates plus a daily fee (roughly $10) to cover meals. Patients in    cliniques also pay copayments for all physician services, procedures,   and laboratory tests.      Public hospitals, most cliniques , and health centers generally   are exceptions to the practice of direct payment from patients to   providers. Patients are exempted from copayments in the following cases:   (I) for major medical or surgical procedures, defined as being equal to or   exceeding the approximate severity of an appendectomy, coded as KC-50 in   the French RVS (as of January 1993, the value of KC was approximately Ft 13,   making the fee for KC-50 equal to approximately $125); (2) for maternity care   and medical care resulting from accidents at work; (3) for hospital stays    exceeding thirty days; and (4) for serious, debilitating, or chronic illness.    There are thirty illnesses for which all patients are exempt from copayments.   The so-called thirty-first illness includes any degenerative condition not    included among the thirty illnesses. The so-called thirty-second illness    refers to multiple conditions (comorbidities) that make patients severely    disabled. The exemption from copayments for the thirty-first and    thirty-second illnesses is granted only upon approval of physicians    working for health insurance funds, so-called medical controllers.       These rates have been in effect since January 1992. Similar rates   apply for the population of salaried agricultural workers and special   occupations with their own health insurance schemes. Farmers and the    self-employed are taxed largely on the basis of their declared incomes.    It is important to note that in addition to health insurance benefits, the   revenues raised under the General National Health Insurance Scheme cover    cash benefits (salary continuation) as well as subsidies to the MSA and    smaller health insurance funds with older, higher-risk beneficiaries    (see Note 20).       Complementary health insurance coverage is generally linked to   occupation. The most well-to-do tend to have the most complete coverage   as well as the most supplementary benefits. Of the 84 percent of the   population subscribing to complementary health insurance policies, 61   percent join mutual aid societies ( mutuelles ), 24 percent subscribe to   private commercial insurance, and 15 percent have a caisse de prevoyance.   A. Bocognano et al., Enquete sur La sante et la protection sociale en 1990:    Premiers resultats (Paris: CREDES, 1991).       The new agreement in 1991 among cliniques, the national health   insurance funds, and the government called for the use of case-mix   criteria as well as expenditure targets in the determination of future   per them rates. J.C. Stephan, Seminaire d'information de l'UHP (Paris:   Formamed, 1992).       The first national agreements with physicians date from 1960 and   differ according to region. Since 1971 the agreements have lasted an   average of five years. The negotiation process has most often been   acrimonious, complicated, and long, revealing the conflicts among the   government's objectives of cost containment, payers' concerns about access,   and the profession's attachment to autonomy and purchasing power. V. Rodwin,   H. Grable, and G. Thiel, \"Updating the Fee Schedule for Physician Reimbursement:   A Comparative Analysis of France, Germany, and Canada,\" Quality Assurance    and Utilization Review (February 1990): 16-24; and D. Wilsford, Doctors and    the State: The Politics of Health Care in France and the United States    (Durham, N.C.. and London: Duke University Press, 1991).       The French fee schedule classifies all procedures eligible for   reimbursement according to an RVS. The charge for each procedure is   calculated by multiplying its relative value by the negotiated rate   (conversion factor). Thus, for example, the charge for an appendectomy   or simple hernia operation, coded as KC-50, will be ten times the charge   for removal of an ingrown toenail, coded as KC-10. The French RVS is   known as the Nomenclature Generale des Acres Professionnels (NGAP),    originally written in 1930 by a physician trade union, the Confederation    des Syndicats Medicaux Franqais . Its procedures are classified around    so-called key letters: C signifies a consultation with a general practitioner;    Cs, a consultation with a specialist; and V, a home visit by a general    practitioner. B signifies laboratory tests; Z signifies radiological    procedures; K signifies diagnostic procedures; and KC signifies surgical    procedures. Since a letter followed by a coefficient usually corresponds to    many different procedures, it is impossible for fund administrators to know    exactly for what procedures they are paying.      Three groups of physicians have the right to engage in extra-billing:   (1) those who have opted out of the system (0.4 percent of physicians),   for whom the national health insurance funds will reimburse nothing to patients;   (2) those who before 1979 had earned the right to exceed negotiated charges due   to their status and prestige in the medical community (3.4 percent of physicians);   and (3) those who since 1980, in exchange for giving up certain health benefits    and tax write-offs, choose to join the so-called sector 2 and thereby earn the    right to exceed negotiated charges so long as they do so with \"tact and measure\"    (25.7 percent of physicians). See \"Le secteur liberal des professions de sante,   premiers resultats,\" Bloc note statistique 68 (Paris: CNAMTS, May 1993). An    increasing number of physicians have joined sector 2, particularly specialists   in large cities. Although tact and measure has never been defined, surveys    indicate that extra-billing represents approximately 10 percent of total   physician income and that the average extra charge is 50 percent above the    allowed fee. For example, in 1992, for an average charge of Fr 93.6 (for a     GP visit, patients paid an average fee of Fr 138.8 for GPs in sector 2),     patients were reimbursed 75 percent of 93.6 (Fr 70.2) and paid Fr 68.6     (138.8 minus 70.2) from complementary private insurance reimbursement     or out of pocket. Thus, the official rate of reimbursement for GP visits     under national health insurance (75 percent) is considerably higher than     the actual rate (49.4 percent). Patients who visit physicians in the     second and third categories are reimbursed the full amount of charges     less copayments, thus leaving them to finance the remainder themselves    from complementary insurance policies or out of pocket.       G. de Pouvourville, \"Hospital Reforms in France under a Socialist   Government,\" The Milbank Quarterly 64, no. 3 (1986): 392-413.      For the time being, this amount is calculated largely on the basis of   last year's budget, an analysis of hospital activities, and an allowable   rate of increase. Meanwhile, hospitals are collecting case-mix information   that eventually may be used in budget setting.      For outpatient consultations in public hospitals, the patient has   the option of advancing only the amount of the copayment, and the hospital   recovers the rest directly from the patient's health insurance fund.       The sessional fees are the basis of payment largely to part-time   physicians working in private practice - attaches - who have an affiliation   with specific service units in the public hospital to work a certain number   of half-day shifts, most often for outpatient consultations or procedures.   These physicians in France are the closest French equivalent to attending   physicians in private hospitals in the United States.       We have been using the term charges to indicate negotiated payment   rates for physician services. Physicians with the right to exceed these   charges may bill patients for their fees. Average physician prices therefore   are higher than charges as estimated in the following note. In converting   francs to dollars, throughout this paper we have used the rate of 5.5 francs   to the dollar.       The allowable charge for an office visit to a French general practitioner   is Fr 100; to a specialist, Fr 140. Even if one adds the charges for simple   laboratory tests, often performed in a doctor's office in the United States    but always referred to a private laboratory in France, the average French price   for a GP office visit is still at least 27 percent lower. The average charge    for GP services in 1991 was Fr 137. To this we add 20 percent for laboratory    services and 10 percent for extra-billing, bringing the figure to Fr 183,    or about $33.       The figure for the average annual income of U.S. physicians is from   the American Medical Association, as cited in The Washington Post , 21    May 1992. The average annual income of French physicians is Fr 381,200.    Differences in national income between France and the United States    explain only part of this disparity, since the ratio of average?   physician income to average per capita income in 1990 was 4.4 in    France and 7.9 in the United States. Data on per capita income    (GDP per capita) in adjusted U.S. dollar purchasing power parities    are from OECD Health Data: $18,219 for France; $21,400 for the United    States.       The average per them costs (including physicians' salaries) were Fr   1,023 ($186) in 1988 for all public community hospitals and Fr 638 for   private hospitals (not including physicians' salaries). Adding Simone   Sandier's estimate of Fr 170 for physicians' fees in private hospitals,   the equivalent per them costs would be Fr 808. The weighted average comes to $172.       CREDES, Paris.       U.S. data are from NCHS, Current Estimates from the National   Health Interview Survey , 1990, Vital and Health Statistics, Series 10,   no. 181 (Hyattsville, Md.: NCHS, December 1991). French GPs account for   59 percent of all visits to physicians, compared with 30 percent in the   United States. S.M. Schappert, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey:   1990 Summary , Advance Data from Vital and Health Statistics (Hyattsville,    Md.? NCHS, 30 April 1992). If U.S. physicians who specialize in internal    medicine are added, the proportion comes to 43.5. This suggests that the    French make only slightly fewer annual visits to specialists (3?4) than    Americans do (3?85). But home visits, which have practically disappeared    in the United States, account for 17 percent of all physician services in   France. In contrast, hospital outpatient consultations in France were only    5 percent of all physician visits, compared with 13 percent in the United    States (NCHS, Current Estimates from the National Health Interview Survey ).       U.S. data are from NCHS, National Hospital Discharge Survey , Advance   Data from Vital and Health Statistics (3 March 1993).       In France 48 percent of personal health expenditures goes to inpatient   hospital care, leaving 30 percent for ambulatory care and 21 percent for    medical goods - largely drugs (18 percent) - in contrast to 9.3 percent    for drugs in the United States.       OECD Health Data, 1991.      Ibid. The French figure is calculated in OECD purchasing power   parities. The cost difference is much greater than the disparity in GDP   per capita between France ($18,219) and the United States ($21,400) and   explains why French health care expenditures in 1991 were 9.1 percent of   GDP, compared with 13.4 percent in the United States. The GDP per capita   figures are calculated by dividing the GDP of each country by its population   and adjusting the French figure by purchasing power parities.       The MPI includes a market basket of goods and services in the health   sector. Hospital prices have increased far more than pharmaceutical prices   in both countries.       A. Mizrahi, A. Mizrahi, and S. Sandier, \"Le systeme de sante en   France de 1950 A 1989,\" Journal d'Economie Medicale 9, no. 8 (1991): 379-405.       This limit, known as a numerus clausus , has been progressively   lowered from 8,588 to 3,750 students, which now corresponds to 2.5   percent of physicians now in practice.       The new law's planning procedures, known as the carte sanitaire ,   suffer from the same problems as the old law: They are not linked to   reimbursement incentives under national health insurance. See V.G.    Rodwin, \"On the Separation of Health Planning and Provider Reimbursement:   The U.S. and France,\" Inquiry (Summer 1980:139-150.       Copayments were increased for laboratory procedures,   selected prescription drugs, and certain physical therapy services.   Also, the allowance of extra-billing by sector 2 physicians contributed   to decreasing health insurance coverage for expenditures on physician   services. In addition, some prescription drugs were eliminated from the   list of eligible drugs for reimbursement, and the daily $ 10 fee for   hospitals was imposed to cover a portion of food and lodging.       This is supported by the fact that national health insurance expenditures   increased at a lower rate than personal health care expenditures between 1980 and 1991.       V.G.

Rodwin and Simone Sandier      Prologue: The United States has traditionally looked to the   United Kingdom, its cultural parent, when studying alternative   social and political models. Health care is no exception. In the   early 1980s Canada's health care system as well came under American   scrutiny, and Germany's followed by the end of the decade. In this   paper authors Victor Rodwin and Simone Sandier turn their attention   to the less frequently studied model of France. \"The French health   system is a model no less worthy of study than the British, Canadian,   or German systems,\" they assert. Rodwin has suggested that \"formidable   linguistic and cultural barriers\" to date have discouraged widespread   study of the French system; yet this system is in many ways particularly   relevant for American consideration. Fee-for-service reimbursement, total   freedom of provider choice, an important private forprofit hospital   sector, and patient copayments exemplify a principle of \"liberalism\"   that some Americans find missing in the British and Canadian systems.   However, a principle of \"solidarity\" nourishes a national health   insurance system that provides nearly universal coverage, and stringent   government price controls keep price levels well below those of the   United States. The French public/private mix offers unique possibilities   for U.S. study - all the more so since outcome and performance indicators,   as well as public opinion on the health care system, are more favorable   than in the United States. Rodwin is director of the Office of International   Programs and associate professor of health policy and management at New York  University's (NYU's) Wagner School. He codesigned and directed   ( 1986-1991) NYU's Advanced Management Program for Clinicians.   Sandier is research director at the Centre de Recherche, d'Etudes   et de Documentation en Economie de la Sante (CREDES) in Paris. She   is an elected member of the (U.S.) Institute of Medicine.      Abstract: Several elements of the French health system - the   predominance of office-based medical practice, the mix of private   and public hospitals, the use of patient cost sharing, direct payment   of physicians by patients, and financing derived from payroll taxes - closely   resemble aspects of the U.S. health system. There are four major differences   between the two systems: the French system covers more than 99 percent of   the population; the prices of health services in France are lower than in   the United States; the volume of most services is higher than in the United   States; and French health care spending per capita is lower than in the   United States. Recently enacted and proposed reforms in France likely will   strengthen existing health spending targets and utilization controls.      French national health insurance provides universal coverage and high   levels of services to a population that is, on average, older than that   of the United States. 1 There are no queues for tertiary hospital services,  no \"patient dumping\" arising from financial barriers to care, and no public   complaints about rationing health care. What is more, France spends   9.1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care, compared   with 13.4 percent in the United States. 2 Despite these impressive features   of French national health insurance, there are also flaws. But the French   health system is a model no less worthy of study than the British, Canadian,   or German systems.      Several salient features of the French health care system - the dominance of   office-based private practice ( la medecine liberale ) for ambulatory care,   the mix of public and private hospitals, the widespread use of cost sharing,   the predominant practice of direct payment from patient to doctor, and the   reliance upon financing derived from payroll taxes - resemble elements of the   U.S. health system. These points of convergence make French national health   insurance especially relevant to Americans interested in learning from   abroad. This is all the more true given the current prospects for health   care reform and the interest in proposals for employer-financed national   health insurance.      Overview Of The French Health Care System      The French health care system is characterized by a powerful government   role in assuring universal coverage and regulating the health system,    la medecine liberale and cost sharing, and a public/private mix in both   the financing and the provision of services. These distinguishing   characteristics are grounded in three guiding principles: solidarity,   liberalism, and pluralism. 3 The commitment to universal coverage rests on   the principle of solidarity - the notion that there should be mutual aid and   cooperation between sick and well, active and inactive, and that health   insurance payroll taxes should be calculated on the basis of ability to   pay, not actuarial risk. In France, however, the commitment to universal   coverage goes beyond the financing of national health insurance and includes   the management of a national network of public hospitals, public health   programs, and a small number of publicly financed health centers.      The attachment to la medecine liberale and to cost sharing rests on   the principle of liberalism - the notion that there should be freedom   of choice for physicians and patients and some direct responsibility   for payment by patients. The enduring ideals behind la medecine liberale,   first formulated in 1928 by the principal physician trade union, specified   that physicians should be free to practice on a fee-for-service basis, that   patients should be free to choose their physicians (and vice versa), that   physicians should be assured clinical autonomy, that professional   confidentiality should be respected, and that there should be direct   payment between patients and doctors in private practice.      Finally, the public/private mix in the financing and provision of health   care in France rests on the principle of pluralism - the tolerance of some   organizational diversity, whether it be complementary, competitive, or both.  With respect to financing, pluralism justifies the coexistence of multiple   statutory health insurance schemes, complementary private health insurance   coverage, and significant cost sharing directly by patients. With respect   to the provision of health services, pluralism justifies the coexistence   of public and private hospitals and both office-based private practice and   public ambulatory care.      Medical care organization. The French have access to health services   ranging from those of general practitioners (GPs) in solo practice to   the most sophisticated high-technology procedures in public teaching   hospitals. In contrast to hospital services, where the public sector is   dominant, in ambulatory care - even more so than in the United States - health   services are organized around office-based fee-for-service practice.      Ambulatory care. In France there are more physicians than in the United   States, and they are less specialized (Exhibit 1). Although physicians in   general and family practice represent only 16 percent of all physicians   in office-based private practice in the United States, they make up 53   percent in France. 4 Nurses, physical therapists, speech therapists, and   a range of other professionals also contribute to the provision of   ambulatory care, mostly upon referral and mostly in private practice.   Also, in contrast to the United States, where many simple laboratory   tests are performed in a doctor's office, in France laboratory tests   ordered by all office-based private practitioners and many hospital-based   physicians are performed in independent laboratories. Pharmaceutical products   other than those intended for hospital patients are purchased almost exclusively   in private pharmacies whose locations and prices are regulated by the   Ministry of Health.      Ambulatory care also is provided in health centers located mostly in large   cities, where general practitioners and specialists work part time for  sessional fees. And, there is a network of centers for health checkups and   occupational health services in enterprises that oversee roughly ten million   salaried workers. 5 The French system of maternal and infant health services is   a noteworthy example. About 10 percent of all prenatal consultations are   provided through this public health program. But since French family allowances   for each new pregnancy ($150 a month) are contingent on seven prenatal examinations,   and payment begins in the fifth month of pregnancy, virtually all pregnant women   consult a general practitioner or an obstetrician, most often in private practice   (for 75 percent of the population) or in hospital-based outpatient consultations   (for 15 percent). 6         Exhibit I    Health Care Resources And Utilization, France And United States, 1989 - 1991      Resources   France     United States    Active physicians per thousand    2.67a   2.19b    Active physicians in private, office-based practice 1.89a   1.44b     General/family practice   52.9%     16.0%     Obstetricians, pediatricians, and internists     8.5   30.6     Other specialists   37.6     53.4    Total inpatient hospital beds    9.1a   4.9b    Short-stay hospital beds per thousand    5.1a 4.2 b     Public beds   62.7%     24.8%     Private beds   37.3     75.2      Proprietary beds as percent of private    68.3   13.4      Nonprofit beds as percent of private    31.7   90.8    Utilization    Physician visits per capita   8.3     5.5    Specialist visits per capita 3.4     3.85    Hospital days per capita  2.8     1.2    Short-stay hospital days per capita    1.4   0.8    Admission rate for all inpatient hospital services  23.1%   13.4%    Admission rate for short-stay hospital services     20.8%   12.4%c    Average length-of-stay for all inpatient hospital services (days) 12.3 8.3    Average length-of-stay in short-stay beds (days) 7.0 6.4c        Sources: French data are from ECO-SANTE France,   version 3 (Paris: CREDES, 1991); U.S. data are from Health, United States, 1991.    a 1991. b 1989. c 1991.   National Center for Health Statistics, National Hospital Discharge Survey,   Advance Data from Vital and Health Statistics (3 March 1993).           Hospital care. French public and private hospitals differ in mission,   technical level of medical services, patient clientele, mode of reimbursement   under national health insurance, and managerial autonomy. For example,   teaching and research are the domain of regional public hospitals (Centres   hospitaliers regionaux) that are affiliated with medical schools. Public   hospitals are obligated to accept all patients and to provide emergency care.   Although public and private hospitals serve a cross-section of the population,   the poor are more likely to receive care in public hospitals.      There are more hospital beds per capita in France (9.1 beds per thousand in   1991) than in the United States (4.9 per thousand). 7 In contrast to the   United States, where most short-stay hospital beds are in the private,   nonprofit sector, in France most short-stay hospital beds are in public   institutions; of the remaining beds in private hospitals, most are in   proprietary doctors' hospitals known as cliniques (Exhibit 1). 8      Public hospitals include general and specialized hospitals of variable   size, ranging from regional medical centers dedicated to medical education   and research, which have a virtual monopoly over highly specialized  \"tertiarylevel\" hospitals, to smaller local hospitals. All of these hospitals   are managed by boards of directors that include the mayor and other local   representatives. The director, however, is appointed by the Ministry of   Health in Paris, and appointment of all medical staff, as well as all   significant capital investments, are subject to strict ministerial supervision. 9      The private sector, with 37.3 percent of all short?stay hospital beds in   France, has half of all surgical beds, 28 percent of all psychiatric beds,   and 21 percent of all medical beds. The private, nonprofit sector has over   two-thirds of all private long-term care beds. Cliniques are typically smaller   than public hospitals, with an average of eighty beds. 10 Chniques have   traditionally emphasized elective surgery and obstetrics, leaving more   complex cases to the public sector. With less than 20 percent of all acute care   beds - public and private combined - the cliniques are responsible for 31 percent of   all admissions, of which one-half are for surgery and one-third are for   obstetrics. 11 However, over the past five years there have been a number   of mergers, and some cliniques have begun to develop a capacity for cardiac   surgery and radiation therapy. 12      In France the ratio of nonphysician personnel per bed is higher in   public hospitals (1.8) than in private hospitals (1.2) and, in the aggregate,   is 40 percent less than in U.S. hospitals (1.6 versus 2.7). 13 This striking   difference in hospital staffing may reflect a more technical and intense level   of service in U.S. hospitals. 14 But it largely reflects differences between a  national health insurance system and the U.S. system of health care organization   and financing, which is characterized by large numbers of administrative and   clerical personnel whose main tasks focus on billing multiple payers,   documenting all medical procedures performed, and handling risk management   and quality assurance activities - functions that are only seldom performed by  most French hospital personnel. 15      In summary, the numbers of physicians, hospital beds, and hospital personnel   are higher in France than in the United States. But the technical level appears   to be higher in the United States, where the proportion of specialists in   ambulatory care and the density of staffing in hospitals are higher than in France.      National health insurance. French national health insurance   expanded from an initial program enacted in 1928 to the Social Security   Ordinance of 1945, which covered salaried workers in industry and commerce   and called for universal coverage. The process of expansion, however,   took thirty years to complete. 16 National health insurance was progressively   broadened to include farmers in 1961, the self-employed in 1966-1970, and all   remaining uncovered groups in 1978. 17      In contrast to the United States, with its three principal public   health insurance programs (Medicare, Medicaid, and Civilian Health   and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, or CHAMPUS) and over a   thousand private insurers each following different underwriting, benefit,  and reimbursement policies, the French active population is covered by   statutory, occupation-based, national health insurance schemes that are   part of the social security system. 18 All dependents are automatically   covered, as are the unemployed and the retired. National health insurance   funds are organized into regional and local funds, all of which are, in French   administrative law, private organizations charged with the provision of a public   service. However, since their total annual expenditure exceeds that of the   government's budget, the funds are closely supervised by the Ministry of   Social Affairs as well as the Ministry of Finance and are therefore, in   practice, quasi-public organizations. Health insurance premiums (payroll   tax rates) are set by the government, as are the range of benefits, which   are, with minor exceptions, uniform across national health insurance schemes.   In addition, the central government oversees a process of national negotiations  between the three principal national health insurance funds and representatives   of health care providers. It thereby assures that all providers are subject to   uniform reimbursement policies irrespective of the schemes under which patients   are covered.      Eighty percent of the population - mostly salaried workers and their   dependents - are covered under the General National Health Insurance Scheme,   which is managed by the Caisse Nationale de l'Assurance Maladie des   Travailleurs Salaries (CNAMTS). Nine percent of the populationmostly   farmers, their salaried workers, and management and administrative personnel   in agriculture and their dependents - are covered by two health insurance schemes,   both managed by the Mutualite Sociale Agricole (MSA). 19 Six percent of the   population - the self-employed - are covered by a fourth scheme managed by the    Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie et Maternite des Travailleurs non-Salaries   des Professions non Agricoles (CANAM). The remaining 5 percent of the insured   population and their dependents - miners, railway workers, subway workers,   notaries public, the clergy, artists, and others - are covered under   eleven smaller schemes, all having their inherited and well-defended   entitlements.      French national health insurance provides financial coverage for   comprehensive services ranging from inpatient hospital care to outpatient   services, maternity care, prescription drugs (including homeopathic products),   thermal cures in spas, long-term care, cash benefits, and, to a lesser extent,   dental and vision care. However, there remain small differences in benefits among   occupational groups. The self-employed pay higher copayments for ambulatory care,   while some of the smaller schemes, such as those for railway workers and miners,    require lower copayments or provide services directly to their beneficiaries.    Smaller funds with older, higher-risk populations are subsidized by the    CNAMTS as well as by the government. 20      Benefits coverage and patient reimbursement. In France there are no   restrictions on provider choice - no preferred provider organizations (PPOs),   no gatekeeper functions for primary care physicians, and no limits on the   quantity of services covered under national health insurance. As a general   rule, French patients pay the full fees directly to health care providers and   subsequently obtain partial or more rarely full reimbursement from their health   insurance funds. 21 The amounts reimbursed to patients under French national   health insurance are calculated on the basis of negotiated rates minus a   copayment, depending on the kind of service. 22 Charges borne by the patient,   however, may differ from copayments. It is important to emphasize that close   to one-third of French physicians have opted to charge fees in excess of   the nationally negotiated charges. Also, there are exceptions to the rules   about both direct payment and copayments. 23      Health care financing. To finance benefits under French national health   insurance for the 80 percent of the population covered by the CNAMTS,   employers pay 12.8 percent of the wage bill, and employees pay 6.9 percent   of their full salary, bringing the total payroll tax for health insurance to 19.7  percent of all wages. 24      The funds raised by mandatory payroll taxes finance 74 percent of personal   health expenditures in France (Exhibit 2). The remainder is financed by the   central government, by patients'out-of-pocket payments, and by an elaborate   range of private insurance schemes offering complementary insurance coverage.   Eighty-four percent of the French population has private complementary   health insurance coverage provided by commercial or nonprofit (mutual   aid society) insurers. 25 Paradoxically, despite universal coverage in France,   although aggregate out-of-pocket payments are 16 percent in comparison with   23.3 percent in the United States, for specific categories such as hospital   and physician services, the percentage of out-of-pocket payments is actually   higher in France than in the United States (Exhibit 2). In contrast, for   prescription drugs, the share of out-of-pocket payments in the United States   far exceeds that in France.

Notes: Percentages do not always add to 100 since there are other minor   sources of funds (for example, philanthropic sources) that are not displayed   in the exhibit. \"Government\" includes state and local authorities; \"private   insurance\" includes mutuelles, which are private, not-for-profit insurers.   French out-of-pocket spending amounts include payments by private    complementary insurers amounting to 2.3 percent of total personal health    care expenditures, but the breakdown by type is not known. Thus, strictly    speaking, direct out-of-pocket payments more likely represent 16 percent    rather than 18.8 percent of total personal health care expenditures, while    private insurance finding is closer to 9 percent of total personal health    care expenditures.    a National health insurance.         Provider payment. French physicians and other health professionals   in private practice are paid directly by patients on a fee-for-service basis.   Cliniques are still reimbursed on the basis of nationally negotiated daily   fees and charges. 26 Public hospitals receive annual operating budgets, and   unit prices for prescription drugs are set by an interministerial commission.      Charges for services provided by health professionals - whether in   officebased private practice, in outpatient services of public   hospitals, or in private hospitals - are negotiated every year within   the framework of national agreements concluded between representatives   of the health professions and the three principal health insurance funds. 27   These agreements establish the terms of payment according to a fee schedule. 28   The process of updating the relative value scale (RVS) to account for new   procedures, changing technologies, and their effects on the costs of production   is also the result of negotiations among the health professions, the national  health insurance funds, and the government. The assignment of values (in   current prices) is the object of even more heated negotiations, which have   been at the center of the government's frustrated efforts to control the   growth of health care spending. Once negotiated, the charges must be   respected by all physicians, except for the one-third (sector 2 physicians)   who either have chosen or have earned the right to engage in extra-billing. 29      The payment of hospital care is different for private and public facilities.    Cliniques , as well as private nonprofit hospitals, are reimbursed directly by   the national health insurance funds on the basis of a negotiated daily  charge and a fee schedule for hospital-specific charges for such services as   the use of an operating room. The remaining balance - a 20 percent copayment for   the daily charge - is recovered directly by cliniques from patients. Physicians   in cliniques , as in private practice, typically bill their patients directly;   patients in turn are reimbursed according to the charges of the national fee   schedule.      Since 1985 public hospitals are paid for their operating expenditures in   monthly installments on the basis of prospectively set operating budgets.   30 The amount of the budget is set by the Ministry of Health. 31 It is paid,   however, by national health insurance funds in proportion to the number of   hospital bed days of their beneficiaries and, to a much smaller extent, by   income derived from daily charges and copayments. 32 All physicians in public   hospitals are compensated on the basis of salary payment and sessional fees. 33   In addition, for service chiefs, there is an option to engage in limited   private practice within the public hospital.      Prices for prescription drugs allowable for reimbursement are set by a   national commission that includes representatives from the Ministries of   Health, Finance, and Industry. The commission sets prices for specific   doses and unit packages, taking into account analogous drugs already on   the market. For truly innovative products, prices are set in relation to   the costs of production, including research costs and evaluation of   therapeutic value.      Health care services. Existing data - whether they come from surveys or are   byproducts of the administrative system - consistently indicate that the   French, in comparison to Americans, consult their doctors more often,   are admitted to the hospital more often, and purchase more prescription   drugs. Yet health expenditures per capita are lower in France, since the   average prices of physician services, prescription drugs, and hospital   services are significantly lower than in the United States.      Prices. Despite the difficulties of comparing prices for goods and services   that are not identical, there is much evidence that average prices of physician   services, hospital services, and prescription drugs are lower in France than   in the United States. 34 Since May 1992, for example, the average charges for  an office visit to a French GP and a specialist are $18 and $25, respectively,   in contrast to the average price of $42 for an office visit to an American   GP. 35 Comparison of physicians' incomes in the two countries gives further   supporting evidence that French medical prices are relatively low. In 1990   the average annual net income, before taxes, of French physicians in private   practice ($69,300) was 42 percent of the annual income of their U.S.   counterparts ($164,300). 36      While the average per them rate for community hospitals in the United   States in 1988 was estimated at $590, in France the average would be   closer to $172. 37 Likewise, despite the difficulties of making price   comparisons, one can estimate that French pharmaceutical prices - the   lowest in Europe - are, on average, 50 percent lower than American prices. 38      Utilization. As in the United States, in the course of a year 78   percent of the French consult a physician at least once, but the   number of physician visits per capita is significantly higher in France   (8.3) than in the United States (5.5). 39 The average number of hospital   days per capita is also higher in France than in the United States: 2.8   versus 1.2 in all hospitals and 1.4 versus 0.8 in short-stay hospitals.   This difference derives from the higher hospital admission rate in France   (23 percent) than in the United States (13.4 percent). The average   length-of-stay in acute care hospitals is only slightly higher in   France than in the United States (Exhibit 1). 40      Consumption disparities for pharmaceuticals are even wider. On average,   the French use twice as many drugs per capita as Americans do. French   physicians prescribe drugs more often (for 75 percent of their consultations)   than American physicians (60 percent) and order twice as many different   drug products per prescription (an average of 3.2 versus 1.8). 41       Expenditures. Despite their low average prices for medical goods and   services, the French spend more for their health care than most of their   European neighbors spend because they are high users of physician services,   hospitals, and prescription drugs. 42 Yet comparative analysis of health   expenditures among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development   (OECD) nations indicates that per capita spending on personal health care   in France ($1,650) was 43 percent less than that in the United States   ($2,867) in 1991. 43      Assessment Of The French Model      The French model of health care organization and national health   insurance has not spared French policymakers from needing to tackle   the problems faced by their American counterparts: cost control and   inequalities in health status and access to care. But in terms of basic   outcome and performance criteria, the French model appears strong compared   with the U.S. model.      Cost control. The slowdown in the general economy and the problems of   financing national health insurance and the rest of the social security   system during the late 1970s led the French government to impose stringent   measures to contain the rate of increase of health care costs. These measures   aimed to control the medium-term growth of national health insurance spending   by influencing the supply of as well as the demand for health services. Their   probable effects may be examined by analyzing the evolution of health   care spending between 1970 and 1990.      In contrast to U.S. experience, in France the average annual rate of  increase in health spending, deflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI),   declined over the past two decades (Exhibit 3). While the annual growth rate   in real health spending from 1970 to 1975 was 7.2 percent, it dropped to 4.0   percent from 1985 to 1990. The equivalent U.S. rate rose from 5.0 percent to   6.0 percent.      The most striking contrast in the rate of health spending increase between   France and the United States is the difference in the rates of medical-specific   inflation - the medical price index (MPI) deflated by the CPI (Exhibit 4). 44   The national agreements negotiated among representatives of the medical   profession, the national health insurance funds, and the government in 1980   and 1985 appear to have been effective in maintaining low medical prices.   The decrease in these rates in France from 1970 to 1985 and their low rate   of increase from 1985 to 1990 reveal the success of French national health   insurance in keeping professional charges, daily fees, and pharmaceutical   prices low.        When one examines the evolution of health expenditures deflated by the MPI   (the volume of health services), there is also clear evidence of deceleration   in France, although not as much as successive governments have attempted to   achieve (Exhibit 5). Despite the decelerating trend, the volume of health   services in France has increased at higher average rates than in the United   States and most other OECD countries. As for the success of cost control   policies pursued in France, it is difficult to attribute the deceleration    depicted in Exhibit 5 to the specific measures implemented because a slow but    certain deceleration in volume has been documented since 1950. 45              One noteworthy measure to control the volume of health services over the   long run was the imposition of a limit, since 1971, on the number of  medical students admitted to the second year of medical school. 46    The policy reflects the current climate of opinion that assumes that    there are too many physicians; however, it takes at least ten years for    such a policy to have any effect. Thus, while the number of physicians per   capita is increasing more slowly in the 1990s (1.5 percent per year) than   in the 1980s (3.2 percent per year), the limit has caused the number of   students admitted to the second year of medical school to decrease, which   may result in a physician shortage in the early years of the next century.      In the hospital sector there have been controls on construction and capital   expenditures since the passage of the Hospital Law in 1970, which established   hospital planning procedures and population-based service standards for the   acquisition of new medical technologies. The most recent Hospital Law,   passed in 1991, reinforces hospital planning and service standards to promote   regionalization and controls over hospital investments. 47 As for hospital   operating expenditures, since 1979 the government has reinforced its   traditional price controls on daily fees in public hospitals by imposing   a total expenditure ceiling for all public hospitals.      Over the past decade a number of measures have been undertaken to increase   patients' out-of-pocket payments. 48 It is not possible to assess whether   these measures actually contributed to restraining the use of medical care,   but there is no doubt that the share of patient out-of-pocket payments   (including private insurance premiums) in total personal health expenditures   rose from 15.6 percent in 1980 to 19.3 percent in 1991. 49      Beyond cost control measures aimed at influencing the supply of and demand   for health services, recent policy has aimed directly at extending the cap   on public hospital expenditures to private hospitals and ambulatory care. In   1992 national agreements were concluded with representatives of cliniques ,   laboratories, and nurses working in the private sector. These groups agreed   to work within a nationally set expenditure target. As for physicians, after   much handwringing and acrimonious debate, for the first time in the history   of their negotiations with the government and the national health insurance   funds, all three physician associations have accepted the principle of an   expenditure target, as well as national practice guidelines that have yet   to be defined.      Whether and how any of these agreements will actually be implemented remains   to be seen. The concept of an expenditure target itself is ambiguous for   physician services, for which patients' out-of-pocket payments already   finance 28.3 percent of health spending. Will the target apply to all   health spending with the risk of jeopardizing access to care by all   patients and restricting physicians' clinical autonomy, or will it apply   only to spending reimbursed under French national health insurance at the   risk of reducing the level of coverage and possibly increasing inequalities   in access to medical care? In addition to such conceptual issues, the   information required to identify physicians who provide inappropriate   services within the new expenditure targets is seriously deficient in France,   given the absence of reliable data on diagnoses and precise procedures performed.      Beyond these technical issues, formidable political obstacles stand in   the way of implementing cost control policies. Despite efforts to control   both demand for and supply of health services, French policymakers have   encountered powerful resistance from the health professions and the general   population. Some measures taken in the name of cost containment have been   retracted in response to political opposition. In 1986, for example, when   Health Minister Philippe Seguin imposed copayments for high-cost illnesses   that previously were exempt, the elderly were severely hit. This contributed   to the fall of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's government in 1988, and the   next government eliminated most of Seguin's measures.      Inequalities in health. Although French national health insurance has   effectively eliminated significant financial barriers to medical care   and despite universal coverage of the population, there remain wide   disparities among social classes in patterns of medical care use; the   distribution of health resources is also highly skewed in favor of urban   areas and well-to-do regions. Moreover, as in other systems in which health   outcome indicators have been compared with measures of socioeconomic status,   in France there are significant inequalities. 50      With regard to patterns of use, the most well-to-do and educated French   people rely more on office-based private practice, particularly the services    of specialists and dentists. The more disadvantaged groups, including laborers,    make greater use of GPs and public hospitals. From 1960 to 1980 these    disparities diminished, but since 1980 they have been exacerbated? 51    These disparities are matched by equally flagrant disparities in life    expectancy. For example, during 1980-1989 the life expectancy of an engineer    at age thirty-five (forty-five years) was higher by nine years (25 percent)    than that of a manual worker (35.8 years). 52 Of course, differences in life    expectancy reflect such factors as education, housing, and working    conditions and cannot be attributed solely to differential access to    medical care. But it is important to note that the medical system has been    unable to compensate for these and other inequalities.      Outcomes and performance criteria. On the basis of life expectancy and   infant mortality indicators, France comes out ahead of the United States   and relatively high in comparison to the rest of Europe. 53 A girl born in   France in 1991 could expect to live 81.1 years, in comparison to 79.1  years in the United States. 54 As for infant mortality, in 1991 there were 7.3   deaths for every thousand live births in France, in contrast to 8.9 per   thousand in the United States. 55 These indicators are hardly complete enough   to draw inferences on the relative health status of the French and American   populations because they do not account for other dimensions of health such   as functional autonomy and well-being. But they are the only  v, tcomparable data available. In terms of patient satisfaction,   although polls in France have found different results depending   on the nature of the questions posed, a 1990 comparative survey   suggests that France ranks high in comparison to the United States. 56   In the United States 60 percent of the population felt that fundamental   changes are needed; in France 42 percent of the population shared this   feeling. 57      Concluding Observations      There are two striking differences between the health systems in   France and in the United States: the universal coverage of the French   population under a national health insurance program, and the lower   level of per capita health spending in France despite higher outcome   and performance indicators. Over the past five years, however, French   policymakers have had less success than other nations - notably Britain,   Canada, and Germany - in containing their rising health care costs. Health   care prices have effectively been kept low, but the volume of services - whether   measured in physical quantities (use of services) or in health spending deflated   by the MPI - remains high in comparison with the United States. Nevertheless,   much like the Canadian experience, price controls in France have been stronger   than the volume response, which in no small part explains why health care   expenditures in France are lower than in the United States and have grown   more slowly over the past fifteen years. 58      The French consult their doctors more often than Americans do, are admitted   to the hospital more often, and purchase more prescription drugs. Despite   wide disparities among French social classes in mortality and in patterns   of medical care use, when judged on basic outcome measures (life expectancy   and infant mortality) and polls of consumer satisfaction, the French health   care system comes out ahead of the U.S. system.      French national health insurance allows for free choice of providers and   clinical autonomy of physicians even more so than in the United States.   French physicians are never asked to play gatekeeper functions and are   not subject to the kind of utilization review and quality assurance   bureaucracy that has transformed the working lives of American doctors.   But this freedom has at least two consequences. First, for patients, direct   payment for most ambulatory care, the growth of extra-billing, and out-of-pocket   payments amounting to almost one-fifth of personal health care expenditures   are the quid pro quo for universal national health insurance with no   restrictions on patient-demanded services. Second, in exchange for more   clinical autonomy than American providers now enjoy and a national health   insurance system with universal coverage, French physicians and other   providers have learned to live with lower prices and lower incomes than   their American counterparts receive.      Health care reform in France is likely to strengthen expenditure   targets and utilization controls. The Loi Teulade , passed 4 January   1993, calls for national practice guidelines and routine collection of   information on patient diagnoses and physicians' procedure codes. The rapid   growth of health spending and volume of services no doubt will continue to   put pressure on French government officials to tolerate sector 2 physicians   and rising copayments. Along with opportunities for the growth of cliniques ,    this will be justified in the name of liberalism and pluralism. On the    other hand, the French commitment to solidarity will surely constrain these    developments. It will keep prices low, keep limits on the percentage of sector    2 physicians, cap payroll tax rates for all national health insurance funds,    and assure uniform payment rates to providers across all funds.

Caisse Nationale    d'Allocations Familiales , Paris, 1992.      These figures obviously are not comparable. A large part of this   disparity may be explained by the fact that French hospitals, more so   than their U.S. counterparts, sometimes provide long-term care for the   elderly. But even if one compares only short-stay beds, there are still   more in France (5.1 per thousand) than in the United States (4.2 per thousand).   The U.S. data on beds are divided by the resident population of 248,239,000 in 1991.      Two-thirds of the private nonprofit beds are in institutions that   participate on a contractual basis in the public hospital service.      G. de Pouvourville and M.

Between 1985 and 1989 the rate of growth of high-technology   equipment - for example, scanners, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines,   and lithotriptors - has been higher in the proprietary sector than in public   hospitals. For example, the number of scanners tripled in cliniques and   increased by only 60 percent in the public sector. Between 1987 and 1989   lithotriptors in cliniques increased by 85 percent and MRI machines by 40   percent, whereas in the public sector they increased by 32 percent and 20   percent, respectively. Le Monde , 28 April 1992, 36,       OECD Health Data, 1991.      Some evidence in support of this thesis may be found in a comparison of   intensive care units in French and U.S. hospitals. For a patient group with   the same severity of illness, invasive monitoring was used less for French   than for U.S. patients. W. Knauss et al., \"A Comparison of Intensive Care in   the U.S.A. and France,\" The Lancet (18 September 1982):642-646.

Dumont, La securite sociale, toujours en chantier (Paris: Les   Editions Ouvrieres, 198 1 ).       In 1991, 99.4 percent of the French resident population was covered   under national health insurance, leaving 300,000 to 400,000 people without   coverage. These people are considered medically indigent and are cared   for in public facilities that are reimbursed from public funds. Dupeyroux,    Droit de la securite sociale       Social security in France comprises an assortment of quasi-autonomous   national funds ranging from pensions to workers'compensation, family benefits,   and health insurance.      For more detail on the MSA, see F. Mandersheid, Une aurre securite   sociale: La mutualite sociale agricole (Paris: L'Harmattan, 1991).       For example, the MSA covers only 20 percent of its budget from   payroll tax contributions of its employed beneficiaries. Forty percent   comes from the General National Health Insurance Scheme for so-called   demographic compensation. Another 10 percent is a direct subsidy from the   government budget, and the remainder is raised through other taxes (on   agricultural products), other contributions, and interest on capital.   These figures are from the Budget Annexe des Prestations Sociales Agricoles   (BAPSA), Departement Etudes Economiques et Financieres (MSA, 1993). Each of the   eleven smaller health insurance schemes benefits from demographic compensation,   all in the name of solidarity. For example, the payroll tax contributions   of the employed clergy covered 60 percent of their scheme's expenditures   in 1991; the remainder was transferred by the General National Health   Insurance Scheme. Figures are from Les Comptes de la Securite Sociale,   Commission des Comptes de la Securite Sociale (July 1992).       To be eligible for reimbursement under national health insurance,  medical goods and services must be registered on a national list of   prescription drugs, appliances, prostheses, and medical procedures.    Also, all services and procedures must be performed or prescribed by a    physician, and all providers must be certified health professionals,    medical facilities, or pharmacies.       The copayment in France is known as a ticket moderateur . Under the   General National Health Insurance Scheme, the copayment is 25 percent   for physician services, 35 percent for private nursing services and   laboratory tests, and typically 30 percent for prescription drugs.   Essential drugs are exempt from copayments, but the copayment is set   at 60 percent for so-called comfort drugs. Patients in public and   private hospitals typically are required to pay 20 percent of the per   them rates plus a daily fee (roughly $10) to cover meals. Patients in    cliniques also pay copayments for all physician services, procedures,   and laboratory tests.      Public hospitals, most cliniques , and health centers generally   are exceptions to the practice of direct payment from patients to   providers. Patients are exempted from copayments in the following cases:   (I) for major medical or surgical procedures, defined as being equal to or   exceeding the approximate severity of an appendectomy, coded as KC-50 in   the French RVS (as of January 1993, the value of KC was approximately Ft 13,   making the fee for KC-50 equal to approximately $125); (2) for maternity care   and medical care resulting from accidents at work; (3) for hospital stays    exceeding thirty days; and (4) for serious, debilitating, or chronic illness.    There are thirty illnesses for which all patients are exempt from copayments.   The so-called thirty-first illness includes any degenerative condition not    included among the thirty illnesses. The so-called thirty-second illness    refers to multiple conditions (comorbidities) that make patients severely    disabled. The exemption from copayments for the thirty-first and    thirty-second illnesses is granted only upon approval of physicians    working for health insurance funds, so-called medical controllers.       These rates have been in effect since January 1992. Similar rates   apply for the population of salaried agricultural workers and special   occupations with their own health insurance schemes. Farmers and the    self-employed are taxed largely on the basis of their declared incomes.    It is important to note that in addition to health insurance benefits, the   revenues raised under the General National Health Insurance Scheme cover    cash benefits (salary continuation) as well as subsidies to the MSA and    smaller health insurance funds with older, higher-risk beneficiaries    (see Note 20).       Complementary health insurance coverage is generally linked to   occupation. The most well-to-do tend to have the most complete coverage   as well as the most supplementary benefits. Of the 84 percent of the   population subscribing to complementary health insurance policies, 61   percent join mutual aid societies ( mutuelles ), 24 percent subscribe to   private commercial insurance, and 15 percent have a caisse de prevoyance.   A. Bocognano et al., Enquete sur La sante et la protection sociale en 1990:    Premiers resultats (Paris: CREDES, 1991).       The new agreement in 1991 among cliniques, the national health   insurance funds, and the government called for the use of case-mix   criteria as well as expenditure targets in the determination of future   per them rates. J.C. Stephan, Seminaire d'information de l'UHP (Paris:   Formamed, 1992).       The first national agreements with physicians date from 1960 and   differ according to region. Since 1971 the agreements have lasted an   average of five years. The negotiation process has most often been   acrimonious, complicated, and long, revealing the conflicts among the   government's objectives of cost containment, payers' concerns about access,   and the profession's attachment to autonomy and purchasing power. V. Rodwin,   H. Grable, and G. Thiel, \"Updating the Fee Schedule for Physician Reimbursement:   A Comparative Analysis of France, Germany, and Canada,\" Quality Assurance    and Utilization Review (February 1990): 16-24; and D. Wilsford, Doctors and    the State: The Politics of Health Care in France and the United States    (Durham, N.C.. and London: Duke University Press, 1991).       The French fee schedule classifies all procedures eligible for   reimbursement according to an RVS. The charge for each procedure is   calculated by multiplying its relative value by the negotiated rate   (conversion factor). Thus, for example, the charge for an appendectomy   or simple hernia operation, coded as KC-50, will be ten times the charge   for removal of an ingrown toenail, coded as KC-10. The French RVS is   known as the Nomenclature Generale des Acres Professionnels (NGAP),    originally written in 1930 by a physician trade union, the Confederation    des Syndicats Medicaux Franqais . Its procedures are classified around    so-called key letters: C signifies a consultation with a general practitioner;    Cs, a consultation with a specialist; and V, a home visit by a general    practitioner. B signifies laboratory tests; Z signifies radiological    procedures; K signifies diagnostic procedures; and KC signifies surgical    procedures. Since a letter followed by a coefficient usually corresponds to    many different procedures, it is impossible for fund administrators to know    exactly for what procedures they are paying.      Three groups of physicians have the right to engage in extra-billing:   (1) those who have opted out of the system (0.4 percent of physicians),   for whom the national health insurance funds will reimburse nothing to patients;   (2) those who before 1979 had earned the right to exceed negotiated charges due   to their status and prestige in the medical community (3.4 percent of physicians);   and (3) those who since 1980, in exchange for giving up certain health benefits    and tax write-offs, choose to join the so-called sector 2 and thereby earn the    right to exceed negotiated charges so long as they do so with \"tact and measure\"    (25.7 percent of physicians). See \"Le secteur liberal des professions de sante,   premiers resultats,\" Bloc note statistique 68 (Paris: CNAMTS, May 1993). An    increasing number of physicians have joined sector 2, particularly specialists   in large cities. Although tact and measure has never been defined, surveys    indicate that extra-billing represents approximately 10 percent of total   physician income and that the average extra charge is 50 percent above the    allowed fee. For example, in 1992, for an average charge of Fr 93.6 (for a     GP visit, patients paid an average fee of Fr 138.8 for GPs in sector 2),     patients were reimbursed 75 percent of 93.6 (Fr 70.2) and paid Fr 68.6     (138.8 minus 70.2) from complementary private insurance reimbursement     or out of pocket. Thus, the official rate of reimbursement for GP visits     under national health insurance (75 percent) is considerably higher than     the actual rate (49.4 percent). Patients who visit physicians in the     second and third categories are reimbursed the full amount of charges     less copayments, thus leaving them to finance the remainder themselves    from complementary insurance policies or out of pocket.       G. de Pouvourville, \"Hospital Reforms in France under a Socialist   Government,\" The Milbank Quarterly 64, no. 3 (1986): 392-413.      For the time being, this amount is calculated largely on the basis of   last year's budget, an analysis of hospital activities, and an allowable   rate of increase. Meanwhile, hospitals are collecting case-mix information   that eventually may be used in budget setting.      For outpatient consultations in public hospitals, the patient has   the option of advancing only the amount of the copayment, and the hospital   recovers the rest directly from the patient's health insurance fund.       The sessional fees are the basis of payment largely to part-time   physicians working in private practice - attaches - who have an affiliation   with specific service units in the public hospital to work a certain number   of half-day shifts, most often for outpatient consultations or procedures.   These physicians in France are the closest French equivalent to attending   physicians in private hospitals in the United States.       We have been using the term charges to indicate negotiated payment   rates for physician services. Physicians with the right to exceed these   charges may bill patients for their fees. Average physician prices therefore   are higher than charges as estimated in the following note. In converting   francs to dollars, throughout this paper we have used the rate of 5.5 francs   to the dollar.       The allowable charge for an office visit to a French general practitioner   is Fr 100; to a specialist, Fr 140. Even if one adds the charges for simple   laboratory tests, often performed in a doctor's office in the United States    but always referred to a private laboratory in France, the average French price   for a GP office visit is still at least 27 percent lower. The average charge    for GP services in 1991 was Fr 137. To this we add 20 percent for laboratory    services and 10 percent for extra-billing, bringing the figure to Fr 183,    or about $33.       The figure for the average annual income of U.S. physicians is from   the American Medical Association, as cited in The Washington Post , 21    May 1992. The average annual income of French physicians is Fr 381,200.    Differences in national income between France and the United States    explain only part of this disparity, since the ratio of average?   physician income to average per capita income in 1990 was 4.4 in    France and 7.9 in the United States. Data on per capita income    (GDP per capita) in adjusted U.S. dollar purchasing power parities    are from OECD Health Data: $18,219 for France; $21,400 for the United    States.       The average per them costs (including physicians' salaries) were Fr   1,023 ($186) in 1988 for all public community hospitals and Fr 638 for   private hospitals (not including physicians' salaries). Adding Simone   Sandier's estimate of Fr 170 for physicians' fees in private hospitals,   the equivalent per them costs would be Fr 808. The weighted average comes to $172.       CREDES, Paris.       U.S. data are from NCHS, Current Estimates from the National   Health Interview Survey , 1990, Vital and Health Statistics, Series 10,   no. 181 (Hyattsville, Md.: NCHS, December 1991). French GPs account for   59 percent of all visits to physicians, compared with 30 percent in the   United States. S.M. Schappert, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey:   1990 Summary , Advance Data from Vital and Health Statistics (Hyattsville,    Md.? NCHS, 30 April 1992). If U.S. physicians who specialize in internal    medicine are added, the proportion comes to 43.5. This suggests that the    French make only slightly fewer annual visits to specialists (3?4) than    Americans do (3?85). But home visits, which have practically disappeared    in the United States, account for 17 percent of all physician services in   France. In contrast, hospital outpatient consultations in France were only    5 percent of all physician visits, compared with 13 percent in the United    States (NCHS, Current Estimates from the National Health Interview Survey ).       U.S. data are from NCHS, National Hospital Discharge Survey , Advance   Data from Vital and Health Statistics (3 March 1993).       In France 48 percent of personal health expenditures goes to inpatient   hospital care, leaving 30 percent for ambulatory care and 21 percent for    medical goods - largely drugs (18 percent) - in contrast to 9.3 percent    for drugs in the United States.       OECD Health Data, 1991.      Ibid. The French figure is calculated in OECD purchasing power   parities. The cost difference is much greater than the disparity in GDP   per capita between France ($18,219) and the United States ($21,400) and   explains why French health care expenditures in 1991 were 9.1 percent of   GDP, compared with 13.4 percent in the United States. The GDP per capita   figures are calculated by dividing the GDP of each country by its population   and adjusting the French figure by purchasing power parities.       The MPI includes a market basket of goods and services in the health   sector. Hospital prices have increased far more than pharmaceutical prices   in both countries.       A. Mizrahi, A.

This limit, known as a numerus clausus , has been progressively   lowered from 8,588 to 3,750 students, which now corresponds to 2.5   percent of physicians now in practice.       The new law's planning procedures, known as the carte sanitaire ,   suffer from the same problems as the old law: They are not linked to   reimbursement incentives under national health insurance.

Copayments were increased for laboratory procedures,   selected prescription drugs, and certain physical therapy services.   Also, the allowance of extra-billing by sector 2 physicians contributed   to decreasing health insurance coverage for expenditures on physician   services. In addition, some prescription drugs were eliminated from the   list of eligible drugs for reimbursement, and the daily $ 10 fee for   hospitals was imposed to cover a portion of food and lodging.       This is supported by the fact that national health insurance expenditures   increased at a lower rate than personal health care expenditures between 1980 and 1991.       V.G.

My first book, on the French aircraft industry, examined the internal dynamics of a politically turbulent industry from the Great Depression through the early Cold War. I am now finishing a book on the social and economic reconstruction of France after the Second World War with a focus on why government elites and a variety of social groups came to regard state authority in new ways during what I call the \u201clong Liberation\u201d from 1944 to 1962. This project makes comparisons across several areas of public policy--industrial renewal, family policy, immigration, taxation, and the regulation of the retail trade--where state intervention took controversial new forms. I also have an abiding interest in comparative history and work that examines France in a broader European, colonial, and trans-Atlantic context. In this spirit I have written on steel towns in the U.S. and Europe, have co-authored a textbook stressing inter-regional comparisons in Europe, and have co-edited books on democratization across the globe, on labor relations, and on \u201cRace in France\u201d as understood through French-American comparisons. My current research interests include issues of race and ethnicity, cultures of work, postwar state planning, and center-periphery dynamics in twentieth-century France.

{"detail": [{"content": "Health Care Under French National Health Insurance                 HEALTH CARE  UNDER  FRENCH NATIONAL  HEALTH INSURANCE      by Victor G. Rodwin and Simone Sandier      Prologue: The United States has traditionally looked to the   United Kingdom, its cultural parent, when studying alternative   social and political models. Health care is no exception. In the   early 1980s Canada's health care system as well came under American   scrutiny, and Germany's followed by the end of the decade. In this   paper authors Victor Rodwin and Simone Sandier turn their attention   to the less frequently studied model of France. \"The French health   system is a model no less worthy of study than the British, Canadian,   or German systems,\" they assert. Rodwin has suggested that \"formidable   linguistic and cultural barriers\" to date have discouraged widespread   study of the French system; yet this system is in many ways particularly   relevant for American consideration. Fee-for-service reimbursement, total   freedom of provider choice, an important private forprofit hospital   sector, and patient copayments exemplify a principle of \"liberalism\"   that some Americans find missing in the British and Canadian systems.   However, a principle of \"solidarity\" nourishes a national health   insurance system that provides nearly universal coverage, and stringent   government price controls keep price levels well below those of the   United States. The French public/private mix offers unique possibilities   for U.S. study - all the more so since outcome and performance indicators,   as well as public opinion on the health care system, are more favorable   than in the United States. Rodwin is director of the Office of International   Programs and associate professor of health policy and management at New York  University's (NYU's) Wagner School. He codesigned and directed   ( 1986-1991) NYU's Advanced Management Program for Clinicians.   Sandier is research director at the Centre de Recherche, d'Etudes   et de Documentation en Economie de la Sante (CREDES) in Paris. She   is an elected member of the (U.S.) Institute of Medicine.      Abstract: Several elements of the French health system - the   predominance of office-based medical practice, the mix of private   and public hospitals, the use of patient cost sharing, direct payment   of physicians by patients, and financing derived from payroll taxes - closely   resemble aspects of the U.S. health system. There are four major differences   between the two systems: the French system covers more than 99 percent of   the population; the prices of health services in France are lower than in   the United States; the volume of most services is higher than in the United   States; and French health care spending per capita is lower than in the   United States. Recently enacted and proposed reforms in France likely will   strengthen existing health spending targets and utilization controls.      French national health insurance provides universal coverage and high   levels of services to a population that is, on average, older than that   of the United States. 1 There are no queues for tertiary hospital services,  no \"patient dumping\" arising from financial barriers to care, and no public   complaints about rationing health care. What is more, France spends   9.1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care, compared   with 13.4 percent in the United States. 2 Despite these impressive features   of French national health insurance, there are also flaws. But the French   health system is a model no less worthy of study than the British, Canadian,   or German systems.      Several salient features of the French health care system - the dominance of   office-based private practice ( la medecine liberale ) for ambulatory care,   the mix of public and private hospitals, the widespread use of cost sharing,   the predominant practice of direct payment from patient to doctor, and the   reliance upon financing derived from payroll taxes - resemble elements of the   U.S. health system. These points of convergence make French national health   insurance especially relevant to Americans interested in learning from   abroad. This is all the more true given the current prospects for health   care reform and the interest in proposals for employer-financed national   health insurance.      Overview Of The French Health Care System      The French health care system is characterized by a powerful government   role in assuring universal coverage and regulating the health system,    la medecine liberale and cost sharing, and a public/private mix in both   the financing and the provision of services. These distinguishing   characteristics are grounded in three guiding principles: solidarity,   liberalism, and pluralism. 3 The commitment to universal coverage rests on   the principle of solidarity - the notion that there should be mutual aid and   cooperation between sick and well, active and inactive, and that health   insurance payroll taxes should be calculated on the basis of ability to   pay, not actuarial risk. In France, however, the commitment to universal   coverage goes beyond the financing of national health insurance and includes   the management of a national network of public hospitals, public health   programs, and a small number of publicly financed health centers.      The attachment to la medecine liberale and to cost sharing rests on   the principle of liberalism - the notion that there should be freedom   of choice for physicians and patients and some direct responsibility   for payment by patients. The enduring ideals behind la medecine liberale,   first formulated in 1928 by the principal physician trade union, specified   that physicians should be free to practice on a fee-for-service basis, that   patients should be free to choose their physicians (and vice versa), that   physicians should be assured clinical autonomy, that professional   confidentiality should be respected, and that there should be direct   payment between patients and doctors in private practice.      Finally, the public/private mix in the financing and provision of health   care in France rests on the principle of pluralism - the tolerance of some   organizational diversity, whether it be complementary, competitive, or both.  With respect to financing, pluralism justifies the coexistence of multiple   statutory health insurance schemes, complementary private health insurance   coverage, and significant cost sharing directly by patients. With respect   to the provision of health services, pluralism justifies the coexistence   of public and private hospitals and both office-based private practice and   public ambulatory care.      Medical care organization. The French have access to health services   ranging from those of general practitioners (GPs) in solo practice to   the most sophisticated high-technology procedures in public teaching   hospitals. In contrast to hospital services, where the public sector is   dominant, in ambulatory care - even more so than in the United States - health   services are organized around office-based fee-for-service practice.      Ambulatory care. In France there are more physicians than in the United   States, and they are less specialized (Exhibit 1). Although physicians in   general and family practice represent only 16 percent of all physicians   in office-based private practice in the United States, they make up 53   percent in France. 4 Nurses, physical therapists, speech therapists, and   a range of other professionals also contribute to the provision of   ambulatory care, mostly upon referral and mostly in private practice.   Also, in contrast to the United States, where many simple laboratory   tests are performed in a doctor's office, in France laboratory tests   ordered by all office-based private practitioners and many hospital-based   physicians are performed in independent laboratories. Pharmaceutical products   other than those intended for hospital patients are purchased almost exclusively   in private pharmacies whose locations and prices are regulated by the   Ministry of Health.      Ambulatory care also is provided in health centers located mostly in large   cities, where general practitioners and specialists work part time for  sessional fees. And, there is a network of centers for health checkups and   occupational health services in enterprises that oversee roughly ten million   salaried workers. 5 The French system of maternal and infant health services is   a noteworthy example. About 10 percent of all prenatal consultations are   provided through this public health program. But since French family allowances   for each new pregnancy ($150 a month) are contingent on seven prenatal examinations,   and payment begins in the fifth month of pregnancy, virtually all pregnant women   consult a general practitioner or an obstetrician, most often in private practice   (for 75 percent of the population) or in hospital-based outpatient consultations   (for 15 percent). 6         Exhibit I    Health Care Resources And Utilization, France And United States, 1989 - 1991      Resources   France     United States    Active physicians per thousand    2.67a   2.19b    Active physicians in private, office-based practice 1.89a   1.44b     General/family practice   52.9%     16.0%     Obstetricians, pediatricians, and internists     8.5   30.6     Other specialists   37.6     53.4    Total inpatient hospital beds    9.1a   4.9b    Short-stay hospital beds per thousand    5.1a 4.2 b     Public beds   62.7%     24.8%     Private beds   37.3     75.2      Proprietary beds as percent of private    68.3   13.4      Nonprofit beds as percent of private    31.7   90.8    Utilization    Physician visits per capita   8.3     5.5    Specialist visits per capita 3.4     3.85    Hospital days per capita  2.8     1.2    Short-stay hospital days per capita    1.4   0.8    Admission rate for all inpatient hospital services  23.1%   13.4%    Admission rate for short-stay hospital services     20.8%   12.4%c    Average length-of-stay for all inpatient hospital services (days) 12.3 8.3    Average length-of-stay in short-stay beds (days) 7.0 6.4c        Sources: French data are from ECO-SANTE France,   version 3 (Paris: CREDES, 1991); U.S. data are from Health, United States, 1991.    a 1991. b 1989. c 1991.   National Center for Health Statistics, National Hospital Discharge Survey,   Advance Data from Vital and Health Statistics (3 March 1993).           Hospital care. French public and private hospitals differ in mission,   technical level of medical services, patient clientele, mode of reimbursement   under national health insurance, and managerial autonomy. For example,   teaching and research are the domain of regional public hospitals (Centres   hospitaliers regionaux) that are affiliated with medical schools. Public   hospitals are obligated to accept all patients and to provide emergency care.   Although public and private hospitals serve a cross-section of the population,   the poor are more likely to receive care in public hospitals.      There are more hospital beds per capita in France (9.1 beds per thousand in   1991) than in the United States (4.9 per thousand). 7 In contrast to the   United States, where most short-stay hospital beds are in the private,   nonprofit sector, in France most short-stay hospital beds are in public   institutions; of the remaining beds in private hospitals, most are in   proprietary doctors' hospitals known as cliniques (Exhibit 1). 8      Public hospitals include general and specialized hospitals of variable   size, ranging from regional medical centers dedicated to medical education   and research, which have a virtual monopoly over highly specialized  \"tertiarylevel\" hospitals, to smaller local hospitals. All of these hospitals   are managed by boards of directors that include the mayor and other local   representatives. The director, however, is appointed by the Ministry of   Health in Paris, and appointment of all medical staff, as well as all   significant capital investments, are subject to strict ministerial supervision. 9      The private sector, with 37.3 percent of all short?stay hospital beds in   France, has half of all surgical beds, 28 percent of all psychiatric beds,   and 21 percent of all medical beds. The private, nonprofit sector has over   two-thirds of all private long-term care beds. Cliniques are typically smaller   than public hospitals, with an average of eighty beds. 10 Chniques have   traditionally emphasized elective surgery and obstetrics, leaving more   complex cases to the public sector. With less than 20 percent of all acute care   beds - public and private combined - the cliniques are responsible for 31 percent of   all admissions, of which one-half are for surgery and one-third are for   obstetrics. 11 However, over the past five years there have been a number   of mergers, and some cliniques have begun to develop a capacity for cardiac   surgery and radiation therapy. 12      In France the ratio of nonphysician personnel per bed is higher in   public hospitals (1.8) than in private hospitals (1.2) and, in the aggregate,   is 40 percent less than in U.S. hospitals (1.6 versus 2.7). 13 This striking   difference in hospital staffing may reflect a more technical and intense level   of service in U.S. hospitals. 14 But it largely reflects differences between a  national health insurance system and the U.S. system of health care organization   and financing, which is characterized by large numbers of administrative and   clerical personnel whose main tasks focus on billing multiple payers,   documenting all medical procedures performed, and handling risk management   and quality assurance activities - functions that are only seldom performed by  most French hospital personnel. 15      In summary, the numbers of physicians, hospital beds, and hospital personnel   are higher in France than in the United States. But the technical level appears   to be higher in the United States, where the proportion of specialists in   ambulatory care and the density of staffing in hospitals are higher than in France.      National health insurance. French national health insurance   expanded from an initial program enacted in 1928 to the Social Security   Ordinance of 1945, which covered salaried workers in industry and commerce   and called for universal coverage. The process of expansion, however,   took thirty years to complete. 16 National health insurance was progressively   broadened to include farmers in 1961, the self-employed in 1966-1970, and all   remaining uncovered groups in 1978. 17      In contrast to the United States, with its three principal public   health insurance programs (Medicare, Medicaid, and Civilian Health   and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, or CHAMPUS) and over a   thousand private insurers each following different underwriting, benefit,  and reimbursement policies, the French active population is covered by   statutory, occupation-based, national health insurance schemes that are   part of the social security system. 18 All dependents are automatically   covered, as are the unemployed and the retired. National health insurance   funds are organized into regional and local funds, all of which are, in French   administrative law, private organizations charged with the provision of a public   service. However, since their total annual expenditure exceeds that of the   government's budget, the funds are closely supervised by the Ministry of   Social Affairs as well as the Ministry of Finance and are therefore, in   practice, quasi-public organizations. Health insurance premiums (payroll   tax rates) are set by the government, as are the range of benefits, which   are, with minor exceptions, uniform across national health insurance schemes.   In addition, the central government oversees a process of national negotiations  between the three principal national health insurance funds and representatives   of health care providers. It thereby assures that all providers are subject to   uniform reimbursement policies irrespective of the schemes under which patients   are covered.      Eighty percent of the population - mostly salaried workers and their   dependents - are covered under the General National Health Insurance Scheme,   which is managed by the Caisse Nationale de l'Assurance Maladie des   Travailleurs Salaries (CNAMTS). Nine percent of the populationmostly   farmers, their salaried workers, and management and administrative personnel   in agriculture and their dependents - are covered by two health insurance schemes,   both managed by the Mutualite Sociale Agricole (MSA). 19 Six percent of the   population - the self-employed - are covered by a fourth scheme managed by the    Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie et Maternite des Travailleurs non-Salaries   des Professions non Agricoles (CANAM). The remaining 5 percent of the insured   population and their dependents - miners, railway workers, subway workers,   notaries public, the clergy, artists, and others - are covered under   eleven smaller schemes, all having their inherited and well-defended   entitlements.      French national health insurance provides financial coverage for   comprehensive services ranging from inpatient hospital care to outpatient   services, maternity care, prescription drugs (including homeopathic products),   thermal cures in spas, long-term care, cash benefits, and, to a lesser extent,   dental and vision care. However, there remain small differences in benefits among   occupational groups. The self-employed pay higher copayments for ambulatory care,   while some of the smaller schemes, such as those for railway workers and miners,    require lower copayments or provide services directly to their beneficiaries.    Smaller funds with older, higher-risk populations are subsidized by the    CNAMTS as well as by the government. 20      Benefits coverage and patient reimbursement. In France there are no   restrictions on provider choice - no preferred provider organizations (PPOs),   no gatekeeper functions for primary care physicians, and no limits on the   quantity of services covered under national health insurance. As a general   rule, French patients pay the full fees directly to health care providers and   subsequently obtain partial or more rarely full reimbursement from their health   insurance funds. 21 The amounts reimbursed to patients under French national   health insurance are calculated on the basis of negotiated rates minus a   copayment, depending on the kind of service. 22 Charges borne by the patient,   however, may differ from copayments. It is important to emphasize that close   to one-third of French physicians have opted to charge fees in excess of   the nationally negotiated charges. Also, there are exceptions to the rules   about both direct payment and copayments. 23      Health care financing. To finance benefits under French national health   insurance for the 80 percent of the population covered by the CNAMTS,   employers pay 12.8 percent of the wage bill, and employees pay 6.9 percent   of their full salary, bringing the total payroll tax for health insurance to 19.7  percent of all wages. 24      The funds raised by mandatory payroll taxes finance 74 percent of personal   health expenditures in France (Exhibit 2). The remainder is financed by the   central government, by patients'out-of-pocket payments, and by an elaborate   range of private insurance schemes offering complementary insurance coverage.   Eighty-four percent of the French population has private complementary   health insurance coverage provided by commercial or nonprofit (mutual   aid society) insurers. 25 Paradoxically, despite universal coverage in France,   although aggregate out-of-pocket payments are 16 percent in comparison with   23.3 percent in the United States, for specific categories such as hospital   and physician services, the percentage of out-of-pocket payments is actually   higher in France than in the United States (Exhibit 2). In contrast, for   prescription drugs, the share of out-of-pocket payments in the United States   far exceeds that in France.

French out-of-pocket spending amounts include payments by private    complementary insurers amounting to 2.3 percent of total personal health    care expenditures, but the breakdown by type is not known. Thus, strictly    speaking, direct out-of-pocket payments more likely represent 16 percent    rather than 18.8 percent of total personal health care expenditures, while    private insurance finding is closer to 9 percent of total personal health    care expenditures.    a National health insurance.         Provider payment. French physicians and other health professionals   in private practice are paid directly by patients on a fee-for-service basis.   Cliniques are still reimbursed on the basis of nationally negotiated daily   fees and charges. 26 Public hospitals receive annual operating budgets, and   unit prices for prescription drugs are set by an interministerial commission.      Charges for services provided by health professionals - whether in   officebased private practice, in outpatient services of public   hospitals, or in private hospitals - are negotiated every year within   the framework of national agreements concluded between representatives   of the health professions and the three principal health insurance funds. 27   These agreements establish the terms of payment according to a fee schedule. 28   The process of updating the relative value scale (RVS) to account for new   procedures, changing technologies, and their effects on the costs of production   is also the result of negotiations among the health professions, the national  health insurance funds, and the government. The assignment of values (in   current prices) is the object of even more heated negotiations, which have   been at the center of the government's frustrated efforts to control the   growth of health care spending. Once negotiated, the charges must be   respected by all physicians, except for the one-third (sector 2 physicians)   who either have chosen or have earned the right to engage in extra-billing. 29      The payment of hospital care is different for private and public facilities.    Cliniques , as well as private nonprofit hospitals, are reimbursed directly by   the national health insurance funds on the basis of a negotiated daily  charge and a fee schedule for hospital-specific charges for such services as   the use of an operating room. The remaining balance - a 20 percent copayment for   the daily charge - is recovered directly by cliniques from patients. Physicians   in cliniques , as in private practice, typically bill their patients directly;   patients in turn are reimbursed according to the charges of the national fee   schedule.      Since 1985 public hospitals are paid for their operating expenditures in   monthly installments on the basis of prospectively set operating budgets.   30 The amount of the budget is set by the Ministry of Health. 31 It is paid,   however, by national health insurance funds in proportion to the number of   hospital bed days of their beneficiaries and, to a much smaller extent, by   income derived from daily charges and copayments. 32 All physicians in public   hospitals are compensated on the basis of salary payment and sessional fees. 33   In addition, for service chiefs, there is an option to engage in limited   private practice within the public hospital.      Prices for prescription drugs allowable for reimbursement are set by a   national commission that includes representatives from the Ministries of   Health, Finance, and Industry. The commission sets prices for specific   doses and unit packages, taking into account analogous drugs already on   the market. For truly innovative products, prices are set in relation to   the costs of production, including research costs and evaluation of   therapeutic value.      Health care services. Existing data - whether they come from surveys or are   byproducts of the administrative system - consistently indicate that the   French, in comparison to Americans, consult their doctors more often,   are admitted to the hospital more often, and purchase more prescription   drugs. Yet health expenditures per capita are lower in France, since the   average prices of physician services, prescription drugs, and hospital   services are significantly lower than in the United States.      Prices. Despite the difficulties of comparing prices for goods and services   that are not identical, there is much evidence that average prices of physician   services, hospital services, and prescription drugs are lower in France than   in the United States. 34 Since May 1992, for example, the average charges for  an office visit to a French GP and a specialist are $18 and $25, respectively,   in contrast to the average price of $42 for an office visit to an American   GP. 35 Comparison of physicians' incomes in the two countries gives further   supporting evidence that French medical prices are relatively low. In 1990   the average annual net income, before taxes, of French physicians in private   practice ($69,300) was 42 percent of the annual income of their U.S.   counterparts ($164,300). 36      While the average per them rate for community hospitals in the United   States in 1988 was estimated at $590, in France the average would be   closer to $172. 37 Likewise, despite the difficulties of making price   comparisons, one can estimate that French pharmaceutical prices - the   lowest in Europe - are, on average, 50 percent lower than American prices. 38      Utilization. As in the United States, in the course of a year 78   percent of the French consult a physician at least once, but the   number of physician visits per capita is significantly higher in France   (8.3) than in the United States (5.5). 39 The average number of hospital   days per capita is also higher in France than in the United States: 2.8   versus 1.2 in all hospitals and 1.4 versus 0.8 in short-stay hospitals.   This difference derives from the higher hospital admission rate in France   (23 percent) than in the United States (13.4 percent). The average   length-of-stay in acute care hospitals is only slightly higher in   France than in the United States (Exhibit 1). 40      Consumption disparities for pharmaceuticals are even wider. On average,   the French use twice as many drugs per capita as Americans do. French   physicians prescribe drugs more often (for 75 percent of their consultations)   than American physicians (60 percent) and order twice as many different   drug products per prescription (an average of 3.2 versus 1.8). 41       Expenditures. Despite their low average prices for medical goods and   services, the French spend more for their health care than most of their   European neighbors spend because they are high users of physician services,   hospitals, and prescription drugs. 42 Yet comparative analysis of health   expenditures among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development   (OECD) nations indicates that per capita spending on personal health care   in France ($1,650) was 43 percent less than that in the United States   ($2,867) in 1991. 43      Assessment Of The French Model      The French model of health care organization and national health   insurance has not spared French policymakers from needing to tackle   the problems faced by their American counterparts: cost control and   inequalities in health status and access to care. But in terms of basic   outcome and performance criteria, the French model appears strong compared   with the U.S. model.      Cost control. The slowdown in the general economy and the problems of   financing national health insurance and the rest of the social security   system during the late 1970s led the French government to impose stringent   measures to contain the rate of increase of health care costs. These measures   aimed to control the medium-term growth of national health insurance spending   by influencing the supply of as well as the demand for health services. Their   probable effects may be examined by analyzing the evolution of health   care spending between 1970 and 1990.      In contrast to U.S. experience, in France the average annual rate of  increase in health spending, deflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI),   declined over the past two decades (Exhibit 3). While the annual growth rate   in real health spending from 1970 to 1975 was 7.2 percent, it dropped to 4.0   percent from 1985 to 1990. The equivalent U.S. rate rose from 5.0 percent to   6.0 percent.      The most striking contrast in the rate of health spending increase between   France and the United States is the difference in the rates of medical-specific   inflation - the medical price index (MPI) deflated by the CPI (Exhibit 4). 44   The national agreements negotiated among representatives of the medical   profession, the national health insurance funds, and the government in 1980   and 1985 appear to have been effective in maintaining low medical prices.   The decrease in these rates in France from 1970 to 1985 and their low rate   of increase from 1985 to 1990 reveal the success of French national health   insurance in keeping professional charges, daily fees, and pharmaceutical   prices low.        When one examines the evolution of health expenditures deflated by the MPI   (the volume of health services), there is also clear evidence of deceleration   in France, although not as much as successive governments have attempted to   achieve (Exhibit 5). Despite the decelerating trend, the volume of health   services in France has increased at higher average rates than in the United   States and most other OECD countries. As for the success of cost control   policies pursued in France, it is difficult to attribute the deceleration    depicted in Exhibit 5 to the specific measures implemented because a slow but    certain deceleration in volume has been documented since 1950. 45              One noteworthy measure to control the volume of health services over the   long run was the imposition of a limit, since 1971, on the number of  medical students admitted to the second year of medical school. 46    The policy reflects the current climate of opinion that assumes that    there are too many physicians; however, it takes at least ten years for    such a policy to have any effect. Thus, while the number of physicians per   capita is increasing more slowly in the 1990s (1.5 percent per year) than   in the 1980s (3.2 percent per year), the limit has caused the number of   students admitted to the second year of medical school to decrease, which   may result in a physician shortage in the early years of the next century.      In the hospital sector there have been controls on construction and capital   expenditures since the passage of the Hospital Law in 1970, which established   hospital planning procedures and population-based service standards for the   acquisition of new medical technologies. The most recent Hospital Law,   passed in 1991, reinforces hospital planning and service standards to promote   regionalization and controls over hospital investments. 47 As for hospital   operating expenditures, since 1979 the government has reinforced its   traditional price controls on daily fees in public hospitals by imposing   a total expenditure ceiling for all public hospitals.      Over the past decade a number of measures have been undertaken to increase   patients' out-of-pocket payments. 48 It is not possible to assess whether   these measures actually contributed to restraining the use of medical care,   but there is no doubt that the share of patient out-of-pocket payments   (including private insurance premiums) in total personal health expenditures   rose from 15.6 percent in 1980 to 19.3 percent in 1991. 49      Beyond cost control measures aimed at influencing the supply of and demand   for health services, recent policy has aimed directly at extending the cap   on public hospital expenditures to private hospitals and ambulatory care. In   1992 national agreements were concluded with representatives of cliniques ,   laboratories, and nurses working in the private sector. These groups agreed   to work within a nationally set expenditure target. As for physicians, after   much handwringing and acrimonious debate, for the first time in the history   of their negotiations with the government and the national health insurance   funds, all three physician associations have accepted the principle of an   expenditure target, as well as national practice guidelines that have yet   to be defined.      Whether and how any of these agreements will actually be implemented remains   to be seen. The concept of an expenditure target itself is ambiguous for   physician services, for which patients' out-of-pocket payments already   finance 28.3 percent of health spending. Will the target apply to all   health spending with the risk of jeopardizing access to care by all   patients and restricting physicians' clinical autonomy, or will it apply   only to spending reimbursed under French national health insurance at the   risk of reducing the level of coverage and possibly increasing inequalities   in access to medical care? In addition to such conceptual issues, the   information required to identify physicians who provide inappropriate   services within the new expenditure targets is seriously deficient in France,   given the absence of reliable data on diagnoses and precise procedures performed.      Beyond these technical issues, formidable political obstacles stand in   the way of implementing cost control policies. Despite efforts to control   both demand for and supply of health services, French policymakers have   encountered powerful resistance from the health professions and the general   population. Some measures taken in the name of cost containment have been   retracted in response to political opposition. In 1986, for example, when   Health Minister Philippe Seguin imposed copayments for high-cost illnesses   that previously were exempt, the elderly were severely hit. This contributed   to the fall of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's government in 1988, and the   next government eliminated most of Seguin's measures.      Inequalities in health. Although French national health insurance has   effectively eliminated significant financial barriers to medical care   and despite universal coverage of the population, there remain wide   disparities among social classes in patterns of medical care use; the   distribution of health resources is also highly skewed in favor of urban   areas and well-to-do regions. Moreover, as in other systems in which health   outcome indicators have been compared with measures of socioeconomic status,   in France there are significant inequalities. 50      With regard to patterns of use, the most well-to-do and educated French   people rely more on office-based private practice, particularly the services    of specialists and dentists. The more disadvantaged groups, including laborers,    make greater use of GPs and public hospitals. From 1960 to 1980 these    disparities diminished, but since 1980 they have been exacerbated? 51    These disparities are matched by equally flagrant disparities in life    expectancy. For example, during 1980-1989 the life expectancy of an engineer    at age thirty-five (forty-five years) was higher by nine years (25 percent)    than that of a manual worker (35.8 years). 52 Of course, differences in life    expectancy reflect such factors as education, housing, and working    conditions and cannot be attributed solely to differential access to    medical care. But it is important to note that the medical system has been    unable to compensate for these and other inequalities.      Outcomes and performance criteria. On the basis of life expectancy and   infant mortality indicators, France comes out ahead of the United States   and relatively high in comparison to the rest of Europe. 53 A girl born in   France in 1991 could expect to live 81.1 years, in comparison to 79.1  years in the United States. 54 As for infant mortality, in 1991 there were 7.3   deaths for every thousand live births in France, in contrast to 8.9 per   thousand in the United States. 55 These indicators are hardly complete enough   to draw inferences on the relative health status of the French and American   populations because they do not account for other dimensions of health such   as functional autonomy and well-being. But they are the only  v, tcomparable data available. In terms of patient satisfaction,   although polls in France have found different results depending   on the nature of the questions posed, a 1990 comparative survey   suggests that France ranks high in comparison to the United States. 56   In the United States 60 percent of the population felt that fundamental   changes are needed; in France 42 percent of the population shared this   feeling. 57      Concluding Observations      There are two striking differences between the health systems in   France and in the United States: the universal coverage of the French   population under a national health insurance program, and the lower   level of per capita health spending in France despite higher outcome   and performance indicators. Over the past five years, however, French   policymakers have had less success than other nations - notably Britain,   Canada, and Germany - in containing their rising health care costs. Health   care prices have effectively been kept low, but the volume of services - whether   measured in physical quantities (use of services) or in health spending deflated   by the MPI - remains high in comparison with the United States. Nevertheless,   much like the Canadian experience, price controls in France have been stronger   than the volume response, which in no small part explains why health care   expenditures in France are lower than in the United States and have grown   more slowly over the past fifteen years. 58      The French consult their doctors more often than Americans do, are admitted   to the hospital more often, and purchase more prescription drugs. Despite   wide disparities among French social classes in mortality and in patterns   of medical care use, when judged on basic outcome measures (life expectancy   and infant mortality) and polls of consumer satisfaction, the French health   care system comes out ahead of the U.S. system.      French national health insurance allows for free choice of providers and   clinical autonomy of physicians even more so than in the United States.   French physicians are never asked to play gatekeeper functions and are   not subject to the kind of utilization review and quality assurance   bureaucracy that has transformed the working lives of American doctors.   But this freedom has at least two consequences. First, for patients, direct   payment for most ambulatory care, the growth of extra-billing, and out-of-pocket   payments amounting to almost one-fifth of personal health care expenditures   are the quid pro quo for universal national health insurance with no   restrictions on patient-demanded services. Second, in exchange for more   clinical autonomy than American providers now enjoy and a national health   insurance system with universal coverage, French physicians and other   providers have learned to live with lower prices and lower incomes than   their American counterparts receive.      Health care reform in France is likely to strengthen expenditure   targets and utilization controls. The Loi Teulade , passed 4 January   1993, calls for national practice guidelines and routine collection of   information on patient diagnoses and physicians' procedure codes. The rapid   growth of health spending and volume of services no doubt will continue to   put pressure on French government officials to tolerate sector 2 physicians   and rising copayments. Along with opportunities for the growth of cliniques ,    this will be justified in the name of liberalism and pluralism. On the    other hand, the French commitment to solidarity will surely constrain these    developments. It will keep prices low, keep limits on the percentage of sector    2 physicians, cap payroll tax rates for all national health insurance funds,    and assure uniform payment rates to providers across all funds.

A large part of this   disparity may be explained by the fact that French hospitals, more so   than their U.S. counterparts, sometimes provide long-term care for the   elderly. But even if one compares only short-stay beds, there are still   more in France (5.1 per thousand) than in the United States (4.2 per thousand).   The U.S. data on beds are divided by the resident population of 248,239,000 in 1991.

Between 1985 and 1989 the rate of growth of high-technology   equipment - for example, scanners, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines,   and lithotriptors - has been higher in the proprietary sector than in public   hospitals. For example, the number of scanners tripled in cliniques and   increased by only 60 percent in the public sector. Between 1987 and 1989   lithotriptors in cliniques increased by 85 percent and MRI machines by 40   percent, whereas in the public sector they increased by 32 percent and 20   percent, respectively.

For a patient group with   the same severity of illness, invasive monitoring was used less for French   than for U.S. patients. W.

Dumont, La securite sociale, toujours en chantier (Paris: Les   Editions Ouvrieres, 198 1 ).       In 1991, 99.4 percent of the French resident population was covered   under national health insurance, leaving 300,000 to 400,000 people without   coverage. These people are considered medically indigent and are cared   for in public facilities that are reimbursed from public funds. Dupeyroux,    Droit de la securite sociale       Social security in France comprises an assortment of quasi-autonomous   national funds ranging from pensions to workers'compensation, family benefits,   and health insurance.      For more detail on the MSA, see F. Mandersheid, Une aurre securite   sociale: La mutualite sociale agricole (Paris: L'Harmattan, 1991).       For example, the MSA covers only 20 percent of its budget from   payroll tax contributions of its employed beneficiaries. Forty percent   comes from the General National Health Insurance Scheme for so-called   demographic compensation. Another 10 percent is a direct subsidy from the   government budget, and the remainder is raised through other taxes (on   agricultural products), other contributions, and interest on capital.   These figures are from the Budget Annexe des Prestations Sociales Agricoles   (BAPSA), Departement Etudes Economiques et Financieres (MSA, 1993). Each of the   eleven smaller health insurance schemes benefits from demographic compensation,   all in the name of solidarity. For example, the payroll tax contributions   of the employed clergy covered 60 percent of their scheme's expenditures   in 1991; the remainder was transferred by the General National Health   Insurance Scheme. Figures are from Les Comptes de la Securite Sociale,   Commission des Comptes de la Securite Sociale (July 1992).       To be eligible for reimbursement under national health insurance,  medical goods and services must be registered on a national list of   prescription drugs, appliances, prostheses, and medical procedures.    Also, all services and procedures must be performed or prescribed by a    physician, and all providers must be certified health professionals,    medical facilities, or pharmacies.       The copayment in France is known as a ticket moderateur . Under the   General National Health Insurance Scheme, the copayment is 25 percent   for physician services, 35 percent for private nursing services and   laboratory tests, and typically 30 percent for prescription drugs.   Essential drugs are exempt from copayments, but the copayment is set   at 60 percent for so-called comfort drugs. Patients in public and   private hospitals typically are required to pay 20 percent of the per   them rates plus a daily fee (roughly $10) to cover meals. Patients in    cliniques also pay copayments for all physician services, procedures,   and laboratory tests.      Public hospitals, most cliniques , and health centers generally   are exceptions to the practice of direct payment from patients to   providers. Patients are exempted from copayments in the following cases:   (I) for major medical or surgical procedures, defined as being equal to or   exceeding the approximate severity of an appendectomy, coded as KC-50 in   the French RVS (as of January 1993, the value of KC was approximately Ft 13,   making the fee for KC-50 equal to approximately $125); (2) for maternity care   and medical care resulting from accidents at work; (3) for hospital stays    exceeding thirty days; and (4) for serious, debilitating, or chronic illness.    There are thirty illnesses for which all patients are exempt from copayments.   The so-called thirty-first illness includes any degenerative condition not    included among the thirty illnesses. The so-called thirty-second illness    refers to multiple conditions (comorbidities) that make patients severely    disabled. The exemption from copayments for the thirty-first and    thirty-second illnesses is granted only upon approval of physicians    working for health insurance funds, so-called medical controllers.       These rates have been in effect since January 1992. Similar rates   apply for the population of salaried agricultural workers and special   occupations with their own health insurance schemes. Farmers and the    self-employed are taxed largely on the basis of their declared incomes.    It is important to note that in addition to health insurance benefits, the   revenues raised under the General National Health Insurance Scheme cover    cash benefits (salary continuation) as well as subsidies to the MSA and    smaller health insurance funds with older, higher-risk beneficiaries    (see Note 20).       Complementary health insurance coverage is generally linked to   occupation. The most well-to-do tend to have the most complete coverage   as well as the most supplementary benefits. Of the 84 percent of the   population subscribing to complementary health insurance policies, 61   percent join mutual aid societies ( mutuelles ), 24 percent subscribe to   private commercial insurance, and 15 percent have a caisse de prevoyance.   A. Bocognano et al., Enquete sur La sante et la protection sociale en 1990:    Premiers resultats (Paris: CREDES, 1991).       The new agreement in 1991 among cliniques, the national health   insurance funds, and the government called for the use of case-mix   criteria as well as expenditure targets in the determination of future   per them rates. J.C. Stephan, Seminaire d'information de l'UHP (Paris:   Formamed, 1992).       The first national agreements with physicians date from 1960 and   differ according to region. Since 1971 the agreements have lasted an   average of five years. The negotiation process has most often been   acrimonious, complicated, and long, revealing the conflicts among the   government's objectives of cost containment, payers' concerns about access,   and the profession's attachment to autonomy and purchasing power. V. Rodwin,   H. Grable, and G. Thiel, \"Updating the Fee Schedule for Physician Reimbursement:   A Comparative Analysis of France, Germany, and Canada,\" Quality Assurance    and Utilization Review (February 1990): 16-24; and D. Wilsford, Doctors and    the State: The Politics of Health Care in France and the United States    (Durham, N.C.. and London: Duke University Press, 1991).       The French fee schedule classifies all procedures eligible for   reimbursement according to an RVS. The charge for each procedure is   calculated by multiplying its relative value by the negotiated rate   (conversion factor). Thus, for example, the charge for an appendectomy   or simple hernia operation, coded as KC-50, will be ten times the charge   for removal of an ingrown toenail, coded as KC-10. The French RVS is   known as the Nomenclature Generale des Acres Professionnels (NGAP),    originally written in 1930 by a physician trade union, the Confederation    des Syndicats Medicaux Franqais . Its procedures are classified around    so-called key letters: C signifies a consultation with a general practitioner;    Cs, a consultation with a specialist; and V, a home visit by a general    practitioner. B signifies laboratory tests; Z signifies radiological    procedures; K signifies diagnostic procedures; and KC signifies surgical    procedures. Since a letter followed by a coefficient usually corresponds to    many different procedures, it is impossible for fund administrators to know    exactly for what procedures they are paying.      Three groups of physicians have the right to engage in extra-billing:   (1) those who have opted out of the system (0.4 percent of physicians),   for whom the national health insurance funds will reimburse nothing to patients;   (2) those who before 1979 had earned the right to exceed negotiated charges due   to their status and prestige in the medical community (3.4 percent of physicians);   and (3) those who since 1980, in exchange for giving up certain health benefits    and tax write-offs, choose to join the so-called sector 2 and thereby earn the    right to exceed negotiated charges so long as they do so with \"tact and measure\"    (25.7 percent of physicians). See \"Le secteur liberal des professions de sante,   premiers resultats,\" Bloc note statistique 68 (Paris: CNAMTS, May 1993). An    increasing number of physicians have joined sector 2, particularly specialists   in large cities. Although tact and measure has never been defined, surveys    indicate that extra-billing represents approximately 10 percent of total   physician income and that the average extra charge is 50 percent above the    allowed fee. For example, in 1992, for an average charge of Fr 93.6 (for a     GP visit, patients paid an average fee of Fr 138.8 for GPs in sector 2),     patients were reimbursed 75 percent of 93.6 (Fr 70.2) and paid Fr 68.6     (138.8 minus 70.2) from complementary private insurance reimbursement     or out of pocket. Thus, the official rate of reimbursement for GP visits     under national health insurance (75 percent) is considerably higher than     the actual rate (49.4 percent). Patients who visit physicians in the     second and third categories are reimbursed the full amount of charges     less copayments, thus leaving them to finance the remainder themselves    from complementary insurance policies or out of pocket.       G. de Pouvourville, \"Hospital Reforms in France under a Socialist   Government,\" The Milbank Quarterly 64, no. 3 (1986): 392-413.      For the time being, this amount is calculated largely on the basis of   last year's budget, an analysis of hospital activities, and an allowable   rate of increase. Meanwhile, hospitals are collecting case-mix information   that eventually may be used in budget setting.      For outpatient consultations in public hospitals, the patient has   the option of advancing only the amount of the copayment, and the hospital   recovers the rest directly from the patient's health insurance fund.       The sessional fees are the basis of payment largely to part-time   physicians working in private practice - attaches - who have an affiliation   with specific service units in the public hospital to work a certain number   of half-day shifts, most often for outpatient consultations or procedures.   These physicians in France are the closest French equivalent to attending   physicians in private hospitals in the United States.       We have been using the term charges to indicate negotiated payment   rates for physician services. Physicians with the right to exceed these   charges may bill patients for their fees. Average physician prices therefore   are higher than charges as estimated in the following note. In converting   francs to dollars, throughout this paper we have used the rate of 5.5 francs   to the dollar.       The allowable charge for an office visit to a French general practitioner   is Fr 100; to a specialist, Fr 140. Even if one adds the charges for simple   laboratory tests, often performed in a doctor's office in the United States    but always referred to a private laboratory in France, the average French price   for a GP office visit is still at least 27 percent lower. The average charge    for GP services in 1991 was Fr 137. To this we add 20 percent for laboratory    services and 10 percent for extra-billing, bringing the figure to Fr 183,    or about $33.       The figure for the average annual income of U.S. physicians is from   the American Medical Association, as cited in The Washington Post , 21    May 1992. The average annual income of French physicians is Fr 381,200.    Differences in national income between France and the United States    explain only part of this disparity, since the ratio of average?   physician income to average per capita income in 1990 was 4.4 in    France and 7.9 in the United States. Data on per capita income    (GDP per capita) in adjusted U.S. dollar purchasing power parities    are from OECD Health Data: $18,219 for France; $21,400 for the United    States.       The average per them costs (including physicians' salaries) were Fr   1,023 ($186) in 1988 for all public community hospitals and Fr 638 for   private hospitals (not including physicians' salaries). Adding Simone   Sandier's estimate of Fr 170 for physicians' fees in private hospitals,   the equivalent per them costs would be Fr 808. The weighted average comes to $172.       CREDES, Paris.       U.S. data are from NCHS, Current Estimates from the National   Health Interview Survey , 1990, Vital and Health Statistics, Series 10,   no. 181 (Hyattsville, Md.: NCHS, December 1991). French GPs account for   59 percent of all visits to physicians, compared with 30 percent in the   United States. S.M. Schappert, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey:   1990 Summary , Advance Data from Vital and Health Statistics (Hyattsville,    Md.? NCHS, 30 April 1992). If U.S. physicians who specialize in internal    medicine are added, the proportion comes to 43.5. This suggests that the    French make only slightly fewer annual visits to specialists (3?4) than    Americans do (3?85). But home visits, which have practically disappeared    in the United States, account for 17 percent of all physician services in   France. In contrast, hospital outpatient consultations in France were only    5 percent of all physician visits, compared with 13 percent in the United    States (NCHS, Current Estimates from the National Health Interview Survey ).       U.S. data are from NCHS, National Hospital Discharge Survey , Advance   Data from Vital and Health Statistics (3 March 1993).       In France 48 percent of personal health expenditures goes to inpatient   hospital care, leaving 30 percent for ambulatory care and 21 percent for    medical goods - largely drugs (18 percent) - in contrast to 9.3 percent    for drugs in the United States.       OECD Health Data, 1991.      Ibid. The French figure is calculated in OECD purchasing power   parities. The cost difference is much greater than the disparity in GDP   per capita between France ($18,219) and the United States ($21,400) and   explains why French health care expenditures in 1991 were 9.1 percent of   GDP, compared with 13.4 percent in the United States. The GDP per capita   figures are calculated by dividing the GDP of each country by its population   and adjusting the French figure by purchasing power parities.       The MPI includes a market basket of goods and services in the health   sector. Hospital prices have increased far more than pharmaceutical prices   in both countries.       A. Mizrahi, A. Mizrahi, and S. Sandier, \"Le systeme de sante en   France de 1950 A 1989,\" Journal d'Economie Medicale 9, no. 8 (1991): 379-405.       This limit, known as a numerus clausus , has been progressively   lowered from 8,588 to 3,750 students, which now corresponds to 2.5   percent of physicians now in practice.       The new law's planning procedures, known as the carte sanitaire ,   suffer from the same problems as the old law: They are not linked to   reimbursement incentives under national health insurance. See V.G.    Rodwin, \"On the Separation of Health Planning and Provider Reimbursement:   The U.S. and France,\" Inquiry (Summer 1980:139-150.       Copayments were increased for laboratory procedures,   selected prescription drugs, and certain physical therapy services.   Also, the allowance of extra-billing by sector 2 physicians contributed   to decreasing health insurance coverage for expenditures on physician   services. In addition, some prescription drugs were eliminated from the   list of eligible drugs for reimbursement, and the daily $ 10 fee for   hospitals was imposed to cover a portion of food and lodging.       This is supported by the fact that national health insurance expenditures   increased at a lower rate than personal health care expenditures between 1980 and 1991.       V.G.

U.S. data are from the NCHS. Data for the rest of Europe are from   OECD Health Data. The 1990-1991 unpublished U.S. data were communicated   by Jack Feldman of the NCHS.       From 1981 to 19911 ife expectancy for women increased 2.6 years   in France, compared with 1.8 years in the United States; for men it   increased 2.6 years, compared with 1.8 years (U.S. data are from the   NCHS; data for 1990-1991 are provisional figures). For French men,   the situation is not as good. Their life expectancy surpassed that   of American men beginning in 1984 but is only 0.8 years greater   (73.0 versus 72.2). In both countries life expectancy has increased,   but over the past ten years the progression has been faster in France.       U.S. data are from the NCHS.       R.J.

My first book, on the French aircraft industry, examined the internal dynamics of a politically turbulent industry from the Great Depression through the early Cold War. I am now finishing a book on the social and economic reconstruction of France after the Second World War with a focus on why government elites and a variety of social groups came to regard state authority in new ways during what I call the \u201clong Liberation\u201d from 1944 to 1962. This project makes comparisons across several areas of public policy--industrial renewal, family policy, immigration, taxation, and the regulation of the retail trade--where state intervention took controversial new forms. I also have an abiding interest in comparative history and work that examines France in a broader European, colonial, and trans-Atlantic context. In this spirit I have written on steel towns in the U.S. and Europe, have co-authored a textbook stressing inter-regional comparisons in Europe, and have co-edited books on democratization across the globe, on labor relations, and on \u201cRace in France\u201d as understood through French-American comparisons. My current research interests include issues of race and ethnicity, cultures of work, postwar state planning, and center-periphery dynamics in twentieth-century France. I also serve as the editor of the journal French Politics, Culture & Society, which is jointly sponsored by NYU's Institute of French Studies and Harvard University's Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies.

Benson is an associate professor in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and an affiliated faculty member in the Department of Sociology. He holds a PhD in sociology from the University of California, Berkeley.   Benson\u2019s book, Shaping Immigration News: A French-American Comparison , received the Tankard Award to honor scholarship that, according to AEJMC, \u201cbreaks new ground in the field of journalism and mass communication\u201d research.   The book, published in 2013 by Cambridge University Press, compares immigration news coverage in the U.S. and France from the early 1970s through the 2000s, drawing on detailed text and image analysis and nearly 100 interviews with journalists in Paris, Los Angeles, and New York. Benson uses the comparative case study to draw broader conclusions about journalistic practices and performance in the two countries. According to Cambridge University Press\u2019s description of the book, Benson \u201cchallenges classic liberalism's assumptions about state intervention's chilling effects on the press, suggests costs as well as benefits to the current vogue in personalized narrative news, and calls attention to journalistic practices that can help empower civil society.\u201d   Shaping Immigration News has already received praise from a range of leading sociologists and media scholars.   Silvio Waisbord of George Washington University writes: &quot;Benson has amassed powerful evidence showing why globalization does not make journalism homogeneous across borders\u2026This book should be of interest to scholars interested in understanding the possibility for multiperspectival and critical journalism in democratic societies, as well as continuities and changes in fluid news systems. Benson has produced a sophisticated, elegant, and evidence-packed cross-national analysis that will be a go-to reference for comparative media research.&quot;   Paul DiMaggio of Princeton University writes: &quot;Comparing the experiences of France and the United States for explanatory leverage, the author of this fine book identifies and tracks the prevalence of alternative frames and authorized spokespersons in immigration news over four decades - and in so doing demonstrates how institutional differences in the journalistic field refract coverage of events and debates in striking and often unanticipated ways.&quot;   AEJMC, the national association of journalism and mass communication scholars and media professionals, established the Tankard Book Award in 2007 in honor of communication scholar James W.
