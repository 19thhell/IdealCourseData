Taking a risk reduction approach, we address topics including stress, alcohol and other drugs, mental and sexual health, sleep, healthy eating, sexual assault prevention, and bystander intervention. Interactive, engaging information empowers students to make informed and healthy choices while at NYU and beyond. We work closely with students to support activities that create a healthier environment for the entire NYU community.
