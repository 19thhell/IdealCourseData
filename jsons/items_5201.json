Taking the Writing II course and receiving a minimum grade of C will fulfill the writing proficiency requirements.          Freshmen students will not receive transfer credit for writing courses taken while in high school.       Internal Transfer Students (Including Students Admitted as Freshmen to Other NYU Schools       Internal Transfer students who have taken and passed EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay and the Writing Proficiency exam are not required to enroll in the secnd writing course, ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay; Education and the Professions.

External Transfer Students       Transfer students with two transfer courses in college writing will satisfy EXPOS-UA 0001 and ACE-UE 0110. Students should take and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination during Orientation. Students who miss the examination should read the registration instructions .          Transfer students with one transfer course in college writing should be advised to enroll in EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. Students should take and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination during Orientation.

Students will satisfy the writing proficiency requirement if they earn a grade of C or better in EXPOS-UA 0001.          Transfer students with zero courses in college writing who pass EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, are exempt from ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay. Students will satisfy the credits from the exemption from ACE-UE 0110 as liberal arts electives.          Transfer students who have transferred into NYU with a minimum of 21 credits from previous institutions or from a school within NYU (excluding credits earned while in high school or AP/IB credits) may apply for a waiver from the required course, EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay.

Transfer students who establish their matriculation in the fall should submit their waiver application to EWP by October 1. Transfer students who establish their matriculation in the spring should submit their waiver application to EWP by March 1. If the deadline falls on a holiday or weekend day, the deadline is the next business day. Students should adhere to the deadlines if they wish to have a decision before the advisement period for the following semester and/or by their ALBERT registration appointment dates.       International Students    Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/EXPOS-UA 0009 (International Writing Workshop I/International Writing Workshop II) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. Those who fail will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Language Placement Examinations    Entering undergraduate students take proficiency examinations prior to their first registration. These examinations are administered to incoming students during orientation. The results of these examinations do not exempt students from taking these courses but assist in determining the appropriate level of courses in these areas.    Mathematics    All students must meet with their academic adviser to discuss the mathematics/quantitative reasoning requirement as listed on your program of study.    Academic Options    Change Of Major/Program of Study    Undergraduate students who are changing their major but remaining in the School must complete an official undergraduate Change of Major form, available from the Assistant Director of Advisement and Registration Services, Pless Hall, 2nd Floor. Students who are transferring from the Steinhardt School to another division in New York University must apply to transfer through the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor. See more information on internal transfers . These students are also reminded to complete an exit interview in the Office of Counseling and Student Services, Pless Hall, 2nd Floor.    Adding or Dropping Courses (Change Of Program Form)    Departmental Academic Advisement is provided to help students understand academic program requirements and to assist them with course selection. By approval and signature, the adviser holds the responsibility for students' program requirements and course selection and attests to the courses selected as meeting degree requirements. Without adviser approval, courses added or dropped may be considered as not meeting degree requirements.    No change in course schedule is valid unless it is reported to the Office of the University Registrar, the School's Office of Registration Services, and the Office of the Bursar on the required forms. Change of Program forms may be obtained from the program adviser or from the Office of Registration Services, Pless Hall, 2nd Floor.    Students are permitted to add to their program during the first two weeks of regular classes. A student wishing to add an additional course to the program during the third week of classes must have the approval of the instructor. Beyond the end of the third week of classes, a student may not add a course.    Students may withdraw formally from a course during the first three weeks of the fall or spring term or within the first three days of any summer session without having that course appear on the transcript. If a student withdraws formally from a course from the beginning of the fourth week through the ninth week of the fall or spring term, the course will be recorded on the transcript with a grade of W. A student may not withdraw from a course after the ninth week of the fall or spring term or the last week of any summer session.    View the University Refund Schedule and Policies    Independent Study    Independent study requires a minimum of 45 hours of work per credit. Independent study cannot be used to satisfy the required 60 credits in liberal arts courses, nor can it be applied to the established professional educational sequence in teaching.    Each departmental program has established its own maximum credit allowance for independent study as part of its specialization. This information may be obtained from the academic adviser. Each student is permitted to enroll for an additional 1&ndash;6 credits of independent study outside the area of specialization. Independent study is open only to matriculated students.    Prior to registering for independent study, students should obtain an Independent Study Approval form from their adviser. When completed, this form must be submitted to the Student Services Center, 25 West 4th Street, 1st Floor.    Pass/Fail Option    Matriculated graduate and undergraduate students have the option to take courses on a pass/fail basis, the maximum of such courses not to exceed 25 percent of their total program or as specified by their department/program. This pass/fail option can be applied to E, V, or C courses. Once this option is chosen, the decision cannot be changed, nor will the letter grade be recorded. Pass/fail must be requested before the end of the fifth week of classes during the Fall and Spring semesters, and by the fifth day of summer sessions.    Off-Campus Study    Permission to study in an institution outside of New York University may be obtained for graduate students in the Office of Graduate Studies and for undergraduates from the Assistant Director of Advisement and Registration Services, Pless Hall, 2nd Floor.    Graduate students must earn a grade of B or better for these credits to apply toward graduate degree requirements.    Undergraduate students enrolled for degree programs at New York University are expected to take their courses, including those taken during the summer sessions, at New York University. Exceptions will be considered by the Assistant Director of Advisement and Registration Services and referred to the dean on a case-by-case basis. Unless written approval is received in advance of such registration, transfer credit will not be granted.    Undergraduate students requesting permission to enroll in off-campus courses must submit an Off-Campus Permission form, approved by their academic adviser. These forms may be obtained from the program adviser, from the Assistant Director of Advisement and Registration Services or online .    NOTE:       Off-campus courses must be degree-bearing courses measured in semester hours.    Off-campus courses must be taken at an institution accredited by a regional accrediting association, such as the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.    Off-campus courses may not be taken at a community college.    Undergraduates must earn a grade of C or better (no credit is awarded for grades of C- and below) to apply these credits toward degree requirements.    Upon successful completion of off-campus courses, students must request that an official transcript be sent to New York University, the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, Assistant Director of Advisement and Registration Services, Pless Hall, 82 Washington Square East, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10003-6680.       Full-Time Equivalency Credit    Equivalency credits can be granted only to students who are working on:       Fulfilling a required master's internship/clinical practice    Writing a master's thesis or preparing a final experience    Preparing for a doctoral candidacy examination    A doctoral dissertation topic    A doctoral dissertation proposal    Doctoral dissertation research       The University defines full-time course work as a minimum of 12 credits each term and half-time equivalency as 6 credits each semester. Students who request full-time equivalency cannot be employed full-time and are expected to spend no fewer than 40 hours per week on a combination of course work and/or relevant items as listed above; half-time students are required to spend a minimum of 20 hours per week on course/relevant items. A student is not eligible for equivalency if he or she is not registered for any credit-bearing course work; therefore, student registered for a leave of absence, maintenance of matriculation, or only zero credit courses cannot be granted equivalency.    Equivalency applies only to state (TAP), federal (Stafford), private bank loans, veteran's benefits and visa status. Scholarships are based on the actual number of enrolled credits, and equivalency credits do not apply. The Office of Financial Aid reserves the right to adjust any financial aid package.    International students with F-1 and J-1 visas must maintain full-time (12 credit) programs during the fall and spring semesters and are eligible for equivalency if they fulfill any of the requirements listed above. International students who wish to pursue part-time study for any other reason must do so through the Office of International Students and Scholars at 561 LaGuardia Place.    Academic Responsibilities/Rights    Academic Standing    Unless otherwise stated by departmental/program criteria, in order to remain in satisfactory academic standing, graduate and undergraduate students in the School must maintain the following minimum standards:       Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum scholastic index of 2.0.    Master's degree candidates must maintain a minimum scholastic index of 2.5.    Sixth-year and doctoral students must maintain a minimum scholastic index of 3.0.       Some department/program requirements may be higher than the School minimum. Please check with your adviser if you have questions.    The Committee on Student Progress meets regularly to review transcripts of students who have not maintained a satisfactory average and to take appropriate action in each case. The options include warning the student, placing the student on probation, and dismissing the student from the School.    Students with 6 or more credits of I (incomplete) grades within a semester are also subject to the committee's review.    For a complete list of policies and procedures relating to academic progress, students should contact their academic adviser or the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs.    Computing Grade Point Average       A = 4.0 points    A- = 3.7 points    B+ = 3.3 points    B =3.0 points    B- = 2.7 points    C+ = 2.3 points    C = 2.0 points    C- = 1.7 points    D+ = 1.3 points    D = 1.0 points    F = 0.0 points       Note: There are no A+, D-, or F+ grades. P (pass), N (no credit), and I (incomplete) grades are not counted in the average. In order to compute the grade point average, add the total number of points completed with the grade of A. Do the same for the total points completed for each other grade. Multiply each of those totals by the appropriate point value of the grade.             Total credits of A    =    8    Multiplied by 4.0    =    32.0          Total credits of A-    =    4    Multiplied by 3.7    =    14.8          Total credits of B+    =    4    Multiplied by 3.3    =    13.2          Total 1    =    16    Multiplied by 4.0    =    32.0             Divide total 2 by total 1 for the grade point average: 3.75.    Leaves of Absence    An official leave of absence indicates that a student has been granted permission to maintain matriculation without registering for course work. A leave of absence and an extension to a leave of absence, as well as a return from a leave of absence, are requested through the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and require adviser approval. All requests for health-related leaves of absence must be accompanied by appropriate documentation. A leave may be granted for up to a maximum of two semesters (fall and spring). Students on a leave of absence are not eligible for University housing or the use of University facilities during the period of the leave. A leave of absence must be requested prior to the start of the semester in which the leave is to be taken. Leaves of absence are not granted after the third week of the semester.    A request for a leave of absence after the third week of the semester will be reviewed on an individual basis by the Director of Counseling and Student Services, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Leaves of absence adhere to the University's refund schedule and may affect academic progress, financial aid, graduation deadlines, housing status, and/or visa requirements. Students should review such issues with a counselor during the leave interview, with their academic adviser, and/or by contacting the appropriate office.    Students taking a leave must also fill out the withdrawal from on the Registrar's website .    Maintenance of Matriculation    To maintain matriculation in a baccalaureate degree, master's degree or advanced certificate program, a candidate is required to complete at New York University, under the auspices of the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, at least one course each academic year or, in lieu of such completion, to pay a maintenance fee of $300.00 per academic year plus a non-returnable registration and services fee. All course requirements must be completed within 10 years at the baccalaureate and 6 years at the master's/advanced certificate from the date of matriculation. Continuous maintenance of matriculation is required.    Doctoral students are not eligible for maintenance of matriculation and must register for course work or the 1-credit Doctoral Advisement (DCADV-GE 3400 or the department equivalent.)    Majors, Minors, And Double Majors    Minors    Academic programs at Steinhardt are designed to provide students with a broad understanding of the world at large while preparing them for a specific career. Steinhardt offers a series of minors to help students increase their knowledge in a particular field other than their major, gain skills that suit both their needs and aspirations, and explore individual interests. These include studio art, communication studies, educational theatre, music, nutrition and food studies, and teacher education. Steinhardt students may also pursue minors offered by the College of Arts and Science, the Stern School of Business, Tisch School of the Arts and the School of Social Work.    General Information and Instructions: You may complete your undergraduate degree with an academic major and a second field of lesser specialization, an academic minor. Like the major, a completed minor will be listed on your transcript. A minor consists of a minimum of 16 credits, with the actual number of credits and grades to be determined by the faculty in the program in which the minor is elected.    If you wish to undertake a minor, you should see the faculty advisers for permission and for information concerning courses required to complete the minor in other areas of specialization. The declaration consists of completing a form that names the minor field, lists the courses that count toward the minor, and includes the signatures of the student, the faculty adviser, the program director of the minor department, and Steinhardt's Office of Student Affairs.    Please Note: A minor can be declared at any time prior to the completion of 96 credits.    Students may be allowed to use courses counting toward the satisfaction of liberal arts requirements as credits toward the liberal arts minor. It is important when \"double counting\" that you keep in mind that the minimum number of credits required for the baccalaureate degree is 128 credits.    Courses taken for the minor can be allocated to the \"unrestricted liberal arts\" and/or \"unrestricted electives\" areas.    Courses credited toward the minor may not be credited toward the major. That is, you may not use major/specialization credits to satisfy \"minor\" requirements.    Get the Minor Declaration form online . You can also obtain the form at the Office of Undergraduate Advisement and Registration Services, Joseph and Violet Pless Hall, 82 Washington Square East, 2nd floor, 212-998-9053.    Double Majors    Subject to the approval of the adviser and all departments concerned, students may declare double majors in most programs of the Steinhardt School or the College of Arts and Science. Since courses used to satisfy the requirements for one major may not be used for another, a double major will add extra semesters to the matriculation period.    Get the Double Major Declaration form online . You can also obtain the form from the Assistant Director of Advisement and Registration Services, Pless Hall, 2nd Floor.    Grades of \"Incomplete\"    Under exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the course instructor, an \"incomplete pass\" (IP) or an \"incomplete fail\" (IF) grade may be granted, based on the student's performance throughout the course of the semester. The length of the contract period is fixed by the instructor but will be no longer than six months after the close of the semester. If outstanding work has not been completed by the end of the agreed-on time period, an IP becomes an N (no credit) and an IF becomes an F. If the contract has been completed in a timely manner, it will be considered, along with the remainder of course performance, in determining the student's earned grade. No extension will be granted beyond the \"end of contract\" date.    External Transfer Credit    The Office of Undergraduate Admissions issues a Statement of Transfer Credit to all matriculated transfer students. This details the requirements for the student's degree and shows credit granted for course work taken at other institutions. The total number of credits required for our School's baccalaureate degrees varies by program, but the minimum number is 128 credits.    The incoming transfer student may transfer up to 72 credits from previous institutions. Each academic program of study reserves the right to determine the level and number of courses that are acceptable. Of the remaining courses required for their degree programs, students must complete a minimum of 32 credits taken in residence under the auspices of the Steinhardt School. Grades of C or better (no credit is awarded for grades of C-) must have been earned in transfer courses in order to be applied toward degree requirements. In those institutions where a grade of C is the lowest passing grade, then one full grade above the lowest passing mark, a grade of B, may be considered transferable. The lowest passing grade from other institutions will not be considered for transfer credit.    Any request for revision of the final official Statement of Transfer Credit should be directed to the Assistant Director of Advisement and Registration Services, Pless Hall, 2nd Floor. Such appeals must be made within six months of the date of the \"final\" ratings from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Students are held responsible for requirements established at the time of their entrance. The statement sheet should be used by the student and his or her adviser when planning a program of study.    Consult the Office of Graduate Studies for information on graduate ratings.    Readmission Procedure    An undergraduate student who has not completed at least one 3-credit course each year under the auspices of the Steinhardt School or, in lieu of such completion, has not paid a maintenance of matriculation fee of $300 plus registration and services fees must, if he or she wishes to return to the School, contact the Office of Student Affairs, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, New York University, 82 Washington Square East, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10003-6680.       Students who have attended another college or university since attending the Steinhardt School and who have done so without permission to take courses elsewhere must complete the regular Application for Undergraduate Admission, pay the $65 application fee and submit an official transcript. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions may require additional testing at the University for those with interrupted education. Applications should be submitted well in advance of the following deadlines: April 1 for the Fall term, November 1 for the Spring term, and April 1 for the Summer term.    Students who have not attended another college or university and who have been out of school for a consecutive two-year period must file the special readmission application and a personal statement describing their activities while away from the School with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York University, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. Although readmission decisions are based primarily on the applicant's previous academic record, other factors will be considered. Students may contact the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs for more information.    Students who have been out of school for less than a consecutive two-year period and who have not attended another college or university, must remit the maintenance of matriculation fee. Enrollment in prior year maintenance of matriculation requires the approval of the program adviser and the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Students should schedule an appointment with their adviser and proceed accordingly.       The Senior Check Sheet    The Senior Check Sheet (for undergraduates who have earned 90 credits or more) is issued automatically by the Office of the University Registrar Graduation Services. A list of new seniors is printed twice per semester, including the Summer term. The check sheet is then prepared and mailed to students and their departments. Students and advisers may review and check off the courses listed under the Remaining Requirements column, as students are advised and cleared for registration.    Check sheets are issued only once and should be updated by the students and advisers as courses are completed. Students who have misplaced their original Senior Check Sheet should be given a copy from the departmental advisement file, or they may request a duplicate by calling the Graduation Services office at 212- 998-4260. Please request the duplicate several days before your advisement appointment. Students who become seniors while \"in-between lists\" because of changes of incomplete grades or award of additional transfer credit, or who have changed their major, may call 212-998-4260 to request an updated Senior Check Sheet.    Graduating Seniors: The Senior Check Sheet indicates which of the remaining requirements you must meet to be eligible for graduation. At the beginning of the term in which you will complete 90 credits, you can expect to receive your Senior Check Sheet by mail from the University Registrar. If you have not received your Senior Check Sheet by mid-November, request a copy from graduation@nyu.edu .    Review your Senior Check Sheet carefully before you register for your final semester. If there is an error, contact Linda Chin, Assistant Director, Undergraduate Advisement and Registration Services, at 212-998-5053 or linda.chin@nyu.edu ; or Belkis Baez, Student Adviser, at 212-998-9031, belkis.baez@nyu.edu . You may also schedule an appointment at 82 Washington Square East, 2nd Floor by calling 212-998-5065. In order to resolve your question, please be sure to bring your Senior Check Sheet with you.    Substitution of Required Courses    An undergraduate student who requests substitution of a required course must file an undergraduate Substitution Form (approved by the adviser, the program adviser, and by the department chair) with the Assistant Director of Advisement and Registration Services, Pless Hall, 2nd Floor.    Transcripts/Permanent Records    A copy of the student's academic record is available to the student each semester and summer session via Albert request. A copy is also sent to the student's academic adviser. The transcript/permanent record lists only those courses in which credit is earned toward the Steinhardt School degree. Advanced standing from previous schools will appear in numerical points only (no letter grades are recorded).    More information about requesting an official transcript.    Withdrawal from School    Students who are withdrawing from the Steinhardt School, either to transfer to another school of NYU or as part of a complete withdrawal from NYU, must complete the exit interview through the Office of Student Services, Pless Hall, 2nd Floor.    Students taking a leave must also fill out the withdrawal from on the Registrar's website .    Other Information    VI. Student Complaint Procedure       A. Students whose complaints relate to academic or nonacademic matters and who seek a review of their complaints should follow the procedures outlined below within six months from the time the action occurred and/or the grade was posted. If a student has exhausted the School's procedures for student complaints and believes that the School's procedure and/or process for receiving the complaint were not implemented as set forth in the Steinhardt School Student Complaint Procedure, he/she may also seek consultation through the ombudsperson. The ombudsperson, a tenured professor who is elected by students, attempts to achieve equitable resolutions to student complaints by ensuring that processes and procedures are followed.    It is recommended that student complaints begin with the person against whom the complaint is being made. If the issue involves the instructor of a course, the complaint is with the instructor. The student shall first contact the instructor and attempt to resolve the complaint. Pertinent documentation should accompany the complaint.    If the complaint is not resolved at the level of the instructor, the student should schedule an appointment with the program director, the next level for the review of complaints.    If the complaint is not resolved at the level of the program director, the next level of appeal is the department chair. The department chair, at his or her discretion, may call a meeting of the instructor, the program director, and the student. If resolution of the complaint is achieved at either stage two or three, the program director or department chair, respectively, will send a confirmatory memo to all those who have been involved.       If there is no satisfactory resolution of the student complaint at the departmental level in the judgment of the student or if the nature of the complaint involves a personal or confidential matter, the student may proceed as follows:    The student may bring the complaint to the attention of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. The Associate Dean is responsible for administering the student complaint procedure and may, when appropriate, make recommendations for the resolution of student complaints.    As a final level of appeal, the student may request a review of the complaint by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, who may then refer it to the Dean of the Steinhardt School.          Student Discipline Within the Steinhardt School       School Jurisdiction Policies on Student Discipline within the School work in tandem with University Policies and Procedures that inform student conduct, academic regulations and established practices. Thus, in its work, the Committee on Discipline is concerned with the development and welfare of each student as well as for the welfare and standards of the School. Areas of school disciplinary jurisdiction include the following:    Violation of Academic Integrity, e.g. cheating, plagiarism, and forgery of academic documents.    Disruption of the academic process and/or academic facilities, including interference with access to facilities and disruption of the classroom.    Library violations, including failure to return books or destruction of library materials.    Physical detention or restraint of a student, instructor, staff member, or administrator while that person is attempting to exercise his/her duties.       Informal Resolution When a charge of misconduct is reported, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, in cooperation with the relevant parties including the student(s), shall try to resolve the matter on an informal basis, e.g. without convening a panel/hearing.    Committee on Student Discipline    If the matter cannot be resolved accordingly, the Associate Dean will convene the Committee on Discipline, which will conduct a hearing to review the facts and related evidence/information, make a determination as to the responsibility of the student for violations of school/university policies, and impose sanctions as deemed appropriate.    Composition. The Committee on Discipline is composed of ad hoc committees as the number of cases warrant. Each ad hoc committee will be composed of two full-time faculty members, two undergraduate students, and two graduate students. The Director of Counseling and Student Services serves as an ex officio member.       Initiating Disciplinary Proceedings    Any member of the faculty, administration, or staff or any student may file disciplinary complaints against any student(s) for violation(s) of University rules of conduct and/or policies of the Steinhardt School with the Associate Dean. Notification will include names of parties, dates, a description of circumstances leading to the action, and any other pertinent information.    After receiving the complaint, the Associate Dean will convene the committee (see section C.2. above), assemble requisite materials, and schedule a hearing date.    Notification to the Student. The Student about whom a disciplinary complaint is filed will be notified by the Associate Dean in writing by registered mail and/or electronic mail, with returned receipt requested. The student will be told of the specific charges brought against him/her, including the name of person making the charge; the date, location, and circumstances on which the action is based; the place and date set for the hearing; and the procedures that will govern the hearing.       Conduct of the Hearing Hearings will be as concise as possible within the purposes of each hearing and the overall policy of the committee.    Student. When a student is asked to appear before the committee, the student may seek the counsel of his/her academic adviser or faculty member of the student's choice. The student may ask his/her academic adviser or faculty member to appear on his/her behalf during the hearing. The student may consult with the faculty member at any time during the hearing. At its discretion, the committee may ask the faculty member for pertinent comments.    Committee. The committee will select from among itself a chair, who will read the charges to the student and ask the student to respond to the allegation(s). The student may at this time offer an explanation pertaining to the charges. Committee members may direct questions to the student and other individuals present at the hearings. In the conduct of the hearing, the chair will rule on and/or determine whether to allow questions of relevancy and admissibility of evidence. However, the chair may at his/her discretion call for a vote of the committee on specific questions of relevancy and admissibility.    Committee Decision. After the hearing, the committee will meet in closed session to vote. Each committee member has one vote. A vote shall first be taken on the whether the charge is sustained. If a finding is sustained, a vote will be taken on the sanctions to be imposed. A decision will be determined by majority vote. If there is some doubt about the facts of the situation, the final decision may be deferred to a second meeting of the committee.    Sanctions. In all cases, the Committee's decisions shall be discretionary, and shall include what entry shall be made on the student record, and may include any one or more of the following sanctions: (1) exoneration (no action); (2) warning; (3) censure; (4) disciplinary probation; (5) restitution; (6) monetary fine; (7) suspension; or (8) dismissal.    Notification of Decisions. The chair will inform the student by registered mail of the findings of the committee within seven days from the date on which the decision is made. The student will also be informed of his/her right to appeal the decision to the Committee to Hear Student Appeals. The Associate Dean will be informed of the decisions made by the committee.    Written Record. As soon after the hearing as possible, the committee will prepare a written record of the hearing including the following:    The date and place of the hearing;    Names of members present;    A short statement of charges;    A summary of findings of facts and conclusions made by the committee;    A statement of any action imposed by the committee.       Committee Files. The Committee will maintain a file of information related to each case that is heard, including a record of the decision reached. All committee information about each student will be destroyed upon that student's graduation or earlier if so deemed.             Right of Student Appeal    The student has the right to appeal on the grounds that the decision or the proceedings at the hearing were arbitrary or unfair. Any appeal must be requested within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date on which the final report of the hearing body was sent to the student. The appeal shall be taken by the filing of written notice requesting an appeal with the Committee to Hear Student Appeals, following the same guidelines for disciplinary committee selection.       Composition. The Committee on Student Appeals is composed of ad hoc committees as the number of cases warrant. Each ad hoc committee will be composed of two fulltime faculty members, two undergraduate students, and two graduate students. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs serves as an ex officio member.    Conduct of the Appeal. The appeals process shall not consist of a new hearing, and shall be limited to a review of the report of and proceedings before the hearing body. The appeals committee may accept the report without modification; accept the report but reduce the sanction(s) imposed; dismiss one or more of the charges entirely; or remand the case for further proceedings. When the Committee to Hear Student Appeals accepts the report, the matter shall be deemed finally decided without further recourse as of right.    New Evidence. Discovery of evidence not previously available, which may have had a substantial bearing on the decision rendered may require the hearing body to reconsider the case.    A student who has been suspended and who is found \"not guilty\" shall be allowed full opportunity to make up whatever work was missed due to the suspension.    No record of the disciplinary proceeding will be entered in the student's file unless a final disciplinary sanction is found to be warranted.
