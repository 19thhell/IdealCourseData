This ensures that each student has an experienced educator who will oversee his or her education during the clerkship. Each Firm is named in honor of distinguished figures in the history of the Department of Medicine of the School of Medicine. Each Firm is led by a Firm Chief responsible for overseeing the progress of the educational program during the clerkship. Please see the next pages of the report for the table describing the individual Firms.   The Firm Chiefs share teaching ideas and coordinate changes in the curriculum with the Clerkship Director and the Associate Chair of Medicine during the monthly Education Council Meetings. They also serve as ongoing resources to the faculty and students, directing educational strategy and providing personal mentoring for the remainder of the students' medical school career. Additionally, Firm Chiefs write the first draft of the Chair\u2019s Letter of Recommendation for students applying for residency training in medicine. C21 implementation has had a large impact on the Department's educational efforts.   The following is a list of the Firms and their current Chiefs:    Firm Name   Firm Chief   Saul J.

This ensures that each student has an experienced educator who will oversee his or her education during the clerkship. Each Firm is named in honor of distinguished figures in the history of the Department of Medicine of the School of Medicine. Each Firm is led by a Firm Chief responsible for overseeing the progress of the educational program during the clerkship. Please see the next pages of the report for the table describing the individual Firms.   The Firm Chiefs share teaching ideas and coordinate changes in the curriculum with the Clerkship Director and the Associate Chair of Medicine during the monthly Education Council Meetings. They also serve as ongoing resources to the faculty and students, directing educational strategy and providing personal mentoring for the remainder of the students' medical school career. Additionally, Firm Chiefs write the first draft of the Chair\u2019s Letter of Recommendation for students applying for residency training in medicine. C21 implementation has had a large impact on the Department's educational efforts.   The following is a list of the Firms and their current Chiefs:    Firm Name   Firm Chief   Saul J.
