Generally, as you progress through the curriculum and learn more fundamental engineering science, your courses will involve more design components and more complex design problems.   Design elements are integral to many courses, which lead to the senior process-design courses. In these courses, you will design chemical and biomolecular processes that must include engineering, safety, and economic considerations. To see what your 4-year schedule of classes might look like if you pursued this degree, visit the Typical Course Schedule page.   Degree Requirements   In addition to the Institute requirement of a 2.0 GPA or better for graduation, you also must meet the department&rsquo;s academic standards in order to receive your degree. If you want to take senior-year courses, you must maintain a 2.5 GPA in the following courses, and you cannot fail the same course twice:   2.00 Credits Introduction to Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering CBE-UY 1002 This course introduces the chemical and biomolecular engineering profession, its history and its career potential.

Analytical and computer techniques are emphasized. Prerequisites: CBE-UY 3153, CBE-UY 3313. 3.00 Credits Transport II CBE-UY 3323 The course expands understanding in mass transfer, establishes fundamental concepts in heat transfer, and introduces engineering aspects of transport. Topics in Mass Transfer include diffusion-limited reactions with applications in biomolecular systems, transport in porous media, and mass transfer across membranes with applications in chemical and biomolecular systems. Topics in Heat Transfer include the basic mechanisms of conduction and convection. Topics in engineering aspects of transport include flow in closed conduits, heat-transfer equipment, and examples of simultaneous Heat and Mass Transfer. Prerequisite: CBE-UY 3313.
