Any 8 units (or more) of course work in a single foreign language will count as one of the two electives for the co-major/concentration. Note: Students may also take any 6-credit intensive language course (e.g. FREN-UA 10, Intensive Elementary French I) to satisfy this requirement.   Non-foreign Language  In general, a non-business elective is one that has some significant impact on business practices of the 21st century. The undergraduate faculty adviser evaluates courses for appropriateness. To request a course evaluation, the international business undergraduate adviser would need to receive the syllabus of the course, in-person or via e-mail, and a description of the request. Applicable courses may, but are not limited to, be offered through the College of Arts and Science , Wagner Graduate School of Public Service , and Tisch School of the Arts .
