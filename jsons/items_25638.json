Within in a comparative perspective we will consider the diverse sources & modes of representation, including American travelers\u2019 exoticizing accounts of the \u201cHoly Land,\u201d early Zionist utopianist narratives, Palestinian documentarist photography & contemporary historicizing anthologies of past images. We will study the ways images of maps, landscapes, archeological sites, villages, cities, houses, & communities have come to constitute a kind of visual archive that both document the past & serves as \u201cevidence\u201d for specific historical narratives. In recent photographic anthologies, historical texts, tourist guidebooks, memoirs, novels, as well as in documentary & fictional films, such visual material prior to the partition of Palestine has played an important role in the battle over representation. In context of partition & displacement, we will argue, dominant & counter media also play in defining national identity & communal belonging. Rather than taking for granted such notions as \u201cseeing is believing\u201d & \u201cimages do not lie,\u201d we will address the complex relationship between image & word, & between text & context. The seminar will be organized around key concepts & questions having to do with the orientalist imaginary, national allegory, & diasporic narratives.

The purpose of this doctoral course, \u201cSpecial Topics in Critical Theory: Marx,\u201d is to read key works by Marx, supplemented by some contemporary texts in western Marxist political theory, with the ultimate goal of understanding the various political & philosophical debates with which these texts engage. The course emphasizes Marxism as as a political theory, but will also address Marxism as a scholarly methodology for critique applicable to disciplines beyond political theory. Some attention is given to the so-called cultural turn in twentieth-century Marxist thought, including Marx's influence on feminism, identity, representation, & visual culture. Themes include: the commodity, alienation & reification, surplus value, ideology, consumerism, subjectivity, postfordism, community, & communism.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

It will center on understanding how cultural hegemony is attained, but how established norms are subverted & challenged, particularly along political & cultural fronts. Examples will be drawn from the contemporary United States, France & other countries, including global social justice movements. A variety of media formats will be reviewed, from film & print media, to social media, to protest & occupation.

We will examine a range of forms of mediated production & consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, & cultural power, & situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, & hybridity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.

Focuses on case studies of the supranational regional players in some of the most important geo-linguistic world markets, where the tensions between global/transnational media flows & local interests are most evident, engaging with theoretical positions ranging from critiques of the homogenizing effects of globalization to those that affirm the changing power relations of counter-flows based on audience preferences.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1306            Transnational Media Flows           This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres & geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global & regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel & how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political & social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, & global media markets as a struggle for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cultural & political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), & popular culture (films, tele novels, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs & films.

In recent photographic anthologies, historical texts, tourist guidebooks, memoirs, novels, as well as in documentary & fictional films, such visual material prior to the partition of Palestine has played an important role in the battle over representation. In context of partition & displacement, we will argue, dominant & counter media also play in defining national identity & communal belonging.

Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning & on the ?inscription? of space. How do people, through, their practices & their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world & the build environment)? How do they attach meanings to spaces to create places? & how do the experiences of inhabiting viewing & hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performance memories & habits? Course themes include; mapping & the imagination; vision & space, soundscape, architecture & landscape; new media & space/time compression; space & identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

The purpose of this doctoral course, \u201cSpecial Topics in Critical Theory: Marx,\u201d is to read key works by Marx, supplemented by some contemporary texts in western Marxist political theory, with the ultimate goal of understanding the various political & philosophical debates with which these texts engage. The course emphasizes Marxism as as a political theory, but will also address Marxism as a scholarly methodology for critique applicable to disciplines beyond political theory. Some attention is given to the so-called cultural turn in twentieth-century Marxist thought, including Marx's influence on feminism, identity, representation, & visual culture. Themes include: the commodity, alienation & reification, surplus value, ideology, consumerism, subjectivity, postfordism, community, & communism.

The aim of this particular course is to chart the history of how consumerism has been theorized since the nineteenth century, & to make clear the connections between the literature on consumerism/consumption & the literature on visual consumption & the relationship of modernity & visuality. The course will thus trace an arc from the literature on nineteenth century practices of visual consumption & the rise of consumer society to contemporary debates about the relationship of consumerism to philanthropy, neoliberalism & global capitalism, & theories of cultural resistance in the context of new media practices.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

We begin with an overview of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, distributed communications networks, & theories of postmodernity. Next, we examine the rise of immaterial labor in the service economies & the extension of codified labor practices into the realm of daily life. The seminar will also consider the ramifications of informatic capture & the formation of coded objects & bodies. Finally, we explore networked struggle &, through it, a political theory of the present moment. The course will favor both close readings of specific technologies as well as social & cultural claims about the information age.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

It will center on understanding how cultural hegemony is attained, but how established norms are subverted & challenged, particularly along political & cultural fronts. Examples will be drawn from the contemporary United States, France & other countries, including global social justice movements. A variety of media formats will be reviewed, from film & print media, to social media, to protest & occupation.

Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2384            Topics in Globalization: Cultural Globalization in France           Course provides students with a critical understanding of how international flows of information & entertainment products \u2013 from news & information to movies, television & lifestyle brands -- play a role in shaping & reshaping global economic, political, military, & cultural realities. We will examine a range of forms of mediated production & consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, & cultural power, & situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, & hybridity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.

Course Page               45    4            MCC-GE 2167            Transnational Media Flows           Analyzes the global flow of media products, in particular the circulation of television & film in transnational contexts, at the intersection of political economy (economic, business, & institutional frameworks) with cultural economy (the cultural meanings of these television & film products). Focuses on case studies of the supranational regional players in some of the most important geo-linguistic world markets, where the tensions between global/transnational media flows & local interests are most evident, engaging with theoretical positions ranging from critiques of the homogenizing effects of globalization to those that affirm the changing power relations of counter-flows based on audience preferences.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1306            Transnational Media Flows           This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres & geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global & regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel & how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political & social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, & global media markets as a struggle for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cultural & political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), & popular culture (films, tele novels, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs & films.

Students examine work in the philosophy & social study of technology to understand the rich & sometimes troubling relationship between values & technical design. Course will ask: Is technology neutral? Who should make key decisions? What is the role of scientists & engineers? The course examines specific cases, such as, the Internet, search engines, web-cookies, & data mining from philosophical, empirical, & technical perspectives.

Students will come to understand how technological innovation, regulatory bodies, advertisers, network heads, creative producers, audiences have interacted with economic, social, & political forces to shape television over time. In this class we will also discuss the methodological practices & concerns involved in the writing of media histories & specifically the history of broadcasting.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1347            A Cultural History of the Screen: From the Cinematic to the Handheld           Whether large, small, wide, high-definition, public, personal, shared, or handheld, screens are one of the most pervasive technologies in everyday life. From spaces of work to spaces of leisure, screens are sites for collaboration, performance, surveillance, & resistance. This course traces the cultural history of screens from a range of forms - from the panorama to the cinema, from the radar system to the television, & from the terminal to the mobile device - to provide a way of thinking about the development of the screen as simultaneously architectural, material, representational & computational.      Course Page               45    4            MCC-GE 2155            Activist Art and Creative Activism           The course will focus on the tactical, strategic, & organizational uses of artistic aesthetic taken up by the activist for the purpose of social change.

We explore a range of histories, archeologies & ethnographies of sound & listening, as it intersects with topics in media studies, science & technology studies, political economy & musicology. How has our experience of sound changed as we move from the piano to the personal computer, from the phonoautograph to the mp3? How have political, commercial, & cultural forces shaped what we are able to listen to, & how we listen to it? Finally, how have performers, physiologists, acousticians, engineers & philosophers worked to understand this radical transformation of the senses?

Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning & on the ?inscription? of space. How do people, through, their practices & their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world & the build environment)? How do they attach meanings to spaces to create places? & how do the experiences of inhabiting viewing & hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performance memories & habits? Course themes include; mapping & the imagination; vision & space, soundscape, architecture & landscape; new media & space/time compression; space & identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

The purpose of this doctoral course, \u201cSpecial Topics in Critical Theory: Marx,\u201d is to read key works by Marx, supplemented by some contemporary texts in western Marxist political theory, with the ultimate goal of understanding the various political & philosophical debates with which these texts engage. The course emphasizes Marxism as as a political theory, but will also address Marxism as a scholarly methodology for critique applicable to disciplines beyond political theory. Some attention is given to the so-called cultural turn in twentieth-century Marxist thought, including Marx's influence on feminism, identity, representation, & visual culture. Themes include: the commodity, alienation & reification, surplus value, ideology, consumerism, subjectivity, postfordism, community, & communism.

The aim of this particular course is to chart the history of how consumerism has been theorized since the nineteenth century, & to make clear the connections between the literature on consumerism/consumption & the literature on visual consumption & the relationship of modernity & visuality. The course will thus trace an arc from the literature on nineteenth century practices of visual consumption & the rise of consumer society to contemporary debates about the relationship of consumerism to philanthropy, neoliberalism & global capitalism, & theories of cultural resistance in the context of new media practices.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

We will survey the ways scholars in STS\u2014whose research methods range from historical epistemology to medical anthropology to the sociology of science\u2014have understood the natural world, technical systems, human perception, & the social order to be co-produced. Following Bruno Latour, throughout the course we will investigate \u201cmatters of fact\u201d as always \u201cmatters of concern.\u201d      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 3152            Special Topics in Technology Studies: AudioVision: Sound and Listening in Film and Other Media           This seminar examines audiovisual phenomena, placing the various senses of sound & image in opera, music theater, video (& gaming), & especially cinema in historical & theoretical contexts. The course examines a history of relationships between the senses of sight & cultural conditions for the shifting modalities of visual & sonic experience, the course attempts to interrogate the ideological stakes of this dichotomy. The course will examine the history of a lopsided dichotomy of the senses in writers ranging from Plato & Boethius via Kant & Schopenhauer to Deleuze, Derrida, & Chion.

We begin with an overview of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, distributed communications networks, & theories of postmodernity. Next, we examine the rise of immaterial labor in the service economies & the extension of codified labor practices into the realm of daily life. The seminar will also consider the ramifications of informatic capture & the formation of coded objects & bodies. Finally, we explore networked struggle &, through it, a political theory of the present moment. The course will favor both close readings of specific technologies as well as social & cultural claims about the information age.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

We will examine a range of forms of mediated production & consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, & cultural power, & situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, & hybridity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.

Course Page               45    4            MCC-GE 2167            Transnational Media Flows           Analyzes the global flow of media products, in particular the circulation of television & film in transnational contexts, at the intersection of political economy (economic, business, & institutional frameworks) with cultural economy (the cultural meanings of these television & film products). Focuses on case studies of the supranational regional players in some of the most important geo-linguistic world markets, where the tensions between global/transnational media flows & local interests are most evident, engaging with theoretical positions ranging from critiques of the homogenizing effects of globalization to those that affirm the changing power relations of counter-flows based on audience preferences.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1306            Transnational Media Flows           This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres & geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global & regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel & how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political & social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, & global media markets as a struggle for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cultural & political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), & popular culture (films, tele novels, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs & films.

Students examine work in the philosophy & social study of technology to understand the rich & sometimes troubling relationship between values & technical design. Course will ask: Is technology neutral? Who should make key decisions? What is the role of scientists & engineers? The course examines specific cases, such as, the Internet, search engines, web-cookies, & data mining from philosophical, empirical, & technical perspectives.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2450            Video Game Theory           The purpose of this class is both to provide a general introduction to the field of video game studies, & to suggest a host of divergent directions such research may take in the near future. From the phenomenology of thumbs to the ethical thickets of codes & cheats, the class will address the key questions facing game researchers today; true to the field\u2019s intent interdisciplinary nature, methodologies considered will very from ethnography to semiotic analysis. Relevant examples will be provided throughout, & no preexisting knowledge of gaming is necessary.

and Social Processes Persuasion and Politics Technology and Society              Global and Transcultural Communication        Courses examine the varied challenges posed by globalization on citizenship, diasporas, ethnic and cultural minorities, human rights, media economies of scale, the circulation and influence of cultural products, intellectual and cultural property, the structuring and stratification of information flows and social policy.                     MCC-GE 2136 - War and Media Theory   Communication studies traditionally focus on how war is propagandized by mass media. In contrast, this seminar proposes that war is an encompassing mode of political communication in which media is militarized and violence is mediatized. We will examine how modern warfare has generated new visual cultures and new media networks. This seminar proposes that the visual technology of war and the technologies of event dissemination are linked problems in the political history of representation. The triangulation of person, place and time as the basis of perceiving history can only be accounted for by a history of mediated perception-a history increasingly characterized by military technologies and military visual culture, and their fashioning of the modern sensorium. The seminar will examine the thesis that the 'informationatization' of contemporary consciousness can only be understood through a media theory of war.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2137 - Memory, Architecture and Design: Comparative Perspectiveson New York and Buenos Aires   This course compares the debates &amp; contestations over architecture&rsquo;srelationship to memory, trauma, nationalism, &amp; memorialization thathave taken place in Argentina, over the memory of its &ldquo;dirty war&rdquo; from1976-1983, and in the United States over the last three decades. Itsituates this comparative perspective within the scholarship ofarchitecture &amp; design, memory studies, &amp; visual culture.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2165 - Transnational Communities and Media Cultures   This course examines the emergence of transnational communities, recent patterns of migration, and the role of media forms and practices in redefining culture and national belonging. We will explore how media practices define culture and identity for diasporic groups within the landscape of global cities. What role do media play in the (re)imagining of cultural politics, nationalism, and everyday life in the context of global relocations? How do technology and media enable new configurations of cultural resistance and identification within ( and between) different immigrant groups? What does this mean in terms of negotiating the global and local in various aspects of immigrant lives? Through field trips, field work, discussion, and lectures, students will be exposed to contemporary issues and research.    Note: This couse may be offered in London. Consult your academic advisor for further information.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2166 - The Global City and Media Ethnography: Practice-led Transcultural Media Research   The course focuses on the theories and methods of media/sensory ethnography, visual culture, media archeology, through the linked topics of transcultural and trans-local processes, diaspora identities, the post colonial and human rights. The curriculum is aimed at graduate students from diverse disciplines who want to explore creative media practice as a research methodology. This course provides students with theoretical and practical grounding in multi-sited action research in trans-cultural and transnational settings. Through social historical and trans-cultural ethnographic perspectives practice-led pedagogy promotes a self- reflexive contextual and critical understanding of the use of media for the conduct and dissemination of research and the creation of social knowledge through participatory cultural production. Practice-Led Media Research is the theory, social history pedagogy and circulation of social science and humanities research through the production of film, video, internet, visual arts and other screen/audio based media. Practice-led research overcomes divisions between social theory and action-research, and between creative practice and evidence-based research. An important focus is the use of visual media to convey ideas and distinctive understandings about the world. There is a strong emphasis on comprehending visual phenomena in cross-cultural perspective and on the multifarious roles played by media in processes of identity and cultural formation in the world today.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2167 - Transnational Media Flows   This class will study the global landscape of media flows, particularly television and film, and its specific configurations at regional and national levels. Rooted in the idea of media as cultural industries we will identify the supranational regional players from some of the most important geo-linguistic markets around the world, where the tensions of global/transnational media and cultural audience's dynamics at local levels become more evident. We will examine the implications of these industrial/cultural dynamics from both theories that denounce the homogenizing cultural effect produce by global media, as well as approaches that underscore the rising of counter-flow trends based on audiences' preferences. sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2169 - Globalization, Memory, and Visual Culture   This course examines the intersections of global visual culture and cultural memory, with a particular focus on the tensions that arise between the largely national tendencies of cultural memory and the global circulation of cultural meaning. We will focus on the ways that the nation, colonialism, and globalization have been enacted through visual culture and cultural memory with a particular focus on France, in comparison to other national contexts.    The course provides an overview of contemporary theoretical engagements with cultural memory, visual culture, and consumerism, looking at the role played by discourses of memory in changing concepts of nation, colonialism-postcolonialism, and globalization. The course will begin by examining how cultural memory and memorialization have been deployed in the context of the nation, looking in particular at how national memory has been constructed in France. We will look at how the concept of national memory becomes contested, and the institutions through which the memory of France and the French Empire have been constructed. We will thus consider the tensions between the emerging identities of transnationalism and globalization and the traditional frameworks of national memory. How cultural memory is enacted through visual culture will be a key theme of the course, looking at memorials, museums, artistic projects, design, and architecture as central to how cultural memory is shaped. We will situate these projects in relation to the memory industry and global consumer economy, through which cultural memory is packaged, branded, and consumed. These intersections&mdash;memory, visual culture, consumerism, nationalism, colonialism, and globalization&mdash;will frame our inquiries.    This course will be an intensive three-week course in Paris, organized in collaboration with the American University of Paris. We will have a number of field trips and site visits, including the Musee Carnavalet, the Quai Branley museum of French colonialism, the Cite de l&rsquo;Immigration, and a day trip to Normandy and the World War II museum in Caen.    Note: This couse will be offered in Paris in Summer 2014. Department approval needed.

Students relate these studies to how gender, race, culture &amp; sexual orientation are developed &amp; reflected in society in both personal &amp; professional relationships.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2184 - Comparative Media Systems   How does journalism differ around the world? And to the extent that it does, why? Beyond the personal idiosyncrasies of individual journalists and media owners, which factors play the greatest role in shaping 'national news cultures': professional values and traditions, level and type of commercialism, government regulations, bureaucratic pressures or organizational dynamics, and/ or audiences? Too much of our media criticism proceeds from hunches and assumptions, rather than real evidence, for the simple reason that it limits itself to a single national context ( and often a single time period). Adequately sorting out the factors that shape our media environment can best be accomplished via comparative research. This course offers a conceptual roadmap to such a project as well as a close empirical look at the news media in a variety of national contexts. After a general consideration of the factors that structure news media systems and the roles that media play in democratic societies, the course incorporates (1) a survey of comparative methodologies: surveys, ethnographies, news content analyses, etc., and (2) national and comparative case studies, representing the major types of Western European journalistic 'models' as well as some important non-European variants.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2210 - Globalization and Gender   This course will examine how definitions of gender and sexuality are reproduced, negotiated and deployed in the context of globalization and transnational flows. We will examine key texts drawn from feminist/global cultural studies on the topics of citizenship, global labor flows, migration, militarization, neoliberalism and the construction of the gendered global subject. Through a reading of theoretical texts, ethnographic case studies and analysis of media representation, we will engage with questions of feminist epistemology and method research.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2211- Decolonization and its Aftermath   The advent of 20th century decolonization challenged the way in which world history had been conceived for four centuries, as centered upon the tiny landmass of Western Europe, rather than say, as plural and polycentric. The former view made it difficult to understand how the majority of the world's population mattered to history at all. With the onset of decolonization after the end of World War I, the world began to be seen, first through the lens of the nation, and secondly, as an extensive set of interconnections, where seemingly remote events could have major effects across countries. This course will combine a survey of select decolonization movements with analyses of the transformations from anticolonial nationalism through postcolonial developmentalism to the contemporary new world order. The course will consider decolonization in two senses: as the historical achievement of independence in former colonies, and, as a communicational concept illuminating socio-political change. sample syllabus 1    sample syllabus 2          MCC-GE 2229 - Contemporary Theory and Research in Globalization   This course seeks to cover the landscape in contemporary theorizing and research on cultural globalization. It is organized broadly around three partially competing/partially complementary theories of globalization: homogenization, enduring cultural differences, and hybridization. We will attempt to bring each of these theories to life with case studies of the production, distribution, and reception of cultural forms and experiences from across the globe.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2232 - Language and Culture    Readings and research on the ways in which language is implicated in different cultures &amp; constructions of time, space, consciousness, self, truth, knowledge, and gender. sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2275 - Middle East Media and Cultural Politics   Examines developments of culture, politics, and media in contemporary Middle East through an historical and cultural lens. Course is organized by theoretical theme and geographic location and addresses culture as a site of struggle; the impact of globalization on Arab mass media; the connections between civil society, democracy and Islam; and gender, national and diasporic identities.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2284 - Religion and Media    Bertrand Russell long ago declared that religion belonged to the infancy of human history, in a statement that expressed the secular self-understanding of an enlightened European of his time. By comparison, at least from the time of Alexis de Tocqueville, it has been clear that in a country like the United States, religious affiliation has not diminished with the advance of historical time. If anything the movement has been in a contrary direction, with religion having increased in social and political influence, with effects that reverberate across the globe today. The disparity between Continental and American perceptions reflects a failure to understand the place of religion in modern society, and to relate changes in religious practice to historical change. It is not simply in traditional, backward or disadvantaged societies that religion thrives, but in the very heart of modern society, so to speak. The legislative approach to sequester religion and keep it in its place, widely practiced, rarely has the desired results. Religion turns out to be mediated in new ways, to sacralize new forms of connection, to mark out new relations between the sacred and the profane.    Note: This couse may be offered in Paris.

Students will examine research into why and how youth createand distribute multiple media in different locales, and investigate inwhat ways these activities support the development of young people&rsquo;scapacities for 21st century skills of digital communication, criticalliteracy, civic engagement, media appreciation, and personalexpression.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2304 - Global Media and International Law    This course examines the history and role of international law and international regulatory instruments as they pertain to global media governance. It provides an historical overview of the various institutions and actors involved in global media governance, and assesses the various principles and practices that constitute the regime of global media governance, including the regulation of broadcasting, telecommunications, the Internet, and trade in media products. Students will undertake original research in a selected area of global media governance with careful attention to original documents in the field.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2305 - Internet Governance   The Internet has become an essential platform and engine for economic development, social justice and the protection of human rights. At the same time, the issue of global Internet governance raises challenging questions, including: where the control of the Internet should reside, what guiding principles should be used and who should take part in the policy making process? Students will explore prominent narratives and issues, such as the concept of architectural openness and the promotion of Internet Freedom. Through weekly discussions and the tracking of developmental shifts, this course seeks to provide insight into the possible future of the medium. Sample Syllabus          MCC-GE 2351 - Global Food Cultures    An interdisciplinary and intercultural examination of human communication through food. The course explores the social, economic, political, and cultural ramifications of the technology, production, acquisition, preservation, packaging, distribution, promotion, representation, selling, presentation, and consumption of food, as well as the disposal of food-related wastes. Students will have a unique opportunity to explore various local, regional, and transnational cuisines and food rituals in Hong Kong as the manifestation of changing social norms, economic realities, and cultural beliefs in an increasingly global and multicultural city.    Note: This couse is offered in Hong Kong. Consult your academic advisor for further information.       Sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2380 Topics in Globalization   SUBTOPIC: Cultural Globalization in France    This course will provide students with a critical understanding of how international flows of information and entertainment products &ndash; from news and information to movies, television and lifestyle brands -- play a role in shaping and reshaping global economic, political, military, and cultural realities. We will examine a range of forms of mediated production and consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, and cultural power, and situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, and hybridity.    In this intensive three-work course organized in collaboration with the American University of Paris, the city of light and its environs will be our laboratory. France is often at the center of debates about the reach and character of cultural globalization: its government has often taken the lead in opposing American efforts to define cultural exchange in purely market terms, even as French publics have often welcomed American popular culture and political ideas. To better understand globalization &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; in France, we will range across Paris to meet with activists, journalists, and other media creators. In so doing, we will deepen our understanding of the global, national, and local economic and political processes shaping how culture is being created, consumed, remixed, diffused, and transformed.    *This course is set to run in Paris in Summer 2013, June 26 - July 16. Department approval needed. More information is available here .    Syllabus available soon.          MCC-GE 2381 - Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture   Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local and inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, and shelter, and the elasticity of the relationship between bodies and things, yet its meanings and messages are globally circulated and produced. Consumption is a flash point for social and political debates about the relationship between needs and desires. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by exploring the ways in which bodies and things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, and fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation and novelty in the shaping of consumer experience in the context of globalization.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2382 - Topics in Globalization: Communication and International Development   This course introduces students to theoretical foundations in historical and contemporary issues in communication and international development. Topics include state-building, modernization, dependency and globalization, as they concern the \"Third World.\"  Part One of the course focuses on mainstream development, its proponents (such as the UN, the World Bank and international non-profit organizations) and its application and practice. Part Two will delve into the critiques of development and its connections to longer historical, political and economic inequalities, such as imperialism, colonialism and globalization. In Part Three, each class will be devoted to a particular topic or problem and relevant case studies from they key regions (Latin America/Carribean; Africa; Middle East; Asia; \"The Fourth World\") that students will present on. sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2384 - Topics in Globalization: Media and Cultural Globalization in France   This course explores common current definitions of grassroots media and their implications (e.g. 'alternative' media, 'citizens' media, 'tactical' media, 'social movement' media). It then examines a number of self-governed media projects in the USA, France and elsewhere. Examples will include Occupy movement media, media uses in the global anti-apartheid movement (1950-1994), social movement media in the Arab region, and protest media in France. Students in groups of 2-3 produce a short video concerned with social justice/cultural diversity and shorter \"on-the-spot\" videos as practices of citizen journalism. The course studio component teaches students the necessary technical skills to make critical-situational media.

By visuality, we mean the visualization of history, composed of images, ideas and the imagination. This class introduces present-day visualized globalization in historical context and offers students ways to research visual culture in the intersections between globalizations past and present. In the first half of the class, lectures and discussion trace the concept of visuality from its emergence in the 19th century to its uses in imperial regimes and the neo-visuality of the present. We consider how visuality imagines history as war, visible only to the Hero, or Great Man, and consider alternatives proposed by abolitionists, indigenous people, and the labor movement. The second half of the class will be a series of visual media-based workshops from painting and photography to film and digital media, discussing strategies and approaches to research as well as offering students the opportunity to use primary and archival materials. Students will develop a project proposal that might be developed into a thesis, article or mixed-media project. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2836 - Culture and Media in Urban China   This graduate workshop combines an interdisciplinary seminar on methods in China studies and a &ldquo;writing group&rdquo; format for graduate students developing original research on historical and contemporary formations of Chinese media and material culture: historical documents, art, photography, films, television shows, legal cases, novels, magazines, blogs and microblogs, material objects, ritual events, etc. We will read from outstanding books in China studies, including sociology, history, art history, anthropology, and media studies. Our discussion of these readings will focus on comparing methodological and analytical approaches to a range of text/objects, and contrasting forms of argument that focus on: 1) &ldquo;cosmology&rdquo; (cultures, conceptual schemes, languages, ideologies); 2) &ldquo;politics&rdquo;(conflict, difference, distinction); and 3) &ldquo;structure&rdquo; (networks and systems, kinship, clientalism, bureaucracy). Over the course of the semester students will develop analyses of their own text/objects, and use these analyses to develop journal articles, MA theses, or dissertation chapters.    sample syllabus                    This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
