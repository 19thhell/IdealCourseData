Customer experience, online communities, and social networking have created the need for PR professionals with a very different set of skills than those of their predecessors.   For the public relations industry, the greatest challenge today is the dearth of new talent\u2014the demand for PR professionals is growing faster than the talent pool. According to the Public Relations Society of America, spending on public relations increased substantially in 2010, and is forecast to go up to $8.1 billion over the next five years.       That\u2019s why the M.S in Public Relations and Corporate Communication is so critical. Through this program and its innovative curriculum, we are teaching and are graduating high-caliber students who will satisfy the increasing demand for PR professionals. These individuals must be well versed in industry trends and must be able to apply new technology and new methods of communication to develop and to implement effective public relations plans.

Customer experience, online communities, and social networking have created the need for PR professionals with a very different set of skills than those of their predecessors.   For the public relations industry, the greatest challenge today is the dearth of new talent\u2014the demand for PR professionals is growing faster than the talent pool. According to the Public Relations Society of America, spending on public relations increased substantially in 2010, and is forecast to go up to $8.1 billion over the next five years.       That\u2019s why the M.S in Public Relations and Corporate Communication is so critical. Through this program and its innovative curriculum, we are teaching and are graduating high-caliber students who will satisfy the increasing demand for PR professionals. These individuals must be well versed in industry trends and must be able to apply new technology and new methods of communication to develop and to implement effective public relations plans.
