NYU\u2019s academic center in suburban Labone offers courses in the arts, literature, communication, journalism, media, anthropology, history, politics, global public health, and sociology taught by local professors and visiting faculty from New York.   Many NYU Accra students intern and take part in community service with NGO\u2019s, local businesses, and philanthropic groups, helping them to understand social entrepreneurship in a fast-developing city. Numerous co-curricular travel opportunities introduce students to the diversity and complexity of West African culture. Whether learning Twi, the city\u2019s local dialect, or embracing local West African culture, students at NYU Accra are rewarded with an unparalleled intellectual and cultural experience.
