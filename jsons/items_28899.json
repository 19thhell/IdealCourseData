                                          Physical fitness is an important aspect of overall student development at NYU Abu Dhabi. Guided by the principle that a healthy body supports a strong mind in achieving one's full potential, the Physical Education program provides opportunities for competitive and recreational athletic participation, fitness through exercise classes such as aerobics and Pilates, and lifetime skills in sports such as golf and tennis. Students are required to complete two 7-week Physical Education sessions.   The Athletic Department promotes and enhances a healthy lifestyle by providing qualified coaches and instructors, coordinating the use of athletic facilities, overseeing the intramural program, arranging for recreational opportunities, and providing exercise classes. Students at NYUAD have the opportunity to participate in a wide range of indoor and outdoor fitness activities including popular team sports such as football/soccer, volleyball, and tennis, individual competitions such as road races and triathlons, a choice of water sports such as kayaking and sailing, and athletic leisure activities, such as cycling, hiking, and equestrian events. Many of these activities are offered as 7-week courses during fall and spring semesters, which are listed below.   While the goal is to field at least one externally competitive team per fall, winter, and spring season, the specific sports offered will depend on the interest and ability levels among students in the class. There are also opportunities for individual competition in events.

PHYED-AD 37 Total Fitness                                             Total Fitness describes its strength and conditioning program as &ldquo;constantly varied, high intensity, functional movement&rdquo;. It is a program geared to prepare the body for better fitness by not focusing on any one activity. Rather, Total Fitness wants the body prepared for any and all activities or sports. It focuses on core strengthening and conditioning. It is not the same routine every day, but a regular mixture of activities designed to activate and strengthen various core and major muscle groups from a variety of tasks. Workouts are typically short&mdash;20 minutes or less&mdash;and intense, demanding all-out physical exertion. They combine movements such as sprinting, rowing, jumping rope, climbing rope, flipping tires, weightlifting, and carrying sandbags, kettlebells etc. CrossFit has attracted elite athletes, military personnel, police officers and now regular people who want to achieve higher levels of fitness. The Total Fitness program seeks to achieve this through balance in ten fitness categories: heart and lung endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance and accuracy.

PHYED-AD 43 Corrective Excercise                                             This course is a combination of three corrective exercise methods, namely Trigger Point Therapy, Rehabilitation and Muscle Activation.  Trigger Point Therapy will relieve the muscle tightness and increase range of motion, facilitating efficient blood circulation. This actually increases energy levels, muscle strength and delays fatigue which is invaluable to the competitive athlete. The range of motion will enable you to use the full potential of the muscle and the restored muscle with improved blood supply; will be able to work harder for much longer, without tightening up on you. Essentially what this amounts to is a dramatic Improvement in your sports performance.  Rehabilitation of muscles can bring about reduced pain and accelerated healing of injured tissue, Improved range of motion and muscle mass, Strengthening, conditioning, and weight loss and better overall well-being and improved quality of life.  Muscle activation looks at the body compensations as it loses its ability to engage the prime movers of the body. These compensations reduce the ability of the body to work at its highest effectiveness, and increase the risk of injury.

PHYED-AD 44 Kettlebells                                             Kettlebells are cast iron weights shaped like a ball with a handle for easy gripping. Kettlebells offer a different kind of training using dynamic moves targeting almost every aspect of fitness &ndash; endurance, strength, balance, agility and cardio endurance. Kettlebell exercises are in their nature holistic; therefore they work several muscles simultaneously and may be repeated continuously for several minutes or with short breaks. This combination makes the exercise partially aerobic and more similar to High-intensity interval training rather than to traditional weight lifting.

PHYED-AD 47 Yoga                                             Individuals learn the basic disciplines of yoga, focusing on body awareness, appropriate warm ups, beginning yoga postures, breathing, and relaxation skills. Upon successful completion, students understand and are able to demonstrate the basic components of yoga practice, including safe, stable body alignment and classic yoga postures. Phoenix Rising Yoga (PRY) works on the assumption that the body and mind are not separate, and that physical and emotional issues are profoundly connected. As a body-based, approach to self-awareness, PRY uses assisted yoga postures accompanied by facilitative dialogue that can help you to deepen your connection to your inner experiences and open the doors to greater self-awareness. This, in turn, has the potential to facilitate the identification and practice of the next steps in your life&rsquo;s journey.

PHYED-AD 51 Aikido                                             Aikido is a Japanese martial art based on the philosophy of blending with an opponents power and redirecting their aggressiveness to a mutually safe place rather than trying to counter power with power. It is therefore not dependent on the individual&#39;s size and strength. Elements of classical Japanese sword and staff are incorporated into the empty hand techniques, which consist of throwing and pinning defenses against a wide variety of attacks. The class is open to both beginners and advanced practitioners and people of all fitness levels.  An in-house instructor will teach this course.    *Note : (Spring 2015) make up and catch-up sessions on Thursdays.
