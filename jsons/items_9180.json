This program explores innovative ways to reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental protection by recycling existing structures. The course of study combines academic training and research with experiential learning opportunities.   For additional information visit the Art History Department .

Our new collaborative two-year dual degree program combines the MA in French Language and Civilization and Advanced Certificate in Museum Studies . Students will spend their first year in Paris and the second in New York.

While in residency students participate in a vibrant community engaged in workshops, craft talks, lectures, individual conferences and manuscript consultations, a diverse series of readings, special events and professional development panels.
