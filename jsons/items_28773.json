Each participant has three minutes to present a compelling oration on the significance of their research in language appropriate for a non-specialized audience. Eligibility  Anyone who is enrolled in a GSAS master\u2019s program  Graduates of GSAS master's programs of the current academic year are also eligible      2015 The Fifth Annual GSAS Threesis Academic Challenge took place on Saturday, April 11, 2015. Students in the finals rounds of the GSAS Threesis Academic Challenge competed for prizes totaling $3,000 offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Science and a chance to claim the coveted title of Threesis Champion. Members of the audience at the final rounds voted for and awarded a $750 prize to the Threesis Audience Choice Winner. The Threesis Champion also won eligibility to present at the Falling Walls Conference in Berlin this November. You can learn more about Falling Walls at their website by clicking here . The Threesis Incentive Program allows for departments and programs to encourage student participation and support their students by offering departmental rewards of at least $300 to students who make it to the final round. To find out more, please click here .          2014 The Fourth Annual GSAS Threesis Academic Challenge took place April 12, 2014 in the Silver Center. A record number of students participated in the Qualifying Rounds vying for a spot in the Finals. Competitors presented their own research in engaging talks of three minutes or less to panels of judges comprised of faculty representing the three disciplines of the Graduate School of Arts and Science: the Humanities, the Social Sciences and Science. Faculty advanced two competitors from each of the six qualifying groups using a three\u2013part criteria: how well the competitor grasped their research, how accessible the language of the presenter was and how engaging the presenter made the three minutes. The resulting twelve finalists took the big stage in the Eisner &amp; Lubin auditorium the following day to compete for the top prizes and coveted titles. Finalists from across the GSAS disciplines engaged a full house and an esteemed finalist-judging panel composed of the Deans for the Humanities, Social Sciences and Science as they reached for the top titles. From talks ranging in topic from genome editing to marriage and politics in Elizabethan literature, the captivated audience and judges had their hands full selecting the winners. Dean Lauren Benton; Tamara Day, the President of the GSAS Master's College Alumni Association (MCAA); and the 2013 first place winner Alexsandra Mitchell presided over the awards ceremony.
