The Dental Hygiene programs at NYU College of Dentistry provide extraordinary clinical and academic opportunities for students interested in preventive oral healthcare and the promotion of good health. A key member of the healthcare team, the dental hygienist works together with the dentist to meet the oral health needs of patients and thereby improve patients' quality of life.   The Office of Allied Health Programs houses two degree programs, both of which prepare students for careers in dental hygiene: Bachelor of Science (BS) in Dental Hygiene and Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Dental Hygiene .   EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND MISSION   The mission of the New York University Dental Hygiene Programs is to partner with students to achieve academic excellence; promote scholarly activity, health promotion, disease prevention and research; to participate in community service; and to offer comprehensive client care, utilizing critical thinking and evidence-based decision making. As goals, the program will prepare a competent dental hygienist, maintain a contemporary dental hygiene program that reflects relevant and current dental hygiene practice, and provide an interdisciplinary integrated curriculum.   The NYU Advantage   Attending the only dental hygiene program housed within a dental college in the state of New York, Dental Hygiene students at the NYU College of Dentistry have the unique opportunity to work in integrated clinical settings alongside DDS students as well as faculty members from dental hygiene, dentistry and specialty areas -- gaining invaluable experiences as they learn the practice of dental hygiene while treating a highly diverse patient population. Academic excellence and clinical expertise are further supported by rotations through specialty areas (orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, implant dentistry, and pediatric dentistry), preparing students through a comprehensive and challenging education.

I want to move through the program as quickly as possible and I can go full-time.                               The two-year, three-year and three-and-a-half-year evening tracks all consist of the same (78 credit) core curriculum leading to the Associate of Applied Science degree. There are differences in the curriculum design of these tracks; for example, the two-year track is a compact, full-time credit platform requiring a two-year commitment to the program. Course loads per semester range from 18-21 credits, with courses scheduled four and a half days per week and some days ending at 6:00 pm. One evening course is included in track as well. The curriculum design for the three-year and three-and-a-half-year tracks are spread out accordingly.   Our Fast Track requires a 17-month commitment and follows the same core curriculum as the tracks above. This full-time credit platform begins in the spring semester which runs from January and continues through May of the following year. View the fast track curriculum .   The Bachelor of Science degree (128 credit) core curriculum can be completed in three to four years depending upon accepted transfer credits. You may apply to the BS degree program in all semesters with some online course availability.                                                              I missed the fall deadline and still wish to start in the spring.                               You can apply for the AAS fast track or the AAS or BS pre-requisite program that begins in the spring semester. There may be options in the three-year day program but may require advisement and modifications in registration.                                                              I have many possible transfer credits for previous colleges.                               The courses for the Associate of Applied Science and Bachelor of Science are in specific sequence. Depending upon the number of total accepted transfer credits, you may have a lighter course/credit load; however, the length of the program towards the degree still remains the same. This concept allows time to sequence the clinical experiences over four semesters.                                                              I need to go part-time.                               The three-year day curriculum extends the two-year curriculum course load by an additional academic year. Those accepted into the three-and-a-half-year evening track meet for class four nights per week with courses generally taking place between 5:00 pm and 9:50 pm (three classes in the evening program begin at 4:00 pm), and the evening curriculum requires enrollment in summer sessions. Students in this program are considered candidates for degree conferral in September instead of May. While choosing this evening track requires a longer financial commitment, many select this curriculum for work and personal lifestyle reasons.   New York University defines part-time status as fewer than 12 credits. Full-time status is defined as 12-20 credits. Although the part-time program curriculum is defined by length of time and not credit status, it is possible with advisor guidance to plan a curriculum allowing students to take courses at part-time credit status throughout their enrollment in the program. However this might require additional semesters or summer enrollment. Courses have specific time offerings, sequences and pre-requisites. The three-year day and evening programs are designed to provide students the ability to continue earning an income or manage family matters while in school.                                                              I have a dental degree from another country.                               The application process requires you to submit an official course-by-course evaluation reviewed by Educational Credential Evaluators . Courses are then considered for transfer based upon policy of time, grades, conversion of transfer credit and similar content. You can still decide which program track is best for your needs: Associate two-year, fast track, three-year day/evening or Bachelor program. The College does not yet have an advanced placement process. Depending upon the number of total accepted transfer credits, you may have a lighter course/credit load; however, the length of the program towards the degree still remains the same.                                                              I do not have the pre-requisite courses.                               Apply as a pre-requisite student and plan to register for Introduction to Biology and/or Introduction to Chemistry as needed. Upon completion of these courses with a grade of B or better, conditional acceptance can be modified allowing you selection of your choice of program and track. Our pre-requisite courses are 2 credits each. You can consider registering for additional liberal arts or writing courses to qualify for full- or part-time financial aid.                                                              I need financial aid.                               For those students who qualify, financial aid is available. Aid eligibility is determined from the data provided on your FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), TAP (Tuition Assistance Program - for NY state residents only) and the amount of aid you have used while in attendance at other higher education institutions.   NYU defines full-time as 12-20 credits and part-time or half-time as over 6 credits. To be eligible for aid, students must be registered for at least 6 credits.    Financial Aid representatives are available at the College of Dentistry to assist you with any questions or concerns.                                                              Should I apply for the AAS or four-year BS degree?                               Choosing to earn a degree in Dental Hygiene requires a major decision, significant financial commitment and a great amount of time and dedication to the program. The practice of dental hygiene comprises many work settings with varying responsibilities. The Bachelor of Science degree provides a more comprehensive education and expands opportunities for employment beyond the scope of the private practice setting to areas such as teaching, research, public health and the corporate sector.   The profession of dental hygiene is moving to Bachelor of Science entry level practice.                                                              I hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree from another institution. Why should I enroll in the AAS degree program?                               In order to become a dental hygienist, you must complete at least an Associate of Science or Associate of Applied Science degree in dental hygiene. Some of your liberal arts courses may transfer into our AAS program to lighten your academic load. You may still select from the various tracks to meet your needs.                    BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE   The Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene Program is comprised of 128 credits, which can be completed either along a &quot;typical&quot; four-year college track (Track A) or through a degree completion track (Track B). Track A is a four-year dental hygiene program which allows the student to obtain the BS degree while also receiving dental hygiene education. Track B ( degree completion ) is for students who have already completed an accredited program in dental hygiene and now wish to pursue a BS degree. Additionally, an Accelerated Track A for students with possible transfer credits is available.   All BS tracks include unique internship opportunities in specialized areas of focus, such as education, research, public health and healthcare management. Two required internships (100 hours total) must be completed and are carefully selected by the student with faculty advisement. The classes offered within these tracks are unique in that they familiarize the students with varied aspects of healthcare beyond the clinical scope of practice. In the field of dental hygiene, a BS degree will create more innovative employment opportunities within the field of dentistry and dental hygiene.                                                    Track A                               This curriculum is offered full-time and it is completed within four years. The first year curriculum includes courses in general education, basic sciences and clinical sciences. The second and third years include dental hygiene theory, with a clinical component. The fourth year includes classes in advanced dental hygiene theory, with additional core education requirements to complete necessary degree credits. Students can begin their studies in the Fall, Spring or Summer semesters.   Click here to view the BS Track A curriculum .                                                              Accelerated Track A (for Transfer Students)                               For incoming students with possible transfer credits, the BS degree may be completed in a shorter period of time. All BS track options will be discussed at the time of the applicant\u2019s information sharing session/ interview with an admissions counselor once official transcripts are reviewed.

Track B (Degree Completion)                               This curriculum is for a dental hygiene student who has completed an Associate\u2019s degree in dental hygiene from an accredited dental hygiene program and wishes to complete a BS degree. A student who completed an initial degree in dental hygiene at another institution may transfer up to 96 credits with a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better. At least 32 credits must be taken through NYU. Students who completed 78 credits for the Associate in Applied Science degree at NYU\u2019s Dental Hygiene program must complete 128 total credits for the Bachelor in Dental Hygiene. Students can begin their studies in Fall, Spring or Summer semesters. Most classes are offered online and can be completed full-time or part-time.   Click here to view the BS Track B (Degree Completion) curriculum .     DEGREE COMPLETION &quot;TRACK B&quot; STUDENTS/CORE COURSE POLICY   Students must complete all NYUCD Dental Hygiene Program core courses for degree eligibility. These may include courses not required for the candidate's AAS degree but necessary for the NYUCD Dental Hygiene Program.   For out of state residents who will not be taking the NY State Pain Management course through the Dental Hygiene Program at NYUCD, students must submit official completion of certification of local anesthesia/nitrous oxide training. This must be in the form of an official state continuing education certificate showing successful completion of the individual state mandated course. Continuing education credits do not count as transfer credits. Students must still have earned a total of 128 credits for degree conferral of the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene from NYUCD.                      Associate of Applied Science Degree   The Associate in Applied Science (AAS) Degree Program in Dental Hygiene is comprised of lecture courses in dental and health sciences along with clinical and hands-on experience. The 78 credit curriculum is offered as a &quot;fast-track&quot; 17-month program , a two-year day program or a three-year day program , or a three-year evening program . Dental hygiene students are prepared to perform competently in providing preventive and therapeutic patient oral health care. The dental hygiene program, located within the NYU College of Dentistry, allows students to work side by side with dental (DDS) students, dental faculty and dental hygiene faculty in the clinical portion of the curriculum. By working in these clinical settings with culturally diverse patients, dental hygiene students gain invaluable knowledge and experiences.                                                  New! \"Fast Track\" 17-Month Program                               Effective January 2015, NYUCD will offer an accelerated, continuous, 17-month, Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree in dental hygiene.   The Fast-Track AAS degree program, the first of its kind in New York State, is designed specifically to enable highly motivated students to gain access to the same innovative, high quality education as that offered by the traditional two-to-three year course of study, but in a more concentrated period. The course of study commences in January and runs continuously, including summer courses, through the following May.   The deadline for submission of applications for this program is November 1st.

Two-Year Daytime Track                               The two-year track is often the most sought-after track of the AAS degree program. It is also the most condensed of the tracks due to its heavy credit load with semesters averaging 18-20+ credits (full-time status at NYU is 12-20 credits). Students navigate through the 78 credit program over two academic years of study. Some students may have courses that are eligible for transfer, which could lessen the student\u2019s academic load; however, due to course sequencing, this track still requires a two-year commitment. Class meeting times vary from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm over five days per week. Semesters average 15 weeks.

Three-Year Daytime Track                               The three-year day track extends the full-time two year Associate curriculum, allowing students to complete the required 78 credit program through a less intense full-time credit load.

Three-Year Evening Track                               The 3 \u00bd year evening track extends the two year Associate curriculum with evening course offerings each semester, including summers. This track is popular among students who work full-time, have life/work responsibilities and still wish to seek a career in the dental hygiene profession. Students navigate through the 78 credit evening program and meet for courses four nights per week. Class times vary from 5:00 pm - 9:00 pm. There are three courses in the dental hygiene program that begin at 4:00 pm; these &quot;twilight&quot; courses blend the day and evening students into one class. One of these courses is offered in the spring semester of the student\u2019s second year of the program and two are offered in the student\u2019s third year (one in fall and spring) of the program. Some students may have courses eligible for transfer, which could lessen the student\u2019s academic load; however, due to course sequencing, this track requires three years for degree completion. Credit loads vary from full-time to part-time throughout this track. Students completing this degree program have their degree awarded in September, instead of May. Semesters average 15 weeks.

As part of the clinical requirements, students rotate through specialty areas such as orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, implant dentistry, pediatric dentistry, and hospital clinics, while improving their clinical expertise. Domestic and international outreach opportunities in underserved areas are available to students in their second year. Selected students continue to work closely with dental students and other faculty members, providing comprehensive dental treatment to those who may not have access to care.   Upon completion of the 78 credit curriculum, students are qualified to take the clinical board examinations and the dental hygiene national boards, which are requirements for state licensure. The NYU dental hygiene program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation.                                              admission requirements Read More                           application process Read More                           online application Read More                         frequently asked questions Read More                LEARN MORE:     Prerequisite Courses   Student Registration Help   Academic Calendar   Health and Technical Standards   Join Our Mailing List                                                                                Academic Programs                                                 DDS Program                                                   Dental Hygiene Programs                                                   Advanced Education Programs                                                   Master's Degree Programs                                                   Certificate Program in Clinical Research                                                   Programs for International Dentists                                                                                                        Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                     Research                                                 Research at NYUCD                                                   Bluestone Center for Clinical Research                                                   HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)                                                   Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)                                                   NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                     Patient Care                                                 Become a Patient at NYUCD                                                   Emergency Services / Urgent Care                                                   General Dentistry                                                   Pediatric Dentistry                                                   Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery                                                   Orthodontics                                                   Implant Dentistry                                                   Endodontics                                                   Periodontics                                                   Prosthodontics                                                   Special Needs Program                                                   Patient Advocate                                                   Linhart CDE Program                                                   NYU Dental Faculty Practices                                                   NYU Oral Cancer Center                                                   NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                     Quick Links                                                 About Us                                                   Admissions Information                                                   Academy of Distinguished Educators                                                   Interprofessional Education                                                   Current Students                                                   Intranet                                                   Departments/Faculty                                                   Global Reach                                                   News, Publications and Facts                                                   Working at NYUCD                                                   Contact Us                                                   Directions                                                    Connect                  NYU College of Dentistry  345 E. 24th Street  (corner of First Avenue)  New York, NY, 10010                            (212) 998-9800                            NYUCD Facebook Page       NYUCD Twitter Page       NYUCD YouTube Page       NYUCD LinkedIn Page                 MAKE A GIFT                                                    Copyright &copy; New York University College of Dentistry          Feedback"}]},

The Dental Hygiene programs at NYU College of Dentistry provide extraordinary clinical and academic opportunities for students interested in preventive oral healthcare and the promotion of good health. A key member of the healthcare team, the dental hygienist works together with the dentist to meet the oral health needs of patients and thereby improve patients' quality of life.   The Office of Allied Health Programs houses two degree programs, both of which prepare students for careers in dental hygiene: Bachelor of Science (BS) in Dental Hygiene and Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Dental Hygiene .   EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND MISSION   The mission of the New York University Dental Hygiene Programs is to partner with students to achieve academic excellence; promote scholarly activity, health promotion, disease prevention and research; to participate in community service; and to offer comprehensive client care, utilizing critical thinking and evidence-based decision making. As goals, the program will prepare a competent dental hygienist, maintain a contemporary dental hygiene program that reflects relevant and current dental hygiene practice, and provide an interdisciplinary integrated curriculum.   The NYU Advantage   Attending the only dental hygiene program housed within a dental college in the state of New York, Dental Hygiene students at the NYU College of Dentistry have the unique opportunity to work in integrated clinical settings alongside DDS students as well as faculty members from dental hygiene, dentistry and specialty areas -- gaining invaluable experiences as they learn the practice of dental hygiene while treating a highly diverse patient population. Academic excellence and clinical expertise are further supported by rotations through specialty areas (orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, implant dentistry, and pediatric dentistry), preparing students through a comprehensive and challenging education.

I want to move through the program as quickly as possible and I can go full-time.                               The two-year, three-year and three-and-a-half-year evening tracks all consist of the same (78 credit) core curriculum leading to the Associate of Applied Science degree. There are differences in the curriculum design of these tracks; for example, the two-year track is a compact, full-time credit platform requiring a two-year commitment to the program. Course loads per semester range from 18-21 credits, with courses scheduled four and a half days per week and some days ending at 6:00 pm. One evening course is included in track as well. The curriculum design for the three-year and three-and-a-half-year tracks are spread out accordingly.   Our Fast Track requires a 17-month commitment and follows the same core curriculum as the tracks above. This full-time credit platform begins in the spring semester which runs from January and continues through May of the following year. View the fast track curriculum .   The Bachelor of Science degree (128 credit) core curriculum can be completed in three to four years depending upon accepted transfer credits. You may apply to the BS degree program in all semesters with some online course availability.                                                              I missed the fall deadline and still wish to start in the spring.                               You can apply for the AAS fast track or the AAS or BS pre-requisite program that begins in the spring semester. There may be options in the three-year day program but may require advisement and modifications in registration.                                                              I have many possible transfer credits for previous colleges.                               The courses for the Associate of Applied Science and Bachelor of Science are in specific sequence. Depending upon the number of total accepted transfer credits, you may have a lighter course/credit load; however, the length of the program towards the degree still remains the same. This concept allows time to sequence the clinical experiences over four semesters.                                                              I need to go part-time.                               The three-year day curriculum extends the two-year curriculum course load by an additional academic year. Those accepted into the three-and-a-half-year evening track meet for class four nights per week with courses generally taking place between 5:00 pm and 9:50 pm (three classes in the evening program begin at 4:00 pm), and the evening curriculum requires enrollment in summer sessions. Students in this program are considered candidates for degree conferral in September instead of May. While choosing this evening track requires a longer financial commitment, many select this curriculum for work and personal lifestyle reasons.   New York University defines part-time status as fewer than 12 credits. Full-time status is defined as 12-20 credits. Although the part-time program curriculum is defined by length of time and not credit status, it is possible with advisor guidance to plan a curriculum allowing students to take courses at part-time credit status throughout their enrollment in the program. However this might require additional semesters or summer enrollment. Courses have specific time offerings, sequences and pre-requisites. The three-year day and evening programs are designed to provide students the ability to continue earning an income or manage family matters while in school.                                                              I have a dental degree from another country.                               The application process requires you to submit an official course-by-course evaluation reviewed by Educational Credential Evaluators . Courses are then considered for transfer based upon policy of time, grades, conversion of transfer credit and similar content. You can still decide which program track is best for your needs: Associate two-year, fast track, three-year day/evening or Bachelor program. The College does not yet have an advanced placement process. Depending upon the number of total accepted transfer credits, you may have a lighter course/credit load; however, the length of the program towards the degree still remains the same.                                                              I do not have the pre-requisite courses.                               Apply as a pre-requisite student and plan to register for Introduction to Biology and/or Introduction to Chemistry as needed. Upon completion of these courses with a grade of B or better, conditional acceptance can be modified allowing you selection of your choice of program and track. Our pre-requisite courses are 2 credits each. You can consider registering for additional liberal arts or writing courses to qualify for full- or part-time financial aid.                                                              I need financial aid.                               For those students who qualify, financial aid is available. Aid eligibility is determined from the data provided on your FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), TAP (Tuition Assistance Program - for NY state residents only) and the amount of aid you have used while in attendance at other higher education institutions.   NYU defines full-time as 12-20 credits and part-time or half-time as over 6 credits. To be eligible for aid, students must be registered for at least 6 credits.    Financial Aid representatives are available at the College of Dentistry to assist you with any questions or concerns.                                                              Should I apply for the AAS or four-year BS degree?                               Choosing to earn a degree in Dental Hygiene requires a major decision, significant financial commitment and a great amount of time and dedication to the program. The practice of dental hygiene comprises many work settings with varying responsibilities. The Bachelor of Science degree provides a more comprehensive education and expands opportunities for employment beyond the scope of the private practice setting to areas such as teaching, research, public health and the corporate sector.   The profession of dental hygiene is moving to Bachelor of Science entry level practice.                                                              I hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree from another institution. Why should I enroll in the AAS degree program?                               In order to become a dental hygienist, you must complete at least an Associate of Science or Associate of Applied Science degree in dental hygiene. Some of your liberal arts courses may transfer into our AAS program to lighten your academic load. You may still select from the various tracks to meet your needs.                    BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE   The Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene Program is comprised of 128 credits, which can be completed either along a &quot;typical&quot; four-year college track (Track A) or through a degree completion track (Track B). Track A is a four-year dental hygiene program which allows the student to obtain the BS degree while also receiving dental hygiene education. Track B ( degree completion ) is for students who have already completed an accredited program in dental hygiene and now wish to pursue a BS degree. Additionally, an Accelerated Track A for students with possible transfer credits is available.   All BS tracks include unique internship opportunities in specialized areas of focus, such as education, research, public health and healthcare management. Two required internships (100 hours total) must be completed and are carefully selected by the student with faculty advisement. The classes offered within these tracks are unique in that they familiarize the students with varied aspects of healthcare beyond the clinical scope of practice. In the field of dental hygiene, a BS degree will create more innovative employment opportunities within the field of dentistry and dental hygiene.                                                    Track A                               This curriculum is offered full-time and it is completed within four years. The first year curriculum includes courses in general education, basic sciences and clinical sciences. The second and third years include dental hygiene theory, with a clinical component. The fourth year includes classes in advanced dental hygiene theory, with additional core education requirements to complete necessary degree credits. Students can begin their studies in the Fall, Spring or Summer semesters.   Click here to view the BS Track A curriculum .                                                              Accelerated Track A (for Transfer Students)                               For incoming students with possible transfer credits, the BS degree may be completed in a shorter period of time. All BS track options will be discussed at the time of the applicant\u2019s information sharing session/ interview with an admissions counselor once official transcripts are reviewed.

Track B (Degree Completion)                               This curriculum is for a dental hygiene student who has completed an Associate\u2019s degree in dental hygiene from an accredited dental hygiene program and wishes to complete a BS degree. A student who completed an initial degree in dental hygiene at another institution may transfer up to 96 credits with a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better. At least 32 credits must be taken through NYU. Students who completed 78 credits for the Associate in Applied Science degree at NYU\u2019s Dental Hygiene program must complete 128 total credits for the Bachelor in Dental Hygiene. Students can begin their studies in Fall, Spring or Summer semesters. Most classes are offered online and can be completed full-time or part-time.   Click here to view the BS Track B (Degree Completion) curriculum .     DEGREE COMPLETION &quot;TRACK B&quot; STUDENTS/CORE COURSE POLICY   Students must complete all NYUCD Dental Hygiene Program core courses for degree eligibility. These may include courses not required for the candidate's AAS degree but necessary for the NYUCD Dental Hygiene Program.   For out of state residents who will not be taking the NY State Pain Management course through the Dental Hygiene Program at NYUCD, students must submit official completion of certification of local anesthesia/nitrous oxide training. This must be in the form of an official state continuing education certificate showing successful completion of the individual state mandated course. Continuing education credits do not count as transfer credits. Students must still have earned a total of 128 credits for degree conferral of the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene from NYUCD.                      Associate of Applied Science Degree   The Associate in Applied Science (AAS) Degree Program in Dental Hygiene is comprised of lecture courses in dental and health sciences along with clinical and hands-on experience. The 78 credit curriculum is offered as a &quot;fast-track&quot; 17-month program , a two-year day program or a three-year day program , or a three-year evening program . Dental hygiene students are prepared to perform competently in providing preventive and therapeutic patient oral health care. The dental hygiene program, located within the NYU College of Dentistry, allows students to work side by side with dental (DDS) students, dental faculty and dental hygiene faculty in the clinical portion of the curriculum. By working in these clinical settings with culturally diverse patients, dental hygiene students gain invaluable knowledge and experiences.                                                  New! \"Fast Track\" 17-Month Program                               Effective January 2015, NYUCD will offer an accelerated, continuous, 17-month, Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree in dental hygiene.   The Fast-Track AAS degree program, the first of its kind in New York State, is designed specifically to enable highly motivated students to gain access to the same innovative, high quality education as that offered by the traditional two-to-three year course of study, but in a more concentrated period. The course of study commences in January and runs continuously, including summer courses, through the following May.   The deadline for submission of applications for this program is November 1st.

Two-Year Daytime Track                               The two-year track is often the most sought-after track of the AAS degree program. It is also the most condensed of the tracks due to its heavy credit load with semesters averaging 18-20+ credits (full-time status at NYU is 12-20 credits). Students navigate through the 78 credit program over two academic years of study. Some students may have courses that are eligible for transfer, which could lessen the student\u2019s academic load; however, due to course sequencing, this track still requires a two-year commitment. Class meeting times vary from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm over five days per week. Semesters average 15 weeks.

Three-Year Daytime Track                               The three-year day track extends the full-time two year Associate curriculum, allowing students to complete the required 78 credit program through a less intense full-time credit load.

Three-Year Evening Track                               The 3 \u00bd year evening track extends the two year Associate curriculum with evening course offerings each semester, including summers. This track is popular among students who work full-time, have life/work responsibilities and still wish to seek a career in the dental hygiene profession.

There are three courses in the dental hygiene program that begin at 4:00 pm; these &quot;twilight&quot; courses blend the day and evening students into one class. One of these courses is offered in the spring semester of the student\u2019s second year of the program and two are offered in the student\u2019s third year (one in fall and spring) of the program.

As part of the clinical requirements, students rotate through specialty areas such as orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, implant dentistry, pediatric dentistry, and hospital clinics, while improving their clinical expertise. Domestic and international outreach opportunities in underserved areas are available to students in their second year. Selected students continue to work closely with dental students and other faculty members, providing comprehensive dental treatment to those who may not have access to care.   Upon completion of the 78 credit curriculum, students are qualified to take the clinical board examinations and the dental hygiene national boards, which are requirements for state licensure. The NYU dental hygiene program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation.                                              admission requirements Read More                           application process Read More                           online application Read More                         frequently asked questions Read More                LEARN MORE:     Prerequisite Courses   Student Registration Help   Academic Calendar   Health and Technical Standards   Join Our Mailing List                                                                                Academic Programs                                                 DDS Program                                                   Dental Hygiene Programs                                                   Advanced Education Programs                                                   Master's Degree Programs                                                   Certificate Program in Clinical Research                                                   Programs for International Dentists                                                                                                        Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                     Research                                                 Research at NYUCD                                                   Bluestone Center for Clinical Research                                                   HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)                                                   Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)                                                   NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                     Patient Care                                                 Become a Patient at NYUCD                                                   Emergency Services / Urgent Care                                                   General Dentistry                                                   Pediatric Dentistry                                                   Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery                                                   Orthodontics                                                   Implant Dentistry                                                   Endodontics                                                   Periodontics                                                   Prosthodontics                                                   Special Needs Program                                                   Patient Advocate                                                   Linhart CDE Program                                                   NYU Dental Faculty Practices                                                   NYU Oral Cancer Center                                                   NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                     Quick Links                                                 About Us                                                   Admissions Information                                                   Academy of Distinguished Educators                                                   Interprofessional Education                                                   Current Students                                                   Intranet                                                   Departments/Faculty                                                   Global Reach                                                   News, Publications and Facts                                                   Working at NYUCD                                                   Contact Us                                                   Directions                                                    Connect                  NYU College of Dentistry  345 E. 24th Street  (corner of First Avenue)  New York, NY, 10010                            (212) 998-9800                            NYUCD Facebook Page       NYUCD Twitter Page       NYUCD YouTube Page       NYUCD LinkedIn Page                 MAKE A GIFT                                                    Copyright &copy; New York University College of Dentistry          Feedback"}]}]
