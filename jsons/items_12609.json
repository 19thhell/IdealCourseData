To prepare students who can use evidence-based research to facilitate the initiation, development, and management of programs related to the prevention and intervention efforts for psychological, social, educational, and health problems.       The MA in Human Development and Social Intervention offers a distinct curriculum that explicitly emphasizes the practical skills of research design and methods , grant writing and grant management , and program development and evaluation from a community psychology perspective. The curriculum is firmly rooted in the traditions and lexicon of community, social, personality, and developmental psychology. You will learn how issues such as poverty, race, gender, and culture influence the daily lives of individuals. Hands-on research and grant writing skills will aid your efforts to apply social interventions to these issues.    The program is designed for college graduates with backgrounds in the social sciences, including psychology, social work, sociology, anthropology, and race, gender or ethnic studies, as well as those who have work or volunteer experiences in non-profit organizations, schools, health facilities, and community centers and seek to further or change the direction of their careers.    All students in this program will receive training in:       Theories of human development;    Theories and techniques of preventive and promotive interventions;    Theories and concepts of the influence of culture and context in various settings;    Conceptualization and analysis of individual and social change;    Research methodology including program management and evaluation and grant preparation and grant management.       In addition to a core of research methodology and psychology courses, students will also pursue one of the following three areas of study:       Developmental Psychology : Students will examine classical as well as contemporary literature on developmental changes in emotional, social, and cognitive areas, with specific attention to the roles of culture and context (e.g., family, school, community) in these processes.    Health : Students will examine the individual level, socioecological, and sociopolitical factors that shape physical and mental health outcomes for individuals, families, and communities.    Methodology : Students will gain expertise in research design and in the use of various methods of quantitative and qualitative reasoning and analysis of data.       By the end of the MA program, students will be able to:       Identify and analyze the social, cognitive, emotional, and health development across the lifespan as well as the psychological, cultural, and socioecological factors that influence the contexts and systems in which people develop (e.g., families, schools, and neighborhoods).    Apply evidence-based research to facilitate the initiation, development, and management of programs related to the prevention and intervention efforts for psychological, social, educational, and health problems.

She also holds an MPH in Population and Family Health from Columbia University&rsquo;s Mailman School of Public Health. Before starting her doctoral degree, Stacey coordinated and directed a variety of federally- and foundation-funded intervention and service research projects through her work at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the HIV Center at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University. These projects used community collaborative approaches to develop and evaluate interventions targeting promotion of adolescents&rsquo; health, education, and development across multiple domestic and international urban contexts (e.g., families, clinics, schools, and communities). More recently, as part of her doctoral studies, Stacey has expanded her research to include strength-based approaches to adolescent development and emergent adulthood in high school and community college settings. This work has three primary foci: (1) the study of social networks in community college settings as conduits for youth social capital accrual and positive educational, employment, and psychosocial outcomes, (2) the development of rigorous and reliable classroom-level measurement tools for community college settings, and (3) the application of this work to intervention and policy targeting social capital accrual and life skills development in secondary and higher education settings. She has published in Developmental Psychology, Journal of Early Adolescence, Journal of Adolescent Health, Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, Clinical Social Work Journal, AIDS Care, and Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies: An International Interdisciplinary Journal for Research, Policy and Care. As she moves forward with her career, she is particularly interested in further unifying her public health and education-based research interests to design and implement interventions that shape youths&rsquo; holistic development in context.

After graduation, she spent three years working for a humanitarian aid organization, first in Tallinn, Estonia, and later in New York. She then went to Athens, Greece on a Fulbright grant, where she worked at a high school and explored programming options surrounding gender based discrimination and LGBT bullying. Broadly speaking, she is interested in how interventions drawn from social psychology and behavioral science can be applied to public policy in order to reduce inequalities in the US, especially through choice architecture and careful design of channel factors. She is particularly interested in issues of incarceration and sustainability. View Esther's CV .           Maia Connors    Maia Connors is a doctoral student in the Psychology &amp; Social Intervention program at NYU Steinhardt.

Maia's advisor and research mentor is Pamela Morris. View Maia's CV.           Nia Gordon    Nia Gordon is a doctoral student in the Psychology and Social Intervention program at NYU Steinhardt. Nia currently works on The Well-being of South Africa's Children, or SIZE Project with her advisor and research mentor Erin Godfrey and also with Larry Aber and LaRue Allen. The SIZE project works to understand how South African children are being affected by the co-occurring adversities caused by household poverty and HIV/AIDS, and to assess the reach and influence of current government-funded grants and services (health, education and social grants). She also works with Erin Godfrey on the American Customs project which explores how low-income immigrant mothers of young children perceive the American social system and examines links between mothers&rsquo; perceptions of the social system, the cultural qualities they cultivate in their children and their children&rsquo;s cognitive and social development. Her research interests include international and domestic social policy, patterns of social service access and utilization and immigrant parents&rsquo; socialization goals for their children. View Nia's CV .              Justina Grayman   Justina Grayman Justina Grayman is a fifth-year doctoral candidate in the Psychology and Social Intervention program. She received her B.A. in psychology from Stanford University. Justina's research involves community empowerment, community organizing, and collective action. Specifically, she examines methods of increasing people&rsquo;s concern about social justice issues and propensity to engage in (and remain engaged in) collective action. Justina is particularly committed to examining these topics in action-oriented collaborations with community organizations. Since 2011, she has been designing and implementing her dissertation research project, which has been funded by the NYU Steinhardt Department of Applied Psychology, the Society for Community Research &amp; Action, and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. In this mixed-method dissertation research project, she has worked with over 20 parent organizers in eight education activism organizations to examine organizers&rsquo; communication strategies that most effectively motivate parents to participate in these organizations. Since 2012, she has also recruited, trained, and supervised an amazing team of undergraduate and graduate student research assistants, who assist her in conducting this research. Justina has also taught three courses at New York University and has enjoyed teaching students to consider different perspectives on social justice and to value collaboration and relationship building in life and society. Justina's faculty mentor is Dr. Erin Godfrey.          Jessica Harding    Jessica Harding is a 4th year doctoral student in the Psychology and Social Intervention Program. She received her BA from the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Her research interests lie at the intersection of research and social policy, with a particular focus on the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. Specifically, she works with Professors Pamela Morris (her dissertation chair) and Diane Hughes, to explore two distinct, but related, influences on low-income children&rsquo;s academic outcomes &ndash; parenting practices and maternal education. Her research in both these areas takes two main forms &ndash; a) secondary data analysis to understand these influences and b) intervention research that aims to improve children&rsquo;s academic outcomes by changing the family context. View Jessica's CV .          Sophia Hwang   Sophia Hwang is a first-year doctoral student in the Psychology and Social Intervention Program at the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Her research interests include school-based mental health and social-emotional learning for adolescents, the role of adults in educational contexts to support positive identity development and resiliency in students, and trauma-informed practice in schools. Ultimately, Sophia aims to conduct interdisciplinary research that can impact policy and practice so that urban school systems may better educate the whole child.    Before starting her doctoral studies, Sophia was a Program Manager at PolicyLab housed at The Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia. In this position, Sophia oversaw the education portfolio and conducted stakeholder-driven research used to inform policy decisions improving academic outcomes for youth involved with the child welfare and juvenile justice system in the School District of Philadelphia.    Previous professional experiences include working at the Health Federation of Philadelphia as a Stoneleigh Foundation Emerging Leader Fellow to assess trauma-informed curricula for social workers and teachers. Additionally, Sophia taught science at a comprehensive, public high school in South Philadelphia.

Natalia Rojas   Natalia Rojas is a doctoral student in the Psychology and Social Intervention program at New York University. Previously, she received her BA from New York University. After graduating, she worked at MDRC, a non-profit social policy research organization, as a research associate, working to implement and evaluate two large-scale randomized control trials of early childhood interventions focused on social-emotional and math skills in low-income preschoolers. Broadly, her research interests include the intersection between research and social policy, specifically early childhood education, teacher professional development, and designing and testing interventions at improving these settings and informing policy. She currently works with Hiro Yoshikawa. View Natalia&rsquo;s full CV .              Kate Schwartz    Kate Schwartz , MPP, is a third year doctoral student in the Psychology &amp; Social Intervention program at NYU Steinhardt. Her research interests center on setting-level interventions aimed at improving broad-based support systems, and thus developmental outcomes, for youth growing up in under resourced, low-income environments. Currently, she has three main projects. First, she is working, in collaboration with Drs. Cappella and Seidman, on a series of papers that, generally, seek to better understand the relations between school structure, school climate, and student outcomes during the middle grades and, specifically, seek to identify protective factors for low-income, urban youth across the (risky) transition from elementary to middle school. Second, she is working with Dr. Cappella to assist a high school in the South Bronx in evaluating and improving its student engagement initiatives for youth at high risk of academic failure. Third, she is the Project Director for 'Additional Insights,' a collaboration led by Dr. Aber among NYU, the World Bank, and Innovations for Poverty Action. This project capitalizes on hundreds of impact evaluations in women's and children's development and children's education that were conducted in low- and middle- income countries over the past decade, as well as new methodology for assessing heterogeneity of program impact. The goal is to better understand &ldquo;for whom&rdquo; programs work (or don&rsquo;t work), &ldquo;why&rdquo; they work, and &ldquo;under what conditions&rdquo; they work. Kate has also been working in collaboration with Publicolor, a nonprofit organization in NYC, to evaluate the impact on student learning and engagement as a result of transforming the school environment through bright, student-designed paint makeovers. Kate received her A.B. in English from Brandeis University in 2004 , where she studied creative writing, women&rsquo;s studies, and domestic violence and created and led a writing workshop for survivors of childhood trauma at a local assisted living apartment. After her undergraduate, she spent six years working in direct social services and program administration in San Francisco; Santiago, Chile; and New York City around issues of homelessness and sexual/physical abuse. In 2012, she received her Master of Public Policy from the University of Chicago, Harris School. While at Harris, she worked as a Research Assistant both to Dr. Amy Claessens, analyzing the relationship between early math skills and 8th grade academic performance using the ECLS-K, and at NORC, where she worked with the NLSY97 on a number of analysis and data coding projects. Kate&rsquo;s advisor and research mentor is Elise Cappella. View Kate&rsquo;s CV.          Carly Tubbs   Carly Tubbs is a doctoral student in the Psychology and Social Intervention program at the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. She holds a B.A. in comparative literature and an M.A. in psychology from NYU, from which she graduated summa cum laude. She is broadly interested in looking at the pathways through which rapid, macro-level changes in economic, political, and technological systems impact children's development. Working with her faculty mentors Pamela Morris, Diane Hughes, Erin Godfrey, and Larry Aber, she focuses on two main areas of inquiry: 1) examining how an aggregate economic crisis such as the current economic recession interacts with household-level resources and processes to impact parents' and children's well-being; and 2) understanding how families in the United States are affected by rising income volatility and instability. Carly also currently collaborates with the World Bank, Human Rights Watch, and the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research in order to impact policy discussions about these issues at state, federal, and international levels.              Tess Yanisch   Tess M. Yanisch is a second-year doctoral student in the Psychology and Social Intervention Program at the NYU Steinhardt. Her research interests include beliefs about power and authority in society, agency/efficacy in marginalized groups, attitudes toward people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and the origins and correlates of prejudice against low-status groups.    While an undergraduate at Oberlin College, she spent a year doing behavior coding for a study of attachment style and conflict resolution in romantic relationships and two more investigating environmental values, motivation, and resource-use reduction in a nationwide college conservation competition. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in psychology in January 2013.    Since September of 2013, Tess has worked on several of Dr. Allen's civic engagement projects, investigating the motivations, intentions, and styles of civic engagement among youth in New York and Paris. She has also been involved in designing a similar study to be implemented in Poland; a study of American youths' ethnic identity, self-esteem, and civic engagement; and a study on the relative importance of different political issues to emerging adults (18-25) in the United States. Her second-year research project focuses on patterns of attitudes toward women's, immigrants', and ethnic minorities' rights in adolescents. View Tess's CV .

To prepare students who can use evidence-based research to facilitate the initiation, development, and management of programs related to the prevention and intervention efforts for psychological, social, educational, and health problems.       The MA in Human Development and Social Intervention offers a distinct curriculum that explicitly emphasizes the practical skills of research design and methods , grant writing and grant management , and program development and evaluation from a community psychology perspective. The curriculum is firmly rooted in the traditions and lexicon of community, social, personality, and developmental psychology. You will learn how issues such as poverty, race, gender, and culture influence the daily lives of individuals. Hands-on research and grant writing skills will aid your efforts to apply social interventions to these issues.    The program is designed for college graduates with backgrounds in the social sciences, including psychology, social work, sociology, anthropology, and race, gender or ethnic studies, as well as those who have work or volunteer experiences in non-profit organizations, schools, health facilities, and community centers and seek to further or change the direction of their careers.    All students in this program will receive training in:       Theories of human development;    Theories and techniques of preventive and promotive interventions;    Theories and concepts of the influence of culture and context in various settings;    Conceptualization and analysis of individual and social change;    Research methodology including program management and evaluation and grant preparation and grant management.       In addition to a core of research methodology and psychology courses, students will also pursue one of the following three areas of study:       Developmental Psychology : Students will examine classical as well as contemporary literature on developmental changes in emotional, social, and cognitive areas, with specific attention to the roles of culture and context (e.g., family, school, community) in these processes.    Health : Students will examine the individual level, socioecological, and sociopolitical factors that shape physical and mental health outcomes for individuals, families, and communities.    Methodology : Students will gain expertise in research design and in the use of various methods of quantitative and qualitative reasoning and analysis of data.       By the end of the MA program, students will be able to:       Identify and analyze the social, cognitive, emotional, and health development across the lifespan as well as the psychological, cultural, and socioecological factors that influence the contexts and systems in which people develop (e.g., families, schools, and neighborhoods).    Apply evidence-based research to facilitate the initiation, development, and management of programs related to the prevention and intervention efforts for psychological, social, educational, and health problems.    Demonstrate the practical skills of research design and methods, grant writing and grant management, and program development and evaluation from a community psychology perspective.    Integrate the traditions and lexicon of community, social, personality, and developmental psychology into their work.    Describe and analyze how issues such as poverty, race, gender, and culture influence the daily lives of individuals.

She also holds an MPH in Population and Family Health from Columbia University&rsquo;s Mailman School of Public Health. Before starting her doctoral degree, Stacey coordinated and directed a variety of federally- and foundation-funded intervention and service research projects through her work at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the HIV Center at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University. These projects used community collaborative approaches to develop and evaluate interventions targeting promotion of adolescents&rsquo; health, education, and development across multiple domestic and international urban contexts (e.g., families, clinics, schools, and communities). More recently, as part of her doctoral studies, Stacey has expanded her research to include strength-based approaches to adolescent development and emergent adulthood in high school and community college settings. This work has three primary foci: (1) the study of social networks in community college settings as conduits for youth social capital accrual and positive educational, employment, and psychosocial outcomes, (2) the development of rigorous and reliable classroom-level measurement tools for community college settings, and (3) the application of this work to intervention and policy targeting social capital accrual and life skills development in secondary and higher education settings. She has published in Developmental Psychology, Journal of Early Adolescence, Journal of Adolescent Health, Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, Clinical Social Work Journal, AIDS Care, and Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies: An International Interdisciplinary Journal for Research, Policy and Care. As she moves forward with her career, she is particularly interested in further unifying her public health and education-based research interests to design and implement interventions that shape youths&rsquo; holistic development in context.

Her research interests center on setting-level interventions aimed at improving broad-based support systems, and thus developmental outcomes, for youth growing up in under resourced, low-income environments. Currently, she has three main projects. First, she is working, in collaboration with Drs. Cappella and Seidman, on a series of papers that, generally, seek to better understand the relations between school structure, school climate, and student outcomes during the middle grades and, specifically, seek to identify protective factors for low-income, urban youth across the (risky) transition from elementary to middle school. Second, she is working with Dr. Cappella to assist a high school in the South Bronx in evaluating and improving its student engagement initiatives for youth at high risk of academic failure. Third, she is the Project Director for 'Additional Insights,' a collaboration led by Dr. Aber among NYU, the World Bank, and Innovations for Poverty Action. This project capitalizes on hundreds of impact evaluations in women's and children's development and children's education that were conducted in low- and middle- income countries over the past decade, as well as new methodology for assessing heterogeneity of program impact. The goal is to better understand &ldquo;for whom&rdquo; programs work (or don&rsquo;t work), &ldquo;why&rdquo; they work, and &ldquo;under what conditions&rdquo; they work. Kate has also been working in collaboration with Publicolor, a nonprofit organization in NYC, to evaluate the impact on student learning and engagement as a result of transforming the school environment through bright, student-designed paint makeovers. Kate received her A.B. in English from Brandeis University in 2004 , where she studied creative writing, women&rsquo;s studies, and domestic violence and created and led a writing workshop for survivors of childhood trauma at a local assisted living apartment.

Carly Tubbs   Carly Tubbs is a doctoral student in the Psychology and Social Intervention program at the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. She holds a B.A. in comparative literature and an M.A. in psychology from NYU, from which she graduated summa cum laude. She is broadly interested in looking at the pathways through which rapid, macro-level changes in economic, political, and technological systems impact children's development. Working with her faculty mentors Pamela Morris, Diane Hughes, Erin Godfrey, and Larry Aber, she focuses on two main areas of inquiry: 1) examining how an aggregate economic crisis such as the current economic recession interacts with household-level resources and processes to impact parents' and children's well-being; and 2) understanding how families in the United States are affected by rising income volatility and instability. Carly also currently collaborates with the World Bank, Human Rights Watch, and the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research in order to impact policy discussions about these issues at state, federal, and international levels.              Tess Yanisch   Tess M. Yanisch is a second-year doctoral student in the Psychology and Social Intervention Program at the NYU Steinhardt. Her research interests include beliefs about power and authority in society, agency/efficacy in marginalized groups, attitudes toward people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and the origins and correlates of prejudice against low-status groups.    While an undergraduate at Oberlin College, she spent a year doing behavior coding for a study of attachment style and conflict resolution in romantic relationships and two more investigating environmental values, motivation, and resource-use reduction in a nationwide college conservation competition. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in psychology in January 2013.    Since September of 2013, Tess has worked on several of Dr. Allen's civic engagement projects, investigating the motivations, intentions, and styles of civic engagement among youth in New York and Paris. She has also been involved in designing a similar study to be implemented in Poland; a study of American youths' ethnic identity, self-esteem, and civic engagement; and a study on the relative importance of different political issues to emerging adults (18-25) in the United States. Her second-year research project focuses on patterns of attitudes toward women's, immigrants', and ethnic minorities' rights in adolescents. View Tess's CV .

NYUPSI on Twitter                  PSI MISSION STATEMENT The mission of the Doctoral Training Program in Psychology and Social Intervention at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development (Department of Applied Psychology) at New York University is to train action scientists prepared to work in a variety of settings in order to understand, transform, and improve the contexts and systems in which humans develop across the life span. The program places a strong emphasis on: (a) understanding and assessing social settings, systems, and policies; (b) creating/improving, implementing and evaluating prevention and intervention programs; and (c) understanding various forms of diversity and structural inequality among individuals, institutions, communities, and societies. Ours is a research intensive program with a strong quantitative training component. Program faculty study a wide range of ecologies (e.g., families, schools, neighborhoods, policy contexts, programs) and preventive and policy interventions (e.g., psychological, social, educational and health programs), locally, nationally and internationally. Our faculty also conducts research on how cultural factors and identities influence and interact with experiences of these ecologies and interventions. Our New York City location provides an ideal urban setting for studying many kinds of communities, combined with gateways to the world at large. About Our Program Students work collaboratively with faculty mentors on a range of activities in these research areas, including study design, data collection and analysis, manuscript preparations, conference presentations, policy briefs, and evaluation activities. Program faculty collaborate closely with one another, as well as with other social, behavioral, health and policy scientists at NYU, other universities, and service, community and policy organizations. Program faculty also direct or co-direct affiliated institutes and centers at NYU, including the Institute for Human Development and Social Change, the Center for Health, Identity, Behavior, &amp; Prevention Studies, the Child and Family Policy Center, and the Center for Research on Culture, Development, and Education. PSI Program Goals &amp; Objectives       Build content knowledge base to understand and improve human development in social context.    Develop methodological skills that enable analysis of change over time and within and across levels of human ecology.    Acquire abilities to apply psychological and social science principles to the understanding of social settings, social/cultural contexts, and social and policy interventions.    Develop abilities to conceptualize, interpret, evaluate and disseminate evidence-based social and policy interventions; and develop the ethical, interpersonal, organizational, and technical capacities to undertake high-quality professional work in psychology and social intervention.
