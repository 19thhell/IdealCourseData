Americas Scholars participate in academic seminars and cultural activities with Gallatin faculty members.        Group Meetings and Activities   Throughout the academic year, Americas Scholars explore a particular theme through bi-weekly evening meetings. The majority of Americas Scholars activities will take place during this time, although some activities such as dinners and performances may occur at other times.   Examples of Americas Scholars activities:     Attending lectures and readings on topics related to the Americas   Visits to museums, dance performances, musical performances, and other cultural events   Independent research and collaborative group projects          International and Domestic Travel   The Americas Scholars investigate their yearly theme by traveling as a group during January to an international or domestic location. Group members prepare a project based on their explorations and share it with the Gallatin community.   Examples of past travel locations and themes:     Puerto Rico: &quot;Puerto Rico and New York: Culture and Community&quot;   Cuba: &quot;The Effects of Economic Embargo&quot;   Hawaii: &quot;Colonialism and Indigeneity&quot;   New Orleans: &quot;The Social Production of Natural Disaster&quot;   Brazil: &quot;Consumerism&quot;     Americas Scholars 2014-15   Details coming soon.

We wish to create a space of dialogue and discussion around matters concerning modern and contemporary Latin American art. Most of our events will take place in the seminar room of the IFA (although at times we will sponsor events elsewhere in the University). The idea is to have a smaller-than-usual venue for more intense conversation and to distribute either the papers or a pr\u00e9cis of the talk to the audience beforehand so that guests will have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the subject and formulate questions and comments.

Americas Scholars participate in academic seminars and cultural activities with Gallatin faculty members.        Group Meetings and Activities   Throughout the academic year, Americas Scholars explore a particular theme through bi-weekly evening meetings. The majority of Americas Scholars activities will take place during this time, although some activities such as dinners and performances may occur at other times.   Examples of Americas Scholars activities:     Attending lectures and readings on topics related to the Americas   Visits to museums, dance performances, musical performances, and other cultural events   Independent research and collaborative group projects          International and Domestic Travel   The Americas Scholars investigate their yearly theme by traveling as a group during January to an international or domestic location. Group members prepare a project based on their explorations and share it with the Gallatin community.   Examples of past travel locations and themes:     Puerto Rico: &quot;Puerto Rico and New York: Culture and Community&quot;   Cuba: &quot;The Effects of Economic Embargo&quot;   Hawaii: &quot;Colonialism and Indigeneity&quot;   New Orleans: &quot;The Social Production of Natural Disaster&quot;   Brazil: &quot;Consumerism&quot;     Americas Scholars 2014-15   Details coming soon.

We wish to create a space of dialogue and discussion around matters concerning modern and contemporary Latin American art. Most of our events will take place in the seminar room of the IFA (although at times we will sponsor events elsewhere in the University). The idea is to have a smaller-than-usual venue for more intense conversation and to distribute either the papers or a pr\u00e9cis of the talk to the audience beforehand so that guests will have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the subject and formulate questions and comments.    This forum is generously funded by the Institute of Studies on Latin American Art (ISLAA). For more information on ISLAA, click here .
