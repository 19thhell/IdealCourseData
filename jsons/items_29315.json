interdisciplinary, three-year program with the NYU Global Institute of Public Health is for students who seek to combine social work and public health with a global focus. At completion of the program, students will have earned a Master of Social Work degree (MSW) and a Master of Public Health degree (MPH). Courses are taught by professors drawn from relevant programs across five schools at NYU, including the Silver School of Social Work; the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service; the School of Medicine; the College of Dentistry (including the College of Nursing); and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The dual degrees are designed to provide the necessary skill sets for graduating students to pursue professional careers in both social work and public health, and prepare them for leadership roles in community healthcare settings, government agencies, and non-profit organizations in the United States and internationally.   Students in the MSW/MPH program would enroll as full-time students taking courses within each program concurrently. The MSW/MPH option is available to those choosing the Global Health Leadership MPH concentration.   Please note that neither degree is conferred until the requirements for both degrees are fulfilled.

MSW/MPH                                                                                                                                                                                 This interdisciplinary, three-year program with the NYU Global Institute of Public Health is for students who seek to combine social work and public health with a global focus. At completion of the program, students will have earned a Master of Social Work degree (MSW) and a Master of Public Health degree (MPH). Courses are taught by professors drawn from relevant programs across five schools at NYU, including the Silver School of Social Work; the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service; the School of Medicine; the College of Dentistry (including the College of Nursing); and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The dual degrees are designed to provide the necessary skill sets for graduating students to pursue professional careers in both social work and public health, and prepare them for leadership roles in community healthcare settings, government agencies, and non-profit organizations in the United States and internationally.   Students in the MSW/MPH program would enroll as full-time students taking courses within each program concurrently. The MSW/MPH option is available to those choosing the Global Health Leadership MPH concentration.   Please note that neither degree is conferred until the requirements for both degrees are fulfilled.
