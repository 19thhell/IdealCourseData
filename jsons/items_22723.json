Now, Resources benefits from a quicker, more intuitive file upload process. Within the \u201cAdd\" screen, users now have the option of drag-and-dropping multiple files from their computer directly into the Classes interface. If using Chrome, users may even upload the contents of entire folders via drag-and-drop.         Click to learn more .
