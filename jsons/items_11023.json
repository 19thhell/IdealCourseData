A report by the National Economic and Social Rights Initiative (NESRI) found that the NYC schools with the most punitive disciplinary policies are overwhelmingly under-resourced, overcrowded, and primarily attended by low-income students of color. Youth who are suspended from school are more likely to fall behind in school, be retained a grade, and drop out.   Whenever a student faces a superintendent\u2019s suspension, a hearing is scheduled to determine whether the student engaged in the incident as charged and, if so, the appropriate disciplinary measures. Parents have the right to bring a representative to the hearing. However, currently, in NYC, there are very few professionals who represent students in suspension hearings. The vast majority of families are unrepresented at their students\u2019 suspension hearings.     Suspension Representation Project (SRP)   The Suspension Representation Project (SRP) is an advocacy group that trains law students to represent public school students in superintendent\u2019s suspension hearings and help safeguard their right to education. Students at NYU School of Law began SRP in 2007 as part of NYU\u2019s Education Law &amp; Policy Society (Ed Law) to help address the tremendous need to increase access to quality representation for low-income students and parents facing suspension hearings. In the spring of 2009, SRP became a stand-alone student organization, with built in leadership links to the Ed Law Board.   SRP pairs new law student advocates with experienced law student advocates in its attempt to provide excellent training for law students and excellent advocacy for clients. SRP enables law students to develop valuable legal skills including interviewing clients, conducting direct and cross examinations, and delivering closing arguments. SRP routinely helps to shorten the length of the suspension or eliminate the suspension, helping kids stay in school. SRP also participates in coalitions in NYC to try to improve the ways that schools respond to students\u2019 behavior.

A     graphical model is a probabilistic model, where the     conditional dependencies between the random variables are     specified via a graph. Graphical models provide a flexible     framework for modeling large collections of variables with     complex interactions, as evidenced by their wide domain of     application, including for example machine learning,     computer vision, speech and computational biology. This     course will provide a comprehensive survey of learning and     inference methods in graphical models.

I recommend the latest (4th) printing, as the     earlier editions had many typos. You can     tell which printing you have as follows: check the     inside cover, below the \"Library of Congress\"     information. If it says \"10 9 8 ... 4\" you've got the     (correct) fourth print.                Mailing list: To subscribe to the class list,     follow instructions here .

However, when being stuck on a problem, I encourage     you to collaborate with other students in the class, subject    to the following rules:               You may discuss a problem with any student in this     class, and work together on solving it. This can involve     brainstorming and verbally discussing the problem, going     together through possible solutions, but should not      involve one student telling another a complete solution.                Once you solve the homework, you must write up      your solutions on your own , without looking at     other people's write-ups or giving your write-up to     others.                In your solution for each problem, you must write      down the names of any person with whom you     discussed it. This will not affect your grade.                Do not consult solution manuals or other people's     solutions from similar courses.           Late submission policy : During the    semester you are allowed at most two extensions on the    homework assignment. Each extension is for at most 48 hours    and carries a penalty of 25% off your assignment."}]}]
