On content pages, the dominant element is always situated in the left top corner of a page. This is where the title and primary content is located. Everything else on the page is considered secondary to this main element, but secondary elements also have a hierarchy.   Separate Content: Defining what is &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;Secondary&quot;   The informational content on a Web site can have various content types: It can be displayed as text, images, videos, multimedia presentations, audio files, slideshows, or promotions. Within every content type, it is important to separate the \u201cmost important\u201d from the \u201cleast important\u201d \u2013 or in our terms, \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d content \u2013 and classify the hierarchy of importance of what we would like to communicate to the public (site viewer).   Considering the interactive character of the internet and the limited space on the screen, it is important to wisely determine your site\u2019s most important goals when choosing to publish the content.   Main text content can have other related content. For example: photo galleries or videos, interactive forms, or multimedia presentations. It is up to the author to determine what the most important, related content is and its hierarchy within the page.   Making choices is the key to successful layout. Some believe every topic is important and so it may be hard to make these choices. However, they do have to be made, particularly when one subject leads into another, or because it is easier to read from primary to secondary content then reading an undistinguished block of the same size content.           Photography   Photography used on the NYU.edu site must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website.   We recommend using the NYU Photo Bureau for University photography needs to help ensure that you have both the appropriate level of quality and the permission to use images on the University website.        Graphics   While the use of graphics on the NYU.edu website is limited, any graphics used must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website, and must follow guidelines provided in the University Identity and Style Guide .   We recommend using high-quality graphics created by designers rather than line or clip art.         Videos   We recommend that videos on the web are no longer than 2 minutes in length and don't require proprietary software for site viewers to watch. We also strongly recommend that all videos contain captions.     NYU.edu uses the JW Player by LongTail as its local video player.

Below are examples and contact information for questions.   Special Note: To produce the most effective communications and have the greatest impact, it's recommended that a department hire a professional graphic designer to create its materials.        Layouts   In general, the following recommendations should be considered when designing print and online communications. The design of NYU communications reflect on the reputation of the University.     Simple Layouts  Complex layouts are harder to read, scan, and analyze. Layouts that are clutter free are more professional and allow the reader to understand quickly the key benefits and call to action of the communications   Information Hierarchy  Using composition, scale, typography, and images, you can design layouts that help the reader navigate the page from most important to least important information.   Use of White Space  Too often we cover every inch of a page with text. This results in publications that are intimidating and difficult to read. White space is essential to readability. It makes the various elements stand out.   NYU Visual Identity  The use of the NYU logo and the color violet speak volumes about your communication. It gives visual clues to the reader as to whom the communication is coming from, how important it is, and how much attention they should give it. Please have a look at the Logo Basics Guide for recommended usage.              Images   Our digital archive of photographic images includes high-resolution versions for print and low-resolution versions for websites. The library is currently online at picturebank.nyu.edu . For questions concerning photos, please contact Jane Burke at the Photo Bureau.                                   Typography   Gotham is the only font used in the logo and all secondary-level logotypes. It can be used in conjunction with other fonts but should be the primary font for units within the central administration of NYU. As a machine font default, Arial is recommended for letters and HTML docs.

Why should I hire a professional graphic designer?

As monitors get larger so do their aspect ratios, the 960 pixel width offers University authors the ability to use more dynamic content and the site viewer more opportunity to view that content. It also changed our design and visual styles.     Design Foundations   The look of the NYU.edu reflects back on previous versions but looks forward to a more Web 2.0 design that is clean and free of too many flourishes, allowing the content to take the spotlight. After all NYU.edu would not exist if it were not for the content and work done at the university.   There was a process of a number of months to investigate the best design to meet all of the targeted needs and audiences. What has evolved is a strong foundation for the next chapter in NYU\u2019s online presence.        Color Palette   You're probably noticed that NYU's primary color is purple. It's a very specifc color of purple, to be exact. The specifics of &quot;NYU purple&quot; and the subsequent primary and secondary color pallettes is what you're going to see all throughout the NYU.edu site:         Official NYU Purple                               HEX: 57068c; CMYK: C85, M100, Y0, K0; RGB: R87, G6, B140           Primary Colors           Color Hex RGB   NYU Purple 57068c 87,6,140  Link Red d11255 209,18,85   Text Black 23241e 35, 36, 30        Secondary Colors           Color Hex RGB   Gray 818790 128, 135, 143  Blue 448ccb 69, 140, 204  Dark Cyan 005b7f 1, 91, 126  Green 0e7d8e 14, 125, 142  Cyan 0077a2 0, 119, 162  Brown 816c5d 130, 108, 94      Content Elements   Fonts   Gotham is the University's official font family and was created and is provided by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones .   The NYU.edu website uses Verdana as its main system font.   Headers   The NYU.edu site uses headers in logical hierarchy (ex: H2 is sub category of H1 and H3 is subcategory of H2 &amp; etc.). There is only one H1 per page as the page title. This H1 is as close to the convention of the page filename as possible to improve search engine optimization.   We have reserved H6 for accessibility (hidden/ off screen).                H1 HEADER         font-size: 37px   font-family: Gotham Book     H2 HEADER   font-size: 24px   font-family: Gotham Book   H3 HEADER   font-size: 19px   font-family: Gotham Medium   H4 HEADER   font-size: 13px   font-weight: bold   font-family: Verdana, Arial   H5 HEADER   font-size: 12px   font-family: Verdana, Arial                       Layout   Web pages always have a dominant element and a number of additional, peripheral elements. On content pages, the dominant element is always situated in the left top corner of a page. This is where the title and primary content is located. Everything else on the page is considered secondary to this main element, but secondary elements also have a hierarchy.   Separate Content: Defining what is &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;Secondary&quot;   The informational content on a Web site can have various content types: It can be displayed as text, images, videos, multimedia presentations, audio files, slideshows, or promotions. Within every content type, it is important to separate the \u201cmost important\u201d from the \u201cleast important\u201d \u2013 or in our terms, \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d content \u2013 and classify the hierarchy of importance of what we would like to communicate to the public (site viewer).   Considering the interactive character of the internet and the limited space on the screen, it is important to wisely determine your site\u2019s most important goals when choosing to publish the content.   Main text content can have other related content. For example: photo galleries or videos, interactive forms, or multimedia presentations. It is up to the author to determine what the most important, related content is and its hierarchy within the page.   Making choices is the key to successful layout. Some believe every topic is important and so it may be hard to make these choices. However, they do have to be made, particularly when one subject leads into another, or because it is easier to read from primary to secondary content then reading an undistinguished block of the same size content.           Photography   Photography used on the NYU.edu site must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website.   We recommend using the NYU Photo Bureau for University photography needs to help ensure that you have both the appropriate level of quality and the permission to use images on the University website.        Graphics   While the use of graphics on the NYU.edu website is limited, any graphics used must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website, and must follow guidelines provided in the University Identity and Style Guide .   We recommend using high-quality graphics created by designers rather than line or clip art.         Videos   We recommend that videos on the web are no longer than 2 minutes in length and don't require proprietary software for site viewers to watch. We also strongly recommend that all videos contain captions.     NYU.edu uses the JW Player by LongTail as its local video player.

Below are examples and contact information for questions.   Special Note: To produce the most effective communications and have the greatest impact, it's recommended that a department hire a professional graphic designer to create its materials.        Layouts   In general, the following recommendations should be considered when designing print and online communications. The design of NYU communications reflect on the reputation of the University.     Simple Layouts  Complex layouts are harder to read, scan, and analyze. Layouts that are clutter free are more professional and allow the reader to understand quickly the key benefits and call to action of the communications   Information Hierarchy  Using composition, scale, typography, and images, you can design layouts that help the reader navigate the page from most important to least important information.   Use of White Space  Too often we cover every inch of a page with text. This results in publications that are intimidating and difficult to read. White space is essential to readability. It makes the various elements stand out.   NYU Visual Identity  The use of the NYU logo and the color violet speak volumes about your communication. It gives visual clues to the reader as to whom the communication is coming from, how important it is, and how much attention they should give it. Please have a look at the Logo Basics Guide for recommended usage.              Images   Our digital archive of photographic images includes high-resolution versions for print and low-resolution versions for websites. The library is currently online at picturebank.nyu.edu . For questions concerning photos, please contact Jane Burke at the Photo Bureau.                                   Typography   Gotham is the only font used in the logo and all secondary-level logotypes. It can be used in conjunction with other fonts but should be the primary font for units within the central administration of NYU. As a machine font default, Arial is recommended for letters and HTML docs.        The Gotham type font family can be purchased directly from the type foundry, Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones, online at typography.com .

Standards for these renovations have been carefully designed by the classroom standards committee based on data collected from Stern faculty members and research in learning and instructional design. The following table lists room enhancements considered by the committee. Each classroom at a minimum has a standard podium with a networked PC, Wi-Fi, laptop connection, and standard video recording capability. Please review the table below for additional classroom enhancements and their design to facilitate in-class activities.                 Feature      Enhancement      Facilitated in-class activities              Collaborative Layout      Low-tiered floor allows students to rearrange themselves and furniture around the room. Students can see the instructor and presentations clearly, as well as hear each other.                 Allows for student-centered class discussion with instructor guidance.       Allows for collaborative pair and group activities.                        Document Camera      Document camera projects color images of tangible media (books, newspaper articles, etc.).                 Instructors can display and present student work providing an opportunity to view student conceptions and provide immediate feedback.       Instructors can display (or enable students to display) relevant print media to the class.                        Dry-erase Wallpaper      Whiteboard wall paper around the room lets students make their thinking visible to each other and the instructor during collaborative activities.                 Students can co-construct solutions to problems that are shared with others.       Provides opportunity for instructor to see student (mis)conceptions and provide immediate feedback.                        Dual Projection      Two side-by-side projectors can easily present two different items at once. Any two podium devices can be projected simultaneously.                 Instructors can simultaneously present examples and theory or different perspectives to clarify new concepts.       Instructors can simultaneously present images and text that represent the same concept for different types of learners.                        Echo360 Classroom Capture System      Records and synchronizes lecture with output of projected media so students can easily navigate through an indexed recording. Upon request, inks to the lecture are automatically posted to Blackboard.                 Students can easily review topics from recordings.       ESL students have multiple opportunities to view the lectures.                        Movable Chairs      Freestanding chairs allow students to rearrange themselves around the room. In auditoriums, movable desks.                 Allows for collaborative pair and group activities.       Movable desks allows for comfortable note-taking space in this auditorium style classroom.                        Power Outlets      Power outlets are outfitted at every student desk allowing instructors to plan class activities that leverage the new mandatory student laptop policy.                 Students can co-create presentations, perform in-class research, and use tools for problem-solving.       Students can also follow an instructor's computer activity (learning by doing).                        Student Microphones      In select large classrooms students have push-to-talk microphones at their desks.                 Students can engage in clear class discussions.       Provides high quality audio recording that includes both instructor and student participation .                        Tablet      The monitor at the podium has tablet functionality allowing instructors to save annotations to media presented through the podium computer.                 Instructors can work out examples making their expert thought-processes visible to students in a way that can be saved and re-accessed for review.       Presentations are made more dynamic and can be customized according to a particular class discussion.
