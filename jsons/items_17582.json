In the decade since their development, these technologies revolutionized our understanding of the importance of the human white-matter for health and disease. The white matter pathways comprise a set of active wires and the responses and properties of these wires predict human cognitive and emotional abilities in health and disease. Beside excitement, the need for a systematic approach to tractography validation (Pestilli Scientific Data 2015) and a framework to perform statistical model testing can be seen in recent reports in Science that set out to characterize human white matter structure (Van Wedeen et al., Science 2011; Catani et al., Science 2011).   I will present a new method (LiFE, Linear Fascicle Evaluation) to perform both tractography validation and statistical hypotheses testing on the network of brain connections (Pestilli et al., Nature Methods 2014). These new methods improve current techniques in fundamental ways and can be applied to any type of diffusion data. I will show that by using the methods we were able to identify a major white-matter pathway communicating information between the dorsal and ventral visual streams, the Vertical Occipital Fasciculus (VOF; Yeatman, Wiener, Pestilli et al., PNAS 2014; Takemura et al., Cerebral Cortex, In Press).    Beyond the advances to in-vivo white-matter mapping, it is agreed that there is need to improve tractography methods (Sporns, Nature Methods 2012; Catani et al., 2011). I will present a new approach to tractography. Ensemble tractography (Takemura, Wandell and Pestilli, under review) uses the LiFE method and combines a series of connectomes generated with a variety of tractography algorithms and parameters set. We show that Ensemble tractography improves the representation of the white-matter in living brains by best exploiting available data. Connectomes generated using ensemble tractography are denser and represent a wide variety of white-matter properties. For example, connectomes contain both long-range white matter tracts as well as short range u-fibers. These methods can being used to improve the precision by white-matter tracts and connections that can be mapped and to related their properties to human perception and cognition.

These sites include the NYU Langone Clinical Cancer Center, Center for Women\u2019s Imaging, Center for Women\u2019s Health, Gramercy Park Radiology (new), Columbus Radiology, Bellevue and Gouverneur Hospital.   Diagnostic services include high-resolution 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), low-dose digital mammography, ultrasonography, and conventional radiography. Interventional services include Ultrasound, stereotactic, and MRI guided core biopsies, Ultrasound guided fine needle aspirations (FNA), galactography, and needle localizations. Each of our 14 radiologists are fellowship trained in Breast Imaging and practice solely breast imaging.\u00a0 Our specialty-trained staff is world-renowned in the fields of diagnostic and interventional breast radiology, publishing regularly in prestigious peer-reviewed journals and lecturing at breast and radiology meetings around the world.   We are proud to announce that NYU Langone Clinical Cancer Center and Bellevue have received The American College of Radiology\u2019s (ACR) designation as a \u201cBreast Imaging Center of Excellence\u201d.   This signifies that our Breast Imaging Center provides services to our community at the highest standards of the Radiology profession. The Breast Imaging Center has been given this distinction for two consecutive years. This designation is awarded only if the center has achieved accreditation by the ACR in stereotactic breast biopsy, breast ultrasound and ultrasound guided breast biopsy and by the ACR or an FDA approved state credentialing body in mammography.
