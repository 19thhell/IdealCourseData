is the study of human experience, considered in relation to particular times and places. It is also a method of thinking characterized by its attention to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. Students of history gain invaluable skills and techniques when they master this method of thinking. They learn to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, and political; to organize it into a coherent whole; and to present it clearly in written or oral form. In the process, students also learn to justify and question their own and others\u2019 conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed, rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important and most interesting tasks of the historian. Faculty and students in history are engaged in the study of a wide range of historical questions, focusing on different time periods and different geographic regions.   The goal of the History major is to provide students with both a foundation of historical knowledge and the tools to undertake their own historical research, using primary documents when possible, in ways that meet the highest intellectual standards.   The major in History prepares students for graduate work, teaching, and for any of the many professions that benefit from analytical thinking and argumentation, including politics, law, medicine, and business, as well as furnishing the wherewithal for lifelong personal enrichment. The NYUAD History major focuses on global history, conceived in terms of four overlapping regions:      Indian Ocean World , which includes not just the areas and countries bordering the ocean basin but also the areas corresponding to the historic scope of the Ottoman and Mughal empires, Persia, parts of Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and parts of the South Pacific.       Asia-Pacific World , which includes areas corresponding to the historic scope of the Mongol, Qing, and Russian empires, Northeast Asia, parts of Central and Inner Asia, parts of Southeast Asia, Australasia, and the Americas.       Atlantic World , which encompasses Europe (including Russia and the USSR), the Americas, West Africa, and the Caribbean.       Mediterranean World , which encompasses all those areas adjacent to the Mediterranean and contiguous seas, including the historic scope of the Habsburg, Venetian, and Ottoman empires, parts of southern and central Europe, North Africa, and the Near East.     Certain History courses may be able to count towards more than one regional field within the major. A student who wishes to use a particular course to fulfill a requirement in a field other than the one under which the course is listed may request permission from the mentor. A single course can fulfill only one field.   History majors are required to take The Theory and Practice of History and a minimum of seven elective courses distributed as follows: at least one global thematic course; at least two courses in different regional areas (Indian Ocean, Asia-Pacific, Atlantic, and Mediterranean); at least one course that primarily covers a period before 1800; and at least one course from Arts and Humanities Colloquia. Courses in the Core Curriculum or other concentrations may also count toward the major if approved by the student\u2019s mentor.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

ACS-AD 202 Paradise Lost: Muslims, Christians and Jews in al-Andalus                                                                              From the beginning of the 8th to the beginning of the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.

This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the &quot;Arabian Seas.&quot; We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

How does it differ from world history? International history? Transnational history? And why has writing global histories become a new intellectual imperative for historians today? This gateway course for the history program provides students with skills to answer these questions. It challenges them to examine when categories like the nation and civilization enhance or inhibit historical understanding, and to consider alternative units of place and space for historical inquiry.

When and where did these, and other pressing environmental concerns, have their origins? What can history teach us about how we might best address these issues in the present? This course offers a comprehensive overview of the world&rsquo;s environmental history with a focus on the period from 1500 C.E. to the present &ndash; a time marked by a dramatic intensification in the use of land, water, and energy resources. The course&rsquo;s central goal is to understand the relationships between globalization, natural resource and energy use, and environmental change, and to explain how these relationships unfolded, and continue to unfold, differently in major world regions, including the Gulf.

It traces the history of the various protest movements and explores a plethora of national experiences with respect to domestic and transnational networks of dissent as well as global imaginaries. Taking into account the aesthetics and performativity of protest, the course examines the role of cultural practices, action repertoires, the media, visual representations, lifestyle and fashion, the politics of memory, and the impact of dissent on political decision-makers and society at large.

It seeks to answer three fundamental questions: what are the underlying causes of revolution; how and why do revolutions migrate or undergo cultural translation; and to what extent have revolutions become the catalyst for societal (dis/re)organization in modernity. Readings include historical documents as well as theoretical works by Burke, Marx, Lenin, Lukacs, Arendt, Fanon, Debray, and Marcuse.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 120 World War II in Global Perspective                                             The Second World War was the most destructive in human history and has become a touchstone for historical understanding in the postwar period. This course seeks to examine not only the strategic decisions of major belligerent states (Germany, the Soviet Union, Japan, Britain and the United States), but also the transformative power of the war in societies across the globe. Course topics will include the experience of soldiers and civilians, the mobilization of populations within far-flung empires, the use of new weapons and occupation strategies, and the critical social and political consequences of the war on populations across Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the Middle East.

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials.

HIST-AD 127X South Asia in the Indian Ocean World                                                                   This course offers an opportunity for in-depth study of the history and culture of the South Asians who comprise the majority population of the UAE. Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

HIST-AD 130JX Islam in Africa                                                                                          Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa. Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra.

We look at the nuts and bolts of empire building, as well as how cultures of conquest shape identity (especially ethnicity and gender) and regional geopolitics.

The goal of the course is to identify the best ways of asking and answering questions about the widespread environmental challenges that are seemingly inherent in China&rsquo;s economic development. Are the challenges new to Chinese history &ndash; particular to modernization &ndash; or are they rooted in long-standing patterns of land use and resource exploitation? How to do we square the history of damage wrought to nature with the equally salient history of &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; notions of &ldquo;living in harmony&rdquo; with nature, exemplified by philosophical Daoism and millennia of poetic and painting traditions extolling the beauty and wonder of nature? Who, moreover, is entitled to do what with and about the environment: what are the roles of the state?; of scientists and engineers?; of humanists? The course doubles as an introduction to the history of China, and to the multidisciplinary field of environmental studies.

This course looks closely at borderlands between China and other sovereign states, and borderlands between upland and lowland peoples in and around the region that some scholars call &ldquo;Zomia,&rdquo; the elevated parts of mainland Southeast Asia that often lie beyond the reach of governments based in lowland population centers. The course readings raise questions about indigeneity, migration, and state-building in what may be the most ethnically diverse part of the world. It tests the heuristic limits of key historical categories like nation, state, and citizenship, and further explores alternative notions of political and cultural community.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

HIST-AD 163 Ideas into Ideologies: Nineteenth-Century German Ideas and Their Global Legacies                                                        What makes ideas historical? How do ideas travel beyond their originating contexts and become embedded in different temporal, linguistic, and cultural settings, often with vastly unexpected consequences? How do intellectuals feature as cultural agents and producers of ideology in such processes? The course explores these and other issues by following the trajectories of some influential ideas articulated in German letters during the &ldquo;Long Nineteenth Century&rdquo; (1789&ndash;1914) and seeks to explain the diverse European and global legacies they inspired during and after this period. Focusing on the interplay between theory and practice, the course investigates how such ideas changed in the course of their dissemination, appropriation, and re-interpretation, in ways that radically transformed the modern world.

HIST-AD 169 From the &quot;Chilean Road to Socialism&quot; to the Pinochet Era: Chile and the Global Cold War                                                         This course explores some of Latin America&rsquo;s most significant social and political events during the Cold War: the democratic election in 1970 of a Marxist president in Chile, his overthrow by a military coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1973, and the installation of a military regime led by General Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1989. During this period, Chile attracted the world&rsquo;s attention for many different reasons. Among them was the experimental nature of its social and political transformations, namely a democratic transition to socialism, as well as the authoritarian implantation of neo-liberal policies.    This course seeks to understand both of these experiments, focusing on their global connections beyond the well-known diplomatic tensions of the Cold War. Along with an analysis of Chile&#39;s social structure, political system, and economic history, this course will highlight the importance of gender roles, subaltern agency, and popular movements. Finally, the course will also address the traumatic dimension of Chile&rsquo;s Cold War experience trough the study of violence, truth, and memory during Pinochet&rsquo;s regime.

It will begin with an overview of the Mongol empire and its legacies in Central Asia and the broader Muslim world. We will compare the emerging post-Mongol Eurasian and Ottoman states through the lenses of law, political legitimacy, succession, and ruling institutions. We will then compare Russian and Ottoman civilizing missions, imperial nationalisms, treatments of sectarianism and ethnic minorities, constitutionalisms, public health policies, responses to Islamic modernism, Marxist and other radical leftist ideas, and women&rsquo;s emancipation. The course will conclude by considering how post-imperial modernization projects transformed identity, gender, and religion in Central Asia and the Middle East.

What picture of the human being emerged with this turn? How did the turn toward the Classics contribute to the development of modern humanism? How was this humanism itself taken up in the Enlightenment and the development of modern education systems, and what remains of humanism today?    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research.

The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research. In the tutorial, students work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty director to hone their research and produce successive drafts of a senior thesis. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the senior thesis.

This class examines each key stage, combining readings with in situ urban inquiry. Readings cover Chinese reflections on the city in general and Shanghai in particular, as well as urban studies classics like Lewis Mumford&rsquo;s The Culture of Cities Trips take students to historically significant cultural spaces, including the old City God Temple, Fuzhou Road Bookshops, alleyway houses, The Peace Hotel, the Great World amusement park, People&rsquo;s Park, the Moganshan Road contemporary art complex, as well as nearby waterway towns that illustrate aspects of Shanghai&rsquo;s history before urbanization.

Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

This course surveys (a) the history of the capitalist system from Dutch and British hegemony through the American 20th century, the growth of corporations, various approaches to economic development, and the current opening up of the world to new economic powers, and (b) the related political history of European colonialism, nationalism, postcolonial societies, the Cold War, and the emerging multipolar world of today.

They may do so by sending a  copy of the syllabus and attaching a course petition: http://history.as.nyu.edu/object/history.ug.forms   to the Undergraduate Administrator at history.undergrad@nyu.edu .

is the study of human experience, considered in relation to particular times and places. It is also a method of thinking characterized by its attention to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. Students of history gain invaluable skills and techniques when they master this method of thinking. They learn to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, and political; to organize it into a coherent whole; and to present it clearly in written or oral form. In the process, students also learn to justify and question their own and others\u2019 conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed, rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important and most interesting tasks of the historian. Faculty and students in history are engaged in the study of a wide range of historical questions, focusing on different time periods and different geographic regions.   The goal of the History major is to provide students with both a foundation of historical knowledge and the tools to undertake their own historical research, using primary documents when possible, in ways that meet the highest intellectual standards.   The major in History prepares students for graduate work, teaching, and for any of the many professions that benefit from analytical thinking and argumentation, including politics, law, medicine, and business, as well as furnishing the wherewithal for lifelong personal enrichment. The NYUAD History major focuses on global history, conceived in terms of four overlapping regions:      Indian Ocean World , which includes not just the areas and countries bordering the ocean basin but also the areas corresponding to the historic scope of the Ottoman and Mughal empires, Persia, parts of Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and parts of the South Pacific.       Asia-Pacific World , which includes areas corresponding to the historic scope of the Mongol, Qing, and Russian empires, Northeast Asia, parts of Central and Inner Asia, parts of Southeast Asia, Australasia, and the Americas.       Atlantic World , which encompasses Europe (including Russia and the USSR), the Americas, West Africa, and the Caribbean.       Mediterranean World , which encompasses all those areas adjacent to the Mediterranean and contiguous seas, including the historic scope of the Habsburg, Venetian, and Ottoman empires, parts of southern and central Europe, North Africa, and the Near East.     Certain History courses may be able to count towards more than one regional field within the major. A student who wishes to use a particular course to fulfill a requirement in a field other than the one under which the course is listed may request permission from the mentor. A single course can fulfill only one field.   History majors are required to take The Theory and Practice of History and a minimum of seven elective courses distributed as follows: at least one global thematic course; at least two courses in different regional areas (Indian Ocean, Asia-Pacific, Atlantic, and Mediterranean); at least one course that primarily covers a period before 1800; and at least one course from Arts and Humanities Colloquia. Courses in the Core Curriculum or other concentrations may also count toward the major if approved by the student\u2019s mentor.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.

This was especially the case during the eight centuries from 711&ndash;1492 when various parts of the Iberian peninsula were ruled over by Muslims. In this course we look both at how what are today Morocco and Spain were connected in this period in both history and imagination, and at how the Spanish colonial presence in Morocco in the 20th century played a important role in the Spanish civil war.

We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the &quot;Arabian Seas.&quot; We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

How does it differ from world history? International history? Transnational history? And why has writing global histories become a new intellectual imperative for historians today? This gateway course for the history program provides students with skills to answer these questions. It challenges them to examine when categories like the nation and civilization enhance or inhibit historical understanding, and to consider alternative units of place and space for historical inquiry.

When and where did these, and other pressing environmental concerns, have their origins? What can history teach us about how we might best address these issues in the present? This course offers a comprehensive overview of the world&rsquo;s environmental history with a focus on the period from 1500 C.E. to the present &ndash; a time marked by a dramatic intensification in the use of land, water, and energy resources. The course&rsquo;s central goal is to understand the relationships between globalization, natural resource and energy use, and environmental change, and to explain how these relationships unfolded, and continue to unfold, differently in major world regions, including the Gulf.

It traces the history of the various protest movements and explores a plethora of national experiences with respect to domestic and transnational networks of dissent as well as global imaginaries. Taking into account the aesthetics and performativity of protest, the course examines the role of cultural practices, action repertoires, the media, visual representations, lifestyle and fashion, the politics of memory, and the impact of dissent on political decision-makers and society at large.

It seeks to answer three fundamental questions: what are the underlying causes of revolution; how and why do revolutions migrate or undergo cultural translation; and to what extent have revolutions become the catalyst for societal (dis/re)organization in modernity. Readings include historical documents as well as theoretical works by Burke, Marx, Lenin, Lukacs, Arendt, Fanon, Debray, and Marcuse.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 120 World War II in Global Perspective                                             The Second World War was the most destructive in human history and has become a touchstone for historical understanding in the postwar period. This course seeks to examine not only the strategic decisions of major belligerent states (Germany, the Soviet Union, Japan, Britain and the United States), but also the transformative power of the war in societies across the globe. Course topics will include the experience of soldiers and civilians, the mobilization of populations within far-flung empires, the use of new weapons and occupation strategies, and the critical social and political consequences of the war on populations across Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the Middle East.

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials.

HIST-AD 127X South Asia in the Indian Ocean World                                                                   This course offers an opportunity for in-depth study of the history and culture of the South Asians who comprise the majority population of the UAE. Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

HIST-AD 130JX Islam in Africa                                                                                          Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa. Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra.

We look at the nuts and bolts of empire building, as well as how cultures of conquest shape identity (especially ethnicity and gender) and regional geopolitics.

The goal of the course is to identify the best ways of asking and answering questions about the widespread environmental challenges that are seemingly inherent in China&rsquo;s economic development. Are the challenges new to Chinese history &ndash; particular to modernization &ndash; or are they rooted in long-standing patterns of land use and resource exploitation? How to do we square the history of damage wrought to nature with the equally salient history of &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; notions of &ldquo;living in harmony&rdquo; with nature, exemplified by philosophical Daoism and millennia of poetic and painting traditions extolling the beauty and wonder of nature? Who, moreover, is entitled to do what with and about the environment: what are the roles of the state?; of scientists and engineers?; of humanists? The course doubles as an introduction to the history of China, and to the multidisciplinary field of environmental studies.

This course looks closely at borderlands between China and other sovereign states, and borderlands between upland and lowland peoples in and around the region that some scholars call &ldquo;Zomia,&rdquo; the elevated parts of mainland Southeast Asia that often lie beyond the reach of governments based in lowland population centers. The course readings raise questions about indigeneity, migration, and state-building in what may be the most ethnically diverse part of the world. It tests the heuristic limits of key historical categories like nation, state, and citizenship, and further explores alternative notions of political and cultural community.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

HIST-AD 163 Ideas into Ideologies: Nineteenth-Century German Ideas and Their Global Legacies                                                        What makes ideas historical? How do ideas travel beyond their originating contexts and become embedded in different temporal, linguistic, and cultural settings, often with vastly unexpected consequences? How do intellectuals feature as cultural agents and producers of ideology in such processes? The course explores these and other issues by following the trajectories of some influential ideas articulated in German letters during the &ldquo;Long Nineteenth Century&rdquo; (1789&ndash;1914) and seeks to explain the diverse European and global legacies they inspired during and after this period. Focusing on the interplay between theory and practice, the course investigates how such ideas changed in the course of their dissemination, appropriation, and re-interpretation, in ways that radically transformed the modern world.

HIST-AD 169 From the &quot;Chilean Road to Socialism&quot; to the Pinochet Era: Chile and the Global Cold War                                                         This course explores some of Latin America&rsquo;s most significant social and political events during the Cold War: the democratic election in 1970 of a Marxist president in Chile, his overthrow by a military coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1973, and the installation of a military regime led by General Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1989. During this period, Chile attracted the world&rsquo;s attention for many different reasons. Among them was the experimental nature of its social and political transformations, namely a democratic transition to socialism, as well as the authoritarian implantation of neo-liberal policies.    This course seeks to understand both of these experiments, focusing on their global connections beyond the well-known diplomatic tensions of the Cold War. Along with an analysis of Chile&#39;s social structure, political system, and economic history, this course will highlight the importance of gender roles, subaltern agency, and popular movements. Finally, the course will also address the traumatic dimension of Chile&rsquo;s Cold War experience trough the study of violence, truth, and memory during Pinochet&rsquo;s regime.

It will begin with an overview of the Mongol empire and its legacies in Central Asia and the broader Muslim world. We will compare the emerging post-Mongol Eurasian and Ottoman states through the lenses of law, political legitimacy, succession, and ruling institutions. We will then compare Russian and Ottoman civilizing missions, imperial nationalisms, treatments of sectarianism and ethnic minorities, constitutionalisms, public health policies, responses to Islamic modernism, Marxist and other radical leftist ideas, and women&rsquo;s emancipation. The course will conclude by considering how post-imperial modernization projects transformed identity, gender, and religion in Central Asia and the Middle East.

What picture of the human being emerged with this turn? How did the turn toward the Classics contribute to the development of modern humanism? How was this humanism itself taken up in the Enlightenment and the development of modern education systems, and what remains of humanism today?    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research.

The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research. In the tutorial, students work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty director to hone their research and produce successive drafts of a senior thesis. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the senior thesis.

This class examines each key stage, combining readings with in situ urban inquiry. Readings cover Chinese reflections on the city in general and Shanghai in particular, as well as urban studies classics like Lewis Mumford&rsquo;s The Culture of Cities Trips take students to historically significant cultural spaces, including the old City God Temple, Fuzhou Road Bookshops, alleyway houses, The Peace Hotel, the Great World amusement park, People&rsquo;s Park, the Moganshan Road contemporary art complex, as well as nearby waterway towns that illustrate aspects of Shanghai&rsquo;s history before urbanization.

Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

This course surveys (a) the history of the capitalist system from Dutch and British hegemony through the American 20th century, the growth of corporations, various approaches to economic development, and the current opening up of the world to new economic powers, and (b) the related political history of European colonialism, nationalism, postcolonial societies, the Cold War, and the emerging multipolar world of today.

                   Political Science at NYU Abu Dhabi attracts students who are interested in the many important political questions \u2014 conceptual, empirical, policy-oriented \u2014 that societies everywhere face today. How do different political systems affect policy-making? What are the intrinsic and instrumental virtues of democracy? Why do dictatorships survive in many countries, but evolve into democracies in others? Why do countries go to war? What are the connections between internal conflicts (such as civil war) and political or economic development? What are the main characteristics and causes of economic underdevelopment? Why are prosperity and stagnation distributed so unequally, both across countries and within them?   Major in Political Science   The student with a passion for questions such as these finds the Political Science major most rewarding. The philosophy underlying the courses has several distinctive features. First, the major has a strong analytical focus, with two required courses that introduce students to statistics and models of political behavior and institutions. These courses provide an introduction to the kinds of tools used by social scientists to conduct a deep analysis of these questions and to test the analysis using quantitative data. Second, the major offers many substantive courses, wherein these analytical tools are applied to important policy questions of considerable current interest. Third, the courses in the major include discussions of classic texts that illuminate both the intellectual history and the broader dimensions of these policy questions. Finally, the major offers several courses jointly with programs in Economics, Psychology, and Philosophy, providing students with exciting interdisciplinary opportunities.   Majors in Political Science take two required courses (Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Introduction to Political Thinking), two principal electives, and four general electives. The general electives are organized in the following areas: Methods; Political Theory and Institutions; Comparative Politics; and International Politics. In senior year, every student majoring in Political Science takes a two-course sequence of seminars, culminating in the production of a senior thesis in Political Science. During the first semester, students in Senior Seminar 1 develop a research question, construct a research design that allow them to test potential answers to that question, and collect relevant data.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

As students of business, it is critically important for you to have an understanding of the key factors that contribute to organizational success, and the role that managers play in helping their organizations be successful. The better that you understand these issues, the more effective you will be in your future careers.

We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Although policy makers often regard education as a means to promote greater equality and opportunity, empirical evidence suggests that more often than not, a child&rsquo;s background predicts how well they will perform in school and what types of employment opportunities will be available to them later in life. However, some nations do a better job than others in using education to expand opportunity. Understanding why some nations continue to have schools that struggle in their efforts to serve minorities and the poor children, and why other nations are experiencing greater success in this endeavor is the central aim of this course. We will also consider the ways in which teachers, students, parents and their allies, have used educational settings and the educational process as a focal point for resistance to social and cultural reproduction, and various forms of oppression and discrimination. The role of social identities related to class, race, language and ethnicity in shaping the experiences of students and teachers in the reproduction process, will be a primary focus of the course readings and class discussions.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

In course readings and papers, we will examine how the meanings of &ldquo;nation&rdquo; in China shifted across the past century. We will also intersperse our classes with visits to schools and other educational sites, to study contemporary trends and dilemmas in the teaching of nationalism. At the end of the course, we will ask what other national school systems might learn from China&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, danger, and opportunity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 169 From the &quot;Chilean Road to Socialism&quot; to the Pinochet Era: Chile and the Global Cold War                                                         This course explores some of Latin America&rsquo;s most significant social and political events during the Cold War: the democratic election in 1970 of a Marxist president in Chile, his overthrow by a military coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1973, and the installation of a military regime led by General Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1989. During this period, Chile attracted the world&rsquo;s attention for many different reasons. Among them was the experimental nature of its social and political transformations, namely a democratic transition to socialism, as well as the authoritarian implantation of neo-liberal policies.    This course seeks to understand both of these experiments, focusing on their global connections beyond the well-known diplomatic tensions of the Cold War. Along with an analysis of Chile&#39;s social structure, political system, and economic history, this course will highlight the importance of gender roles, subaltern agency, and popular movements. Finally, the course will also address the traumatic dimension of Chile&rsquo;s Cold War experience trough the study of violence, truth, and memory during Pinochet&rsquo;s regime.

LAW-AD 114J Punishment in Politics, Law and Society                                                                              This seminar investigates the state&rsquo;s power to punish. We read foundational works from philosophy, sociology, political science, and law to explore why states punish, how they punish, and whom they punish. We focus on the modern American approach to punishment, including its use of mass incarceration and the death penalty. We analyze U.S. Supreme Court cases in light of the fundamental purposes of punishment, and compare penal practices around the world. Though subject to change, activities outside the classroom may include attending arraignment court, observing a sentencing hearing, and visiting a correctional facility.

Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The changing nature and media of contemporary globalized lawyering, and web-based access to what were traditionally arcane written sources of law, also renders a multi-media approach to the syllabus desirable. Reported cases will be mixed with film, television, and web-based depictions of legal norms. The course will examine the history, philosophy, method and disciplines of civil and common law. The course will provide students with a critical understanding of legal concepts, an introduction to the divisions of legal doctrine and an understanding of the most pressing issues facing the profession and governments today.

MDENV-AD 115 The Global Debate on Green Growth                                                                    In March 2012, the OECD published its influential Environmental Outlook Report to 2050, confirming that the world is faced with an explosive new cocktail of geopolitical challenges: population explosion, environmental degradation, the failure to stop climate change, and the increased competition over limited natural resources. In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. We will examine how major industrial powers are approaching the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.

PEACE-AD 120 Transitional Justice                                                        How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

PEACE-AD 121 International Organizations and Global Governance                                                        The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the  UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they  provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international system.

PEACE-AD 123 Peacebuilding                                                        This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regions.

What justifies the state&rsquo;s exercise of such authority? Could it be justified because we have at least implicitly given our consent to it? This is only one central question in political philosophy. Others include: What form of government best serves the people? Who are the people, anyway? What is justice? Do we have fundamental rights to property or to free expression? If so, what is the source of these rights? What is freedom, and are there different kinds? What is the proper relation between freedom and equality? Is equality desirable? Can we live in a genuine community that is not a community of equals? As we grapple with such questions, we draw on writings from both classical and contemporary philosophers.

Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design.

POLSC-AD 116 Experimental Research in the Social Sciences                                                        In recent years, social scientists are increasingly using experimental methods in their research. This course offers an accessible introduction to the principles of social scientific experimentation and its uses. All types of social science experiments are explored: laboratory experiments, survey experiments, field experiments, and the new use of &quot;lab-in-the-field&quot; experiments. The course will discuss the issues of validity and artificiality in experimentation as well as the ethical concerns involved in experimental research. Students will have the opportunity to create and design their own experiment as part of the class.

The course focuses on individual decision makers in the world of politics (citizens, voters, legislators, executives, judges) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape political outcomes. Students study the formal modeling of political behavior and analyze the theories of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action). The course also explores how political institutions, such as electoral rules or the design of legislatures, can structure the interactions of these actors. The course relies on cases and examples and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to illustrate how these models of political behavior and institutions can shed light on current political events.

In this course we will draw on both theory and evidence to investigate the interplay between voters&rsquo; preferences and electoral processes. We will focus on the current academic literature as well as elections that have taken place recently. Each week we will discuss and analyze a current election. Each semester the course will also involve an in depth examination of an election taking place during the semester, taking a class trip to meet individuals involved in the election process in that country. In Spring 2016 we will study and visit the Philippines which will be having a general election in early May and also discuss the presidential nomination process which will be taking place in the United States during the semester as well.

This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

Particular emphasis is placed on the United States, although international comparisons are also present. The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange.

Eckstein considers the political culture approach as \"one of the two still viable general approaches to political theory and explanation&hellip;the other still being political rational choice theory.\" This course examines major approaches to political culture and their relationship to democratic development. We discuss questions of how to define political culture, how political culture can be studied, and how it relates to democratic politics and political performance. The pros and cons of the political culture approach will be discussed in the concluding session.

POLSC-AD 140J Introduction to Machiavelli                                                        Often described as the founder of the modern science of politics, Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli (1469&ndash;1527) was also a Florentine diplomat and civil servant who drew upon his deep understanding of Roman history to interpret the colorful, tumultuous, duplicitous, and often violent politics of Renaissance Italy. This class involves a careful reading and analysis of his masterpiece, The Prince, in its historical context, with a focus on its principal theme, namely how and why political leaders gain and lose power. Students also study selected portions of The Discourses. In order to understand the nature of Machiavelli&rsquo;s &quot;republicanism&quot; and how it relates to the advice and warnings he gave to princes. Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to Machiavelli&rsquo;s tomb in Santa Croce; the David of Verrocchio in the Bargello (a statue that Machiavelli saw every day on his way to his office); and the estate at Sant&rsquo;Andrea in Percussina, near San Casciano in Val di Pesa, where Machiavelli retired to write The Prince.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 141X Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory                                                                                         Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

POLSC-AD 142 Justice: Political Theory &amp; Practice                                                                              This course invites students to engage with several classic treatises of political thinking about a universal concern: justice. In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-&shy;\u2010arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know?  In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:  1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?  2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?  3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality?

POLSC-AD 143 Gender Parity                                              This course introduces students to the basic theories, empiricism and methodological concepts of women&#39;s and gender studies within political science. Following an overview session about global and regional patterns, each of the subsequent weeks will tackle a series of key gender and politics topics in turn. The course goes beyond gender inequality in the labor market to explore patterns of violence and political participation, among others. Lastly, the course provides basis for research, practical action and policy formulation and for evaluating directions and strategies for social change from a gender perspective.

POLSC-AD 150 Introduction to Comparative Politics                                             This course introduces students to the study of comparative politics and the study of domestic political institutions around the world. The course emphasizes the use of theory and evidence to generate and test hypotheses about both the causes and the consequences of the observed variation in domestic political institutions. For example, the course investigates the factors that lead some countries to democratize, and others to institute authoritarian governments, as well as the consequences of those institutional choices for policy outcomes. The course also looks at the variations in institutional arrangements within both democratic and non-democratic governments.

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

What explains the variation in the types of regimes&mdash;democratic and authoritarian&mdash; across South Asia? To what extent do these countries vary in the structure of their states as well as regimes? How does ethnic diversity affect the politics of South Asian countries? What is the pattern of economic growth across these countries, and their human development record and why? What explains the high levels of violence in some South Asian countries and patterns of variation across these countries? These are some of the questions that this course addresses, with a primary focus on India and a secondary focus on Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, and Bhutan. Although students learn a vast number of facts about the history and politics of the region, the primary purpose of the course is to identify overarching patterns that characterize the politics of these regions&mdash;and to teach students to think analytically and comparatively about these patterns.

With regard to the EU, classical governance issues of popular representation and accountable elite decision-making are both sharply drawn and the subject of explicit agreements between states. These same issues were explicitly confronted in the recent past by those involved in democratization and democratic consolidation central and eastern Europe. Western Europe is the intellectual \"home\" to many of the classical models of popular representation and accountable elite decision-making, yet all countries, and especially smaller countries, are now forced to adapt these models in a setting where the traditional notion of the \"stand alone\" nation-state is becoming ever less relevant.

They design and execute a public opinion survey of U.S. and Arab attitudes in order to better understand how each side sees the other&mdash;using the poll-driven data to measure the gaps in understanding. The course also includes a televised town hall discussion with the students as participants engaging each other and peers from across the region in an examination of the topic.

It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

The question remains, though, of how exactly does it matter? This is the focus of our course. In the morning sessions, student are first introduced to the most important topics of political behavior&mdash;voting, turnout, partisanship, public opinion formation, and protests and social movements&mdash;and then to the much newer literature on the usage of social media. In the afternoon sessions, students both visit social media companies located in New York City, and are taught the necessary tools to work on their own original research projects. These research projects are conducted in conjunction with NYU&rsquo;s new Social Media and Political Participation laboratory (smapp.nyu.edu).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 161 Comparative Politics of Africa                                             The goal of this course is to introduce participants to the study of African politics from multiple methodological approaches and in a number of African contexts. The course begins with the historical roots of contemporary African politics, exploring how pre-colonial institutions and colonialism shaped African politics at independence. Then, we survey the political and economic strategies of leaders post-independence and the factors shaping those strategies. We examine the causes and consequences of poor governance, and evaluate the recent patterns of redemocratization on the continent. The course closes with a discussion of present-day challenges: electoral malfeasance, public health crises, the &ldquo;new&rdquo; populism, and China in Africa.    * Recommended prerequisite: POLSC-AD 150.

We are especially concerned with analytically exploring major issues in international politics, such as the causes of war, the emergence of cooperative trade relations between states, the origins and functioning of international organizations such as the United Nations, and the political determinants of financial crises. The focus of the course is neither historical nor descriptive; rather, it requires students to exercise skills in logic and to think of imaginative ways to apply subtle techniques to gain a clearer grasp of the above political issues.

This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &quot;democracy promotion&quot; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency. Students then travel to Kathmandu, Nepal to meet with participants in Nepal's 10-year civil war from 1996 to 2006 and learn their perspectives on these questions obtained from their experiences.

We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

The industrial revolution initially occurred in locations where coal was available. The discovery of oil, which provided a more transportable and more powerful source of energy, launched international competition for control of sources of oil. Oil cartels and powerful transnational oil companies have played vital roles in the politics, economics, and international policies of developed and developing nations, and access to oil has shaped the relationship of the Middle East to the world from the early 20th century to the present. This course explores these historical developments and considers how the need for energy has defined domestic politics and world developments over the past two centuries. Taking advantage of our location in Abu Dhabi, the course explores the relationship of an oil-producing region to the rest of the world.

The course will consider the emerging &quot;market&quot; or economic discussion, reviewing what academics, the press, financial institutions, etc., mean when they speak of these countries, with acronyms such as BRICs, BRICS, MINT, and others. What is the key factor: size, growth, novelty, potential or promise? Which of all of these questions is truly relevant and important? The second part of the class will examine regional, geopolitical issues: are these countries important actors in their regions? Why or why not, and how does their economic performance influence their regional political action (domestic ideological and institutional issues would also be rapidly addressed here)? The third part of the class will turn to international and multilateral factors: are &quot;emerging powers&quot; truly powers? Are they all the same? Do others see them as powers? How do they express their economic success or geographic and demographic clout in the international arena?    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 184 UN: Negotiation towards A New Binding &amp; Universal Agreement on Climate Change in Paris in Dec 2015                                                                   The United Nations (UN) provides the forum where states come together to discuss mutual problems. In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions.

POLSC-AD 209 Data Analysis                                                                              Social scientists and policy analysts rely heavily on research drawing on observational data. Students learn to manage and analyze such data and to deploy statistical techniques that are common in these applications, with an emphasis on how to translate social science theory into empirical research. Topics include review of basic regression analysis, building multivariate analytical models, and regression analysis with limited dependent variables. The course emphasizes practical training in these skills as well as evaluation, replication, and critical analysis of research conducted in the social science literature. The course assumes knowledge of the material covered in Statistics for Social and Behavioral Sciences and is designed as alternative for students in the social sciences who are not taking Introduction to Econometrics.    Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for a Politics elective.

SOCSC-AD 101 Mathematics for Social Sciences I                                                                   This course provides an introduction to topics in mathematics immediately relevant for social scientists beginning their studies in Economics, Political Science, or Social Research and Public Policy. Beginning with a review of sets and functions, the course covers key topics in univariate calculus and introduces the notation associated with basic linear algebra. The course is not a study of pure mathematics and so results are presented without rigorous proofs. Instead, the course provides an introduction to mathematics as the lingua franca of modern social sciences, and focuses on employing mathematics to formulate and communicate theories within the social sciences.    *Note: This course is only open to students who started before 2015.

SOCSC-AD 113 Statistics and Probability for the Social Sciences                                                                                                                  The fundamental concepts of probability and the theoretical underpinnings of statistical inference form the foundation for data analysis in the social sciences. To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. We begin the semester with the axioms of probability, from which we develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, we look at both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The course will end with an inference-based look at linear regression.    *Prerequisites: Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111) or Mathematics for Social Scientists I (SOCSC-AD 101)    *Required for Economics majors in the theory track; other students with a focus on quantitative analysis are encouraged to take SOCSC-AD 113 instead of Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences (SOCSC-AD 110). This can be used as a substitute for SOCSC-AD 110.

They are perceived as &lsquo;social problems&rsquo; and divide public opinion about the appropriate ways to protect society from their deleterious effects. Lectures first focus on sociological perspectives on social problems and examine the role of social structure and social processes in their production and reproduction. Subsequent lectures focus on exploring selected social problems such as: suicide, suicide terrorism, euthanasia, aging, genocide, incest, genomics, and religious fundamentalism. The selected social problems are examined in a global perspective, focusing on contemporary industrialized societies.

This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (&lsquo;tipping points&rsquo;), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

The course is practice oriented: we will use a lot of examples, you will create your own survey design, and we will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course you will be able to design and implement your own, high quality survey. Moreover, you will question much of the data that is collected by others because you know all the things that can go wrong in the process. For this course I assume that you are comfortable with basic statistics. This course may be substituted with a Methods Elective course.    Prerequisites: SOCSC-AD 112 and (SOCSC-AD 110 or SOCSC-AD 113 or MATH-AD 150).

The key research questions informing this project are: What conceptions do Somalis in Somalia, Ethiopia and the diaspora harbor to address historic and recent violence and how do these relate to Islamic, Somali customary and human rights law? What are the implications of these conceptions and plural legal orders for a place-based approach to transitional justice in protracted conflict?
