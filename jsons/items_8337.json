Applications        NYU Projects        The Profession                                What is Data Science?        There is much debate among scholars and practitioners about what data science is, and what it isn\u2019t. Does it deal only with big data? What constitutes big data? Is data science really that new? How is it different from statistics and analytics?                                One way to consider data science is as an evolutionary step in interdisciplinary fields like business analysis that incorporate computer science, modeling, statistics, analytics, and mathematics.               At its core, data science involves using automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and to extract knowledge from them. With such automated methods turning up everywhere from genomics to high-energy physics, data science is helping to create new branches of science, and influencing areas of social science and the humanities. The trend is expected to accelerate in the coming years as data from mobile sensors, sophisticated instruments, the web, and more, grows. In academic research, we will see an increasingly large number of traditional disciplines spawning new sub-disciplines with the adjective \"computational\" or \u201cquantitative\u201d in front of them. In industry, we will see data science transforming everything from healthcare to media.                          50x        in 2020 the world will generate 50 times the amount of data than in 2011        Source: emc.com                                                       DATA      SCIENCE                                                      Applications                                          Computer Science                                          Mathematical Statistics                                                                                                     Data-Driven Discovery      WHAT DATA SCIENCE MEANS FOR RESEARCH      In virtually all areas of intellectual inquiry, data science offers a powerful new approach to making discoveries. By combining aspects of statistics, computer science, applied mathematics, and visualization, data science can turn the vast amounts of data the digital age generates into new insights and new knowledge.      Click on the icons to the left to see how social scientists, medical researchers, and many others are using data science to advance their fields.               Measuring Happiness      SOCIAL SCIENCE      Facebook and Twitter collect in hours what traditional methods take sociologists months or even years to gather. Hedonometer, a tool created by University of Vermont researchers, is putting that social data to use. It pulls in 50 million tweets each day and matches those tweets against a database of words assigned a happiness value. The higher the Hedonometer number on a particular day, the happier the collective mood of Twitter users, and, presumably a wider group of people. Some findings are predictable: the day of the Boston bombings was the world\u2019s saddest day in five years. Other findings are surprising: Twitter users\u2019 happiness increases the further they move from home.

What drives certain goods to stay the same price in the face of changing economic conditions? How much do prices adjust in a country when its exchange rate changes? These are among the questions MIT\u2019s Billion Prices Project aims to answer. The Project collects prices from hundreds of online retailers around the world on a daily basis for economic research.

Their method builds on DNA research from NYU and employs aspects of data science to help engineers design nanomaterials with particular properties. By harnessing a huge and growing body of high throughput experimentation data, the researchers\u2019 approach could replace time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error design methods engineers traditionally use to create new materials, accelerating the time-to-market for new products.

Proprietary platforms, however, can be costly for independent lawyers and small firms, and search methods are limited. Enter a startup like BriefMine out of San Francisco, which is using data science to provide a more affordable, more efficient alternative. Within its growing repository of documents, BriefMine\u2019s technology identifies data points, conducts trend analysis, and develops scoring frameworks based on relevance and natural language search.

According to McKinsey Quarterly, \u201cbig data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function much as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition.\u201d To get the most out of that asset, companies are turning to data scientists to collect, integrate, and analyze data. Schools like NYU have developed degree programs to fill the growing gap between the number of trained data scientists and the needs of businesses.

Sinai offered an example at DataBeat 2013 of how data science can help discover diseases that researchers don\u2019t even know to look for. Mt. Sinai has a unique resource: clinical data from 25,000 patients and their genomic data. Researchers could cross-reference the two types of data and isolate smaller populations of people who may share traits. For instance, a group who are diabetic may be prone to one particular disease, and another group of diabetic patients, prone to another disease. This might illuminate a new form of diabetes, and lead to more personalized treatment.

Deblurring that optical data to find exoplanets requires new ways to represent images. One of the most efficient deblurring methods comes from recent advances in applied mathematics. But efficiently computing these sparse representations requires new optimization methods involving statistical inference in complex Bayesian models. With data science, we can bring techniques from different disciplines together, aiding the hunt for planets outside our solar system.

Business environments aren\u2019t the only ones that require context; context is a necessity for any attempt to know more by examining data.                                                                                                                                                                             About     The data science initiative at New York University is a university-wide effort to establish the country\u2019s leading data science training and research facilities at NYU. It was launched to help meet the world\u2019s demand for researchers and professionals skilled in developing and utilizing automated methods of analyzing data. The initiative is especially focused on harnessing the potential power of big data to transform areas ranging from healthcare to business to government. Data science overlaps traditionally strong disciplines at NYU such as mathematics, statistics and computer science. It also stands to impact disciplines in which NYU\u2019s schools and departments are actively engaged, such as economics, law and sociology.

CSCI-UA. 480-001   11295   Special Topics In Computer Science: Computing with Large Data Sets   prereq: CSCI-UA.0201  Enormous collections of data in multiple fields of science and engineering are being gathered and need to be analyzed. For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey will represent more than 200 million objects, each with 100 dimensions, and other activities in physics, biology, astronomy, and medicine will soon gather ever-larger sets of data. Biology, and more specifically the field of systems biology, have seen massive improvements in the technologies we use to sequence genomes and measure the levels of gene expression (or activity) in cells under different conditions.    These large biology data sets have have features in common with large data sets arising in other fields and illustrate the general need for tools for analysis, manipulation and statistical analysis of large data sets. This course will discuss some of the associated unprecedented computational challenges, focusing on these very large data sets arising in computational biology. The course is intended to addre ss some of the needed general principles by using a high-level language, the R statistical programming language, to analyze large genomic data sets. We will focus on four main data-sets in this class that come from current genomics and systems-biology studies; the needed biology and statistics will be taught throughout the course.

Applications        NYU Projects        The Profession                                What is Data Science?        There is much debate among scholars and practitioners about what data science is, and what it isn\u2019t. Does it deal only with big data? What constitutes big data? Is data science really that new? How is it different from statistics and analytics?                                One way to consider data science is as an evolutionary step in interdisciplinary fields like business analysis that incorporate computer science, modeling, statistics, analytics, and mathematics.               At its core, data science involves using automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and to extract knowledge from them. With such automated methods turning up everywhere from genomics to high-energy physics, data science is helping to create new branches of science, and influencing areas of social science and the humanities. The trend is expected to accelerate in the coming years as data from mobile sensors, sophisticated instruments, the web, and more, grows. In academic research, we will see an increasingly large number of traditional disciplines spawning new sub-disciplines with the adjective \"computational\" or \u201cquantitative\u201d in front of them. In industry, we will see data science transforming everything from healthcare to media.                          50x        in 2020 the world will generate 50 times the amount of data than in 2011        Source: emc.com                                                       DATA      SCIENCE                                                      Applications                                          Computer Science                                          Mathematical Statistics                                                                                                     Data-Driven Discovery      WHAT DATA SCIENCE MEANS FOR RESEARCH      In virtually all areas of intellectual inquiry, data science offers a powerful new approach to making discoveries. By combining aspects of statistics, computer science, applied mathematics, and visualization, data science can turn the vast amounts of data the digital age generates into new insights and new knowledge.      Click on the icons to the left to see how social scientists, medical researchers, and many others are using data science to advance their fields.               Measuring Happiness      SOCIAL SCIENCE      Facebook and Twitter collect in hours what traditional methods take sociologists months or even years to gather. Hedonometer, a tool created by University of Vermont researchers, is putting that social data to use. It pulls in 50 million tweets each day and matches those tweets against a database of words assigned a happiness value. The higher the Hedonometer number on a particular day, the happier the collective mood of Twitter users, and, presumably a wider group of people. Some findings are predictable: the day of the Boston bombings was the world\u2019s saddest day in five years. Other findings are surprising: Twitter users\u2019 happiness increases the further they move from home.

What drives certain goods to stay the same price in the face of changing economic conditions? How much do prices adjust in a country when its exchange rate changes? These are among the questions MIT\u2019s Billion Prices Project aims to answer. The Project collects prices from hundreds of online retailers around the world on a daily basis for economic research.

Their method builds on DNA research from NYU and employs aspects of data science to help engineers design nanomaterials with particular properties. By harnessing a huge and growing body of high throughput experimentation data, the researchers\u2019 approach could replace time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error design methods engineers traditionally use to create new materials, accelerating the time-to-market for new products.

Proprietary platforms, however, can be costly for independent lawyers and small firms, and search methods are limited. Enter a startup like BriefMine out of San Francisco, which is using data science to provide a more affordable, more efficient alternative. Within its growing repository of documents, BriefMine\u2019s technology identifies data points, conducts trend analysis, and develops scoring frameworks based on relevance and natural language search.

According to McKinsey Quarterly, \u201cbig data may well become a new type of corporate asset that will cut across business units and function much as a powerful brand does, representing a key basis for competition.\u201d To get the most out of that asset, companies are turning to data scientists to collect, integrate, and analyze data. Schools like NYU have developed degree programs to fill the growing gap between the number of trained data scientists and the needs of businesses.

Sinai offered an example at DataBeat 2013 of how data science can help discover diseases that researchers don\u2019t even know to look for. Mt. Sinai has a unique resource: clinical data from 25,000 patients and their genomic data. Researchers could cross-reference the two types of data and isolate smaller populations of people who may share traits. For instance, a group who are diabetic may be prone to one particular disease, and another group of diabetic patients, prone to another disease. This might illuminate a new form of diabetes, and lead to more personalized treatment.

Deblurring that optical data to find exoplanets requires new ways to represent images. One of the most efficient deblurring methods comes from recent advances in applied mathematics. But efficiently computing these sparse representations requires new optimization methods involving statistical inference in complex Bayesian models. With data science, we can bring techniques from different disciplines together, aiding the hunt for planets outside our solar system.

Business environments aren\u2019t the only ones that require context; context is a necessity for any attempt to know more by examining data.                                                                                                                                                                             About     The data science initiative at New York University is a university-wide effort to establish the country\u2019s leading data science training and research facilities at NYU. It was launched to help meet the world\u2019s demand for researchers and professionals skilled in developing and utilizing automated methods of analyzing data. The initiative is especially focused on harnessing the potential power of big data to transform areas ranging from healthcare to business to government. Data science overlaps traditionally strong disciplines at NYU such as mathematics, statistics and computer science. It also stands to impact disciplines in which NYU\u2019s schools and departments are actively engaged, such as economics, law and sociology.

The Future         Where will the data revolution take us?                                                                                                                                                     Turning data into insight.   Our networked world is generating a deluge of data that no human, or group of humans, can process fast enough. This data deluge has the potential to transform the way business, government, science and healthcare are carried out. The emerging discipline of data science holds the key to unlocking that potential. It uses automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and extract knowledge from them. Data science combines aspects of computer science, applied mathematics and statistics.        Big data monitors 12 terabytes of tweets each day to improve product sentiment analysis.     \u201cData science will also revolutionize medicine, education, and other areas that are slated to become \u2018evidence-based.\u2019\u201d \u2014NYU\u2019s Data Science and Statistics Working Group                                                                                                                                        From healthcare to business to government.   Data science is already being put to use in nearly every sphere of modern life. The transportation industry is using it to better predict flight arrival times. Online retailers are using it to better understand consumer habits. Managers are using it to make decisions based on facts rather than instincts. But data science is in its infancy. As it matures, data science holds the promise of creating drugs customized for individual patients, making government run more efficiently and helping our cities be healthier places to live.        By 2010, 28% of the digital universe required some level of data network security.     \u201cRobust, unbiased data are the first step toward addressing our long-term economic needs and key policy priorities.&#8221; \u2014Peter Orszag, Former Director, White House Office of Management and Budget                                                                                                                                          Acquire &amp; Parse   Sensors, medical devices, the Web and smartphones \u2014 to name just a few sources \u2014 capture structured and unstructured data in massive amounts in real-time, all the time.

Their insights are used in sectors ranging from biology to finance to government.       Interaction   Data scientists excel in presenting complicated findings for experts and non-experts alike. Information visualization, graphic design and human computer interaction all come into play.                                                                                                                                        Where will the data revolution take us?   Data science has already started to revolutionize most areas of intellectual endeavor found at NYU and in the world. We believe this revolution is just beginning. Data science can help us answer not only the great questions and challenges of our time, but also centuries-old questions. Through data science we may improve our understanding of how the brain works, for example. With that understanding we can build intelligent machines capable of advancing life-saving medical research. Data science can help us realize the promises of the digital age.        33% of all data will be stored, or will have passed through the cloud by 2015.     \u201c\u2026Now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data.
