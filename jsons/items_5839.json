A fundamental component of the Department's mission is to provide excellence in teaching across the broad array of academic disciplines at the predoctoral, postdoctoral, and graduate school levels.   Departmental teaching for the DDS curriculum focuses on foundational knowledge and practical application to the practice of dentistry for the following subjects: epidemiology, health promotion, bioethics, biostatistics, skills in assessing the professional literature, and public health issues and policy for the dental practitioner.   Teaching at the Master's level provides a two-year MS program in Clinical Research , as well as contributions to the Global MPH program offered at the university level. The Department also seeks to partner fully with the NYU Global Institute of Public Health as it builds its educational and research programs in global public health. Most recently at the MS level, the Department led the formation of a new, one-year, full-time MS in Evidence-Based Practice degree program.   Moreover, the Department was created and constituted to undertake and achieve major original research and other scholarly activities, and thus to provide national leadership for, and contributions to, the fields of epidemiology and health promotion.                    meet our faculty Read More                    MS in Clinical Research Read More                    JADE Read More                                                                         Curricula Highlights                               The NYU College of Dentistry's DDS curriculum sets the national trend in the teaching of epidemiology and health promotion, with a solid series of foundational didactic and preclinical courses. The four-year curriculum in Skills in Assessing the Professional Literature (SAPL) also sets the national standard for the teaching of EBD. Similarly, the Department's MS in Clinical Research program is a unique offering among US dental schools in that we are the only dental school offering an MS in Clinical Research degree.   The recent addition of the MS in Evidence-Based Practice, a one-year full-time program, is the first established in a dental college in the US. The Department also houses the Oral Health Concentration within NYU's MPH in Global Health program, and offers a joint DDS-MPH degree opportunity. The PhD in Epidemiology program, run in collaboration with Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University, is now in its 21st year of operation.                                                              History of Departmental Research Activity                               The Department has had a major commitment to research and scholarly activities since its inception in June 2000.Over its first 13 years of existence, the Department has received over $55 million in over 20 externally funded grants, most from the NIH, in which Departmental faculty serve as the PI or co-PI of the study. The research portfolio has included:     an NIDCR U54 Oral Health Disparities Center, the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP* Center;   four R01 grants from NIH, including:   a clinical trial on smoking cessation;   a clinical study on the relationship between periodontal disease and pre-term, low birth weight;   a study on the relationship between early childhood malnutrition and the development and diseases of the permanent dentition in Haiti; and   an integrated social and systems science study toward improving oral health equity for older adults;       a major collaborative NIH-grant focused on building a research infrastructure at the University of Puerto Rico's School of Dentistry.     In addition, the Department recently completed four five-year cycles of NIDCR/NIH funding for its NYU Oral Epidemiology T32 NRSA Training Grant, and is now launching a new version of that program, the NYU Global Postdoctoral Oral Epidemiology Training (POETS) program, which will also offer the PhD in epidemiology (again, in collaboration with the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University), but now focused on international applicants. Finally, several Departmental faculty members serve as research mentors for clinical faculty at NYU, both in the College of Dentistry and in the School of Medicine.                                                              Service by Faculty: Community, University, and Extracurricular Programs                               The Departmental faculty involve themselves in a wide variety of community and University activities that vary year-by-year. Departmental faculty run the NYU Spaghetti &amp; Science Society, a monthly student club that meets in an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village to discuss a scientific article over &quot;a plate of pasta and a glass of wine.&quot; In past activities, a faculty member developed and taught a six-week earth sciences module on wind energy versus nuclear energy at the Salk Science School, a NYC magnet science Jr. High School. Another faculty member has served as the program officer for a NYC service to bring geriatric dental services to needy New Yorkers, while another serves on several NYC and New York State health boards.                                                                   Brief History                               The Department of Epidemiology &amp; Health Promotion was created in June 2000. During the first 13 years of its existence, the Department faculty served as PI or co-PI on new grants totaling more than $55M from a range of national and state agencies. The Department currently houses the following graduate degree programs: the PhD in Epidemiology program, established in 2000 jointly with Columbia University's Department of Epidemiology; both the Certificate and the MS in Clinical Research programs (which began in 2002); and the Oral Health Concentration for the Global MPH (which began in 2006).

Here's what our patients are saying:                                I am writing to you to express my complete satisfaction with the level of dental care that I have been receiving from my student dentist, Ms Kavita Patel. She has a most pleasing personality and is very respectful to a 74-year-old.   I feel very comfortable when she is examining and cleaning my teeth; she inspires trust. Her chair-side manner is very reassuring and her handling of dental instruments is very gentle. I appreciate that she keeps in touch with the faculty periodontist, Dr. Kye, and together they keep me abreast of the best plan for my dental health. She updates him whenever necessary. She also has Dr. Kye check her work before ending my appointment.   In my opinion she is already an outstanding dental practitioner. I still have one year left under her care, until she graduates, and will continue to enjoy that special care.

A fundamental component of the Department's mission is to provide excellence in teaching across the broad array of academic disciplines at the predoctoral, postdoctoral, and graduate school levels.   Departmental teaching for the DDS curriculum focuses on foundational knowledge and practical application to the practice of dentistry for the following subjects: epidemiology, health promotion, bioethics, biostatistics, skills in assessing the professional literature, and public health issues and policy for the dental practitioner.   Teaching at the Master's level provides a two-year MS program in Clinical Research , as well as contributions to the Global MPH program offered at the university level. The Department also seeks to partner fully with the NYU Global Institute of Public Health as it builds its educational and research programs in global public health. Most recently at the MS level, the Department led the formation of a new, one-year, full-time MS in Evidence-Based Practice degree program.   Moreover, the Department was created and constituted to undertake and achieve major original research and other scholarly activities, and thus to provide national leadership for, and contributions to, the fields of epidemiology and health promotion.                    meet our faculty Read More                    MS in Clinical Research Read More                    JADE Read More                                                                         Curricula Highlights                               The NYU College of Dentistry's DDS curriculum sets the national trend in the teaching of epidemiology and health promotion, with a solid series of foundational didactic and preclinical courses. The four-year curriculum in Skills in Assessing the Professional Literature (SAPL) also sets the national standard for the teaching of EBD. Similarly, the Department's MS in Clinical Research program is a unique offering among US dental schools in that we are the only dental school offering an MS in Clinical Research degree.   The recent addition of the MS in Evidence-Based Practice, a one-year full-time program, is the first established in a dental college in the US. The Department also houses the Oral Health Concentration within NYU's MPH in Global Health program, and offers a joint DDS-MPH degree opportunity. The PhD in Epidemiology program, run in collaboration with Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University, is now in its 21st year of operation.                                                              History of Departmental Research Activity                               The Department has had a major commitment to research and scholarly activities since its inception in June 2000.Over its first 13 years of existence, the Department has received over $55 million in over 20 externally funded grants, most from the NIH, in which Departmental faculty serve as the PI or co-PI of the study. The research portfolio has included:     an NIDCR U54 Oral Health Disparities Center, the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP* Center;   four R01 grants from NIH, including:   a clinical trial on smoking cessation;   a clinical study on the relationship between periodontal disease and pre-term, low birth weight;   a study on the relationship between early childhood malnutrition and the development and diseases of the permanent dentition in Haiti; and   an integrated social and systems science study toward improving oral health equity for older adults;       a major collaborative NIH-grant focused on building a research infrastructure at the University of Puerto Rico's School of Dentistry.     In addition, the Department recently completed four five-year cycles of NIDCR/NIH funding for its NYU Oral Epidemiology T32 NRSA Training Grant, and is now launching a new version of that program, the NYU Global Postdoctoral Oral Epidemiology Training (POETS) program, which will also offer the PhD in epidemiology (again, in collaboration with the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University), but now focused on international applicants. Finally, several Departmental faculty members serve as research mentors for clinical faculty at NYU, both in the College of Dentistry and in the School of Medicine.                                                              Service by Faculty: Community, University, and Extracurricular Programs                               The Departmental faculty involve themselves in a wide variety of community and University activities that vary year-by-year. Departmental faculty run the NYU Spaghetti &amp; Science Society, a monthly student club that meets in an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village to discuss a scientific article over &quot;a plate of pasta and a glass of wine.&quot; In past activities, a faculty member developed and taught a six-week earth sciences module on wind energy versus nuclear energy at the Salk Science School, a NYC magnet science Jr. High School. Another faculty member has served as the program officer for a NYC service to bring geriatric dental services to needy New Yorkers, while another serves on several NYC and New York State health boards.                                                                   Brief History                               The Department of Epidemiology &amp; Health Promotion was created in June 2000.

Here's what our patients are saying:                                I am writing to you to express my complete satisfaction with the level of dental care that I have been receiving from my student dentist, Ms Kavita Patel. She has a most pleasing personality and is very respectful to a 74-year-old.   I feel very comfortable when she is examining and cleaning my teeth; she inspires trust. Her chair-side manner is very reassuring and her handling of dental instruments is very gentle. I appreciate that she keeps in touch with the faculty periodontist, Dr. Kye, and together they keep me abreast of the best plan for my dental health. She updates him whenever necessary. She also has Dr. Kye check her work before ending my appointment.   In my opinion she is already an outstanding dental practitioner. I still have one year left under her care, until she graduates, and will continue to enjoy that special care.
