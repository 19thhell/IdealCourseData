Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of Europe's most lively and charming cities. It boasts a history that goes back to the Middle Ages; from the 16th century on, it was the seat of a brilliant royal court. This is reflected in the city's rich architecture and abundance of monuments.   Contemporary Madrid is a clean and efficient city of wide boulevards, outstanding museums, monuments, theatres, and libraries. The city's public transportation-metro and buses-is first rate. Madrid is famous for its restaurants as well as its nightlife. The numerous caf\u00e9s are frequented by students, writers, artists, and journalists. Because of its location in the geographical center of the country, Madrid is also an ideal base for exploring the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and beyond through a network of rapid, modern bus and rail transportation. Students who have lived and studied in Madrid often look at that period as one of the most transforming experiences of their lives.           ACADEMICS   NYU Summer in Madrid offers Spanish language courses at all levels, including intensive study, as well as Spanish literature, culture, fine arts, history, and cinema courses in English or Spanish. Courses are taught by NYU Madrid faculty and Spanish university professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Students also enjoy a full range of cultural activities, seminars, and excursions led by experts in history, art, and architecture. Visits include the world-renowned Prado museum, other important museums and monuments, and Old Madrid, the &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; of this historic city. In addition, students' knowledge and understanding of Spain is broadened by excursions to other regions and cities such as Santiago de Compostella, Gij\u00f3n and Toledo.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS      The NYU Madrid academic center is two chalet-style buildings located in the beautiful El Viso neighborhood just a few Metro stops from the city center.     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. The program arranges for students to live in Spanish homes, which is strongly recommended as the best way to encourage the use of Spanish and to immerse oneself in the rhythms of everyday life. Apartments are also available. Students are informed of their homestay families and apartments before arrival in Madrid.           EXCURSIONS   There is a three-day excursion as part of the Summer Program. Option A is Castilla-Leon and the Basque Country (Burgos, Bilbao, and Soria); Option B is Northern Spain: Oviedo and Gijon. Possible day trips include El Escorial, Toledo, and Segovia.           COURSES     Students must register for 8 points. It is strongly suggested that students register for one 4 point language course and one 4 point content course, or for one 8 point intensive language course.

Madrid is famous for its restaurants as well as its nightlife. The numerous caf\u00e9s are frequented by students, writers, artists, and journalists. Because of its location in the geographical center of the country, Madrid is also an ideal base for exploring the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and beyond through a network of rapid, modern bus and rail transportation. Students who have lived and studied in Madrid often look at that period as one of the most transforming experiences of their lives.           ACADEMICS   NYU Summer in Madrid offers Spanish language courses at all levels, including intensive study, as well as Spanish literature, culture, fine arts, history, and cinema courses in English or Spanish. Courses are taught by NYU Madrid faculty and Spanish university professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Students also enjoy a full range of cultural activities, seminars, and excursions led by experts in history, art, and architecture. Visits include the world-renowned Prado museum, other important museums and monuments, and Old Madrid, the &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; of this historic city. In addition, students' knowledge and understanding of Spain is broadened by excursions to other regions and cities such as Santiago de Compostella, Gij\u00f3n and Toledo.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS      The NYU Madrid academic center is two chalet-style buildings located in the beautiful El Viso neighborhood just a few Metro stops from the city center.     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. The program arranges for students to live in Spanish homes, which is strongly recommended as the best way to encourage the use of Spanish and to immerse oneself in the rhythms of everyday life. Apartments are also available. Students are informed of their homestay families and apartments before arrival in Madrid.           EXCURSIONS   There is a three-day excursion as part of the Summer Program. Option A is Castilla-Leon and the Basque Country (Burgos, Bilbao, and Soria); Option B is Northern Spain: Oviedo and Gijon. Possible day trips include El Escorial, Toledo, and Segovia.           COURSES     Students must register for 8 points. It is strongly suggested that students register for one 4 point language course and one 4 point content course, or for one 8 point intensive language course.

Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of Europe's most lively and charming cities. It boasts a history that goes back to the Middle Ages; from the 16th century on, it was the seat of a brilliant royal court. This is reflected in the city's rich architecture and abundance of monuments.   Contemporary Madrid is a clean and efficient city of wide boulevards, outstanding museums, monuments, theatres, and libraries. The city's public transportation-metro and buses-is first rate. Madrid is famous for its restaurants as well as its nightlife. The numerous caf\u00e9s are frequented by students, writers, artists, and journalists. Because of its location in the geographical center of the country, Madrid is also an ideal base for exploring the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and beyond through a network of rapid, modern bus and rail transportation. Students who have lived and studied in Madrid often look at that period as one of the most transforming experiences of their lives.           ACADEMICS   NYU Summer in Madrid offers Spanish language courses at all levels, including intensive study, as well as Spanish literature, culture, fine arts, history, and cinema courses in English or Spanish. Courses are taught by NYU Madrid faculty and Spanish university professors who are recognized experts in their fields. Students also enjoy a full range of cultural activities, seminars, and excursions led by experts in history, art, and architecture. Visits include the world-renowned Prado museum, other important museums and monuments, and Old Madrid, the &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; of this historic city.
