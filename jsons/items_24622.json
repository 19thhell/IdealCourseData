Alex O. Vasilescu, Ph.D.   Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences   New York University     Description of the Technology:     Human Motion Signatures collects data from human motions and recognizes the action performed, an expression cadence, and a human signature. The new technology not only recognizes human motions, such as walking, stair ascending/descending, or dancing, unique to each person but it also records the pattern of movement and predicts where the next movement will be.     Features and Benefits:      Developed a new algorithm that can analyze everyday human motions to separate out distinctive motion signatures.      Recognize specific individuals performing motions not included in our database, using extracted motion signatures associated with these individuals.      Synthesize novel motions that are in accord with extracted motion signatures.     Applications:     This system and process robustly extracts signature parameters from a corpus of motion data spanning multiple subjects performing different types of motions. The extracted signatures are useful in the recognition and synthesis of novel motions for animating articulated characters and for recognizing individual human motion.

Students will develop competent clinical research skills in methodology and data analysis that will be used to solve problems concerning motor control and motor learning in management of patients with physical disabilities. Specifically, students will gain expertise in the analysis and synthesis of human motion, measurement and evaluation of human motion, and research design and implementation by studying both normal and abnormal human motion. The program uses electrogoniometry, electromyography, dynamometry, and cinematography to illustrate the most advanced theories and techniques for measurement and evaluation of human motion. By the end of the program, students will have developed knowledge in:       The identification of the kinematic and kinetic components of normal and abnormal human motion    The interpretation of the biomechanical and neurophysiological factors foundational to the improvement of motor control in individuals with physical disabilities    The formulation and testing of conceptual models concerning the analysis or improvement of motor control in individuals with physical disabilities    The communication of a systemic inquiry that tests as hypothesis concerning the analysis or improvement of human motion       Program Director    Marilyn Moffat, PT, DPT, PhD, DSc (hon), GCS, CSCS, CEEAA, FAPTA Professor of Physical Therapy Phone: 212-998-9400 Email: mm8@nyu.edu    Student Body    This program is open to licensed physical therapists holding at least a baccalaureate degree in physical therapy.

Alex O. Vasilescu, Ph.D.   Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences   New York University     Description of the Technology:     Human Motion Signatures collects data from human motions and recognizes the action performed, an expression cadence, and a human signature. The new technology not only recognizes human motions, such as walking, stair ascending/descending, or dancing, unique to each person but it also records the pattern of movement and predicts where the next movement will be.     Features and Benefits:      Developed a new algorithm that can analyze everyday human motions to separate out distinctive motion signatures.      Recognize specific individuals performing motions not included in our database, using extracted motion signatures associated with these individuals.      Synthesize novel motions that are in accord with extracted motion signatures.     Applications:     This system and process robustly extracts signature parameters from a corpus of motion data spanning multiple subjects performing different types of motions. The extracted signatures are useful in the recognition and synthesis of novel motions for animating articulated characters and for recognizing individual human motion.     Patent Status:     U.S. Patent application pending.
