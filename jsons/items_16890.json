On each rotation site, the intern works closely with attending psychologists and/or psychiatrists who provide clinical and administrative supervision. Interns provide an array of clinical services and participate in various team activities on each rotation site. The majority of the rotation sites are open to all interns, who rank their preferences during the orientation period in July. The exceptions to this are outlined below. Adult Psychology Track : Interns in this track may rank their preferences from any of the rotations offered. At least one of their rotations will be on an inpatient unit. Child and Adolescent Psychology Track: Interns in this track must complete either the Child Inpatient Psychiatry Unit or the Adolescent Inpatient Psychiatry Unit rotation, and a second rotation that is also child or adolescent-focused. They may indicate their preferences for their third rotation from any of the other rotations offered. Forensic Psychology Track: Interns in this track must complete both the assessment-focused rotation and treatment-focused rotation on the Forensic Inpatient Psychiatry Service at Bellevue Hospital Center. They may indicate their preferences for their third rotation from any of the other rotations offered.   Adolescent Inpatient Psychiatry Unit   This unit serves patients between the ages of 12 and 16 years who present with a wide range of diagnoses, including psychotic disturbances, mood disorders, burgeoning personality disorders and behavioral disorders. The intern serves as the primary clinician for 3-5 patients, provides group psychotherapy, and conducts psychological assessments. Interns work as part of a multidisciplinary team that includes psychiatry residents, social workers, activity therapists and nursing staff. There is also frequent contact between interns on this rotation and outside agencies, including schools, treatment centers and the Administration for Children\u2019s Services.   Adult Inpatient Psychiatry Unit   The adult inpatient psychiatry service comprises 220 beds across eight civilian units. It serves patients with primary Axis I diagnoses; among the most common of these are schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (all subtypes), as well as bipolar and major depressive disorders.\u00a0 A considerable number of patients also carry Axis II diagnoses and many have co-morbid substance abuse problems.\u00a0 Axis IV issues, including housing, immigration status, and family difficulties, also play a key role in patients\u2019 presentations while on the service and in their discharge planning.\u00a0   Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture (PSOT)   This program provides comprehensive medical and mental health care to survivors of war and war trauma. Clients come from over 60 different countries, and the PSOT is committed to providing treatment that is both culturally relevant and appropriate. Interns on this rotation conduct intake interviews with potential new clients, provide individual and group psychotherapy, address crisis intervention needs, and participate in the forensic evaluation of asylum cases. Supervision is conducted according to an array of theoretical orientations including psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral and family systems.   Chemical Dependency Outpatient Program (CDOP)   The primary mission of Bellevue\u2019s Chemical Dependency Outpatient Program (CDOP) is to serve individuals experiencing substance use disorders.\u00a0 Many of our clients, however, also experience co-occurring Axis I and/or Axis II disorders.\u00a0 To effectively aid our clients in reaching their treatment goals, our team provides an array of services, including initial intake assessments, individual and group psychotherapy, psychological assessment, psychiatric services, social work services, support in pursuing medical care, and, as indicated, referrals to and coordination of services with outside agencies and programs. The rotation will provide abundant opportunities to expand and enhance your clinical skills with a particular focus on increasing/developing: knowledge of different classes of substances; proficiency in conceptualizing cases that involve co-occurring disorders; and the ability to design and implement evidence-based treatment plans for this population.\u00a0 In addition, there will be numerous opportunities to collaborate with colleagues from other disciplines and to test any assumptions that you might have about working with this community of clients.   Child and Adolescent Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (C-CPEP)   The Child and Adolescent Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program comprises comprehensive psychiatric services including triage, psychiatric evaluation and extended observation in the Child CPEP Emergency Room and Interim Crisis Clinic. In the Child CPEP Emergency Room, the psychology intern serves as a primary clinician on a multidisciplinary team. The intern has primary responsibility for the patient\u2019s care including the diagnostic evaluation, mental status exam, and formulating an appropriate disposition plan. In the Interim Crisis Clinic, the intern also serves as primary clinician for short-term crisis intervention services in an outpatient setting while the patient is awaiting community outpatient follow-up.   Child and Adolescent Day Treatment Program   The Adolescent Day Treatment Program (ADTP) is an intensive, non-residential therapeutic program that provides a safe, supportive, patient-centered environment for children and adolescents aged 6-18 who have been diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Areas of focus are both clinical (e.g. the stabilization of behavioral problems, the development of age-appropriate coping and social skills) as well as academic (e.g. incorporating direct school observation and collaboration with both family members and Bellevue\u2019s on-site school staff). Psychology interns work as part of a multidisciplinary team and provide services including evaluation, treatment planning, individual, group and family therapy as well as skills-building and appropriate disposition planning and referral.   Child Inpatient Psychiatry Unit   This unit treats children between the ages of 4 and 11 years, providing psychiatric evaluation, psychological assessment and treatment services related to developmental and psychiatric disorders. This unit also has an autistic classroom for children in this age range. Interns on this rotation conduct assessments, provide psychotherapy and serve as the primary clinician for a small number of patients. There are also frequent opportunities for school consultation as well as interaction with family members.   Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP)   The CPEP is the gateway into the inpatient psychiatric services at Bellevue Hospital Center, evaluating over 700 patients each month. CPEP utilizes a prevention-oriented service model, designed to increase the variety of services available to the community that includes a Mobile Crisis Outreach Team, a 72-hour Interim Crisis Unit and crisis residence services. Interns on this rotation are responsible for conducting diagnostic evaluations, performing mental status examinations and formulating appropriate disposition plans. This rotation provides experience in rapid, in-depth psychiatric assessment, differential diagnosis, crisis management and psychopharmacology.   Forensic Assessment Rotation   On this rotation, required of interns in the Forensic Psychology Track, the intern spends time at both the Inpatient Forensic Psychiatry Service at Bellevue Hospital as well as the Bronx Forensic Psychiatry Court Clinic. The assessments conducted on the Forensic Psychiatry Service are typically used for the purposes of treatment planning, discharge planning, pre-sentencing evaluation or to aid in the assessment of competency to stand trial. At the Court Clinic, assessments incorporate interview and collateral data for purposes including the placement of offenders in jail diversion programs, assessment of clinical issues such as substance abuse or domestic violence, and for the purpose of gaining insight into adolescent offenders waived into adult criminal court for violent crimes.   Forensic Treatment Rotation   This rotation, required of interns in the Forensic Psychiatry Track, is housed on the Inpatient Forensic Psychiatry Service at Bellevue Hospital, which is a 60-bed service that provides acute psychiatric care to individuals who have been charged with a criminal act. Patients on this unit may be pre-arraignment, awaiting trial or post-conviction. Interns on this rotation work as part of a multi-disciplinary team comprised of a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, activity therapist and medical student. The intern conducts intake interviews and provides both individual and group psychotherapy services, and also serves as the primary therapist for a small number of cases. Interns on this rotation also have the opportunity to observe evaluations of competency to stand trial.   Inpatient Rehabilitation Medicine   This unit provides comprehensive care to individuals who present with an array of conditions including spinal cord injuries, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), dementia, traumatic orthopedic fractures and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Interns on this rotation conduct focused neuropsychological assessments and provide short-term psychotherapeutic treatment. Pre-morbid psychopathology, if present, is also assessed and treated as it impacts recovery and rehabilitation. This rotation integrates the intern into a multidisciplinary treatment team which is comprised of physicians, physical and occupational therapists, speech pathologists, art therapists, social workers and psychiatrists.   Neuropsychology Consultation Service   Interns on this rotation gain experience in providing neuropsychological assessment to address a wide array of referral questions. Interns will work with both psychiatric and non-psychiatric inpatients and outpatients. Particular focus is placed on the integration of both normative and qualitative interpretation of standard neuropsychological instruments and clinical data in order to create an effective report. This rotation offers an opportunity to experience the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration to provide the highest level of patient care as it relates to neuropsychological evaluation. Depending on an Intern\u2019s schedule, there may be opportunities to participate in a weekly multi-site case conference and a weekly seminar which includes, for example, journal club, didactics, case presentations, and a focus on professional development.   Psychiatry Walk-In Clinic   The Bellevue Hospital Center Psychiatry Walk-In Clinic is designed to provide comprehensive assessment for admission to the Bellevue Hospital Center Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic, crisis intervention, and linkage to other psychiatry services. The clinic is the gateway to most of the ambulatory services and serves a wide population, including the homeless. Patients who present to the clinic go through a three step evaluation; initial evaluation, laboratory work and medical evaluation. If patient presents as high risk, he or she might be escorted to CPEP. If a patient needs to be connected to outside treatment facilities, linkage is provided. Patients present to the psychiatry walk-in clinic in various stages of psychiatric stability. Mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychosis, personality disorders, substance abuse, major life changes, psychosocial difficulties, unemployment and criminality are common.   \u00a0   \u00a0                                                                                                    NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]}]
