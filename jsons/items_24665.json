Reasonable Accommodations are adjustments to policy, practice, and programs that \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for students with disabilities and provide equal access to NYU\u2018s programs and activities. Accommodation plans and other related services are individualized based on each student\u2019s disability-related needs, disability documentation and NYU program requirements and are therefore determined on a case by case basis. Each student who registers with CSD works with a Disability Specialist to develop a reasonable accommodation plan.   Accommodations include, but are not limited to:     Testing accommodations   Note-takers   Use of a computer for exams   Materials in alternate format   Provision of sign language interpreters     Reasonable accommodations do not negate requirements for successful completion of a program, course, or service or adherence to acceptable standards of behavior. It is important to note that some accommodations are not appropriate in all courses.      How to Register with CSD   Students in higher education who wish to receive accommodations must self disclose by registering their disability with CSD. The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) has established the following process for registration with the office:     Complete an Application for Services form.   Gather and submit current documentation of your disability. To register a learning disability or ADD/ADHD, you must submit a current psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation. If you have a learning disability or ADHD and you do not have a current evaluation and feel unable to secure one, please e-mail mosescsd@nyu.edu and ask for a documentation consultation with a CSD Disability Specialist. For all other disability types, you may submit the CSD Certification of Disability form completed by a qualified health professional/clinician. Please refer to our Disability Documentation Guidelines and choose the one specific to your disability to give to your clinician to use as a guide for completing the Certification of Disability form or psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation.   Submit a signed Authorization for Release of Information form so CSD has your permission to contact your clinician if necessary.   After you have submitted the Application for Services , current disability documentation, and a signed Authorization for Release of Information form, your request for accommodations will be reviewed by a CSD Disability Specialist. You will then be contacted to schedule a meeting to discuss one of the following:     1. Your approved accommodations and how to use the services provided by CSD;  2. The need for additional documentation of your disability;  3. Why you have not been approved for accommodations through CSD.       **Please note that all CSD forms are also available at the Moses Center at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.

Reasonable Accommodations are adjustments to policy, practice, and programs that \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for students with disabilities and provide equal access to NYU\u2018s programs and activities. Accommodation plans and other related services are individualized based on each student\u2019s disability-related needs, disability documentation and NYU program requirements and are therefore determined on a case by case basis. Each student who registers with CSD works with a Disability Specialist to develop a reasonable accommodation plan.   Accommodations include, but are not limited to:     Testing accommodations   Note-takers   Use of a computer for exams   Materials in alternate format   Provision of sign language interpreters     Reasonable accommodations do not negate requirements for successful completion of a program, course, or service or adherence to acceptable standards of behavior. It is important to note that some accommodations are not appropriate in all courses.      How to Register with CSD   Students in higher education who wish to receive accommodations must self disclose by registering their disability with CSD. The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) has established the following process for registration with the office:     Complete an Application for Services form.   Gather and submit current documentation of your disability. To register a learning disability or ADD/ADHD, you must submit a current psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation. If you have a learning disability or ADHD and you do not have a current evaluation and feel unable to secure one, please e-mail mosescsd@nyu.edu and ask for a documentation consultation with a CSD Disability Specialist. For all other disability types, you may submit the CSD Certification of Disability form completed by a qualified health professional/clinician. Please refer to our Disability Documentation Guidelines and choose the one specific to your disability to give to your clinician to use as a guide for completing the Certification of Disability form or psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation.   Submit a signed Authorization for Release of Information form so CSD has your permission to contact your clinician if necessary.   After you have submitted the Application for Services , current disability documentation, and a signed Authorization for Release of Information form, your request for accommodations will be reviewed by a CSD Disability Specialist. You will then be contacted to schedule a meeting to discuss one of the following:     1. Your approved accommodations and how to use the services provided by CSD;  2. The need for additional documentation of your disability;  3. Why you have not been approved for accommodations through CSD.       **Please note that all CSD forms are also available at the Moses Center at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.

Reasonable Accommodations are adjustments to policy, practice, and programs that \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for students with disabilities and provide equal access to NYU\u2018s programs and activities. Accommodation plans and other related services are individualized based on each student\u2019s disability-related needs, disability documentation and NYU program requirements and are therefore determined on a case by case basis. Each student who registers with CSD works with a Disability Specialist to develop a reasonable accommodation plan.   Accommodations include, but are not limited to:     Testing accommodations   Note-takers   Use of a computer for exams   Materials in alternate format   Provision of sign language interpreters     Reasonable accommodations do not negate requirements for successful completion of a program, course, or service or adherence to acceptable standards of behavior. It is important to note that some accommodations are not appropriate in all courses.      How to Register with CSD   Students in higher education who wish to receive accommodations must self disclose by registering their disability with CSD. The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) has established the following process for registration with the office:     Complete an Application for Services form.   Gather and submit current documentation of your disability. To register a learning disability or ADD/ADHD, you must submit a current psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation. If you have a learning disability or ADHD and you do not have a current evaluation and feel unable to secure one, please e-mail mosescsd@nyu.edu and ask for a documentation consultation with a CSD Disability Specialist. For all other disability types, you may submit the CSD Certification of Disability form completed by a qualified health professional/clinician. Please refer to our Disability Documentation Guidelines and choose the one specific to your disability to give to your clinician to use as a guide for completing the Certification of Disability form or psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation.   Submit a signed Authorization for Release of Information form so CSD has your permission to contact your clinician if necessary.   After you have submitted the Application for Services , current disability documentation, and a signed Authorization for Release of Information form, your request for accommodations will be reviewed by a CSD Disability Specialist. You will then be contacted to schedule a meeting to discuss one of the following:     1. Your approved accommodations and how to use the services provided by CSD;  2. The need for additional documentation of your disability;  3. Why you have not been approved for accommodations through CSD.       **Please note that all CSD forms are also available at the Moses Center at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.

Accommodation plans and other related services are individualized based on each student\u2019s disability-related needs, disability documentation and NYU program requirements and are therefore determined on a case by case basis. Each student who registers with CSD works with a Disability Specialist to develop a reasonable accommodation plan.   Accommodations include, but are not limited to:     Testing accommodations   Note-takers   Use of a computer for exams   Materials in alternate format   Provision of sign language interpreters     Reasonable accommodations do not negate requirements for successful completion of a program, course, or service or adherence to acceptable standards of behavior. It is important to note that some accommodations are not appropriate in all courses.      How to Register with CSD   Students in higher education who wish to receive accommodations must self disclose by registering their disability with CSD. The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) has established the following process for registration with the office:     Complete an Application for Services form.   Gather and submit current documentation of your disability. To register a learning disability or ADD/ADHD, you must submit a current psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation. If you have a learning disability or ADHD and you do not have a current evaluation and feel unable to secure one, please e-mail mosescsd@nyu.edu and ask for a documentation consultation with a CSD Disability Specialist. For all other disability types, you may submit the CSD Certification of Disability form completed by a qualified health professional/clinician. Please refer to our Disability Documentation Guidelines and choose the one specific to your disability to give to your clinician to use as a guide for completing the Certification of Disability form or psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation.   Submit a signed Authorization for Release of Information form so CSD has your permission to contact your clinician if necessary.   After you have submitted the Application for Services , current disability documentation, and a signed Authorization for Release of Information form, your request for accommodations will be reviewed by a CSD Disability Specialist. You will then be contacted to schedule a meeting to discuss one of the following:     1. Your approved accommodations and how to use the services provided by CSD;  2. The need for additional documentation of your disability;  3. Why you have not been approved for accommodations through CSD.       **Please note that all CSD forms are also available at the Moses Center at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.
