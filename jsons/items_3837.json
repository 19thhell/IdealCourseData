(Fall 2009, Fall 2008)   Dr. Aliferis and Dr. Statnikov gave this tutorial at the Annual AMIA Conference in 2008 and 2009. The contents of this tutorial are shown below.   Authors: Alexander Statnikov, Douglas Hardin, Isabelle Guyon, Constantin Aliferis. Materials about SVM Clustering were contributed by Nikita Lytkin.   Abstract: This half-day tutorial will introduce support vector machines (SVMs) and their applications in biomedicine. SVMs are among the most important recent developments of machine learning and pattern recognition and have extensive applications in biomedicine and other fields. Unlike other approaches, these techniques are robust in data analysis with high variable-to-sample ratios and large number of irrelevant variables, they can learn efficiently very complex functions, and they employ powerful regularization principles to avoid overfitting.   A common obstacle in understanding and using SVMs is that they are mathematically challenging especially for biomedical researchers lacking extensive technical backgrounds. The tutorial is designed to enable all interested researchers grasp SVM fundamentals regardless of prior mathematical training. First, we will introduce basic principles behind SVMs in an intuitive manner. Then we will describe SVM-based algorithms for classification, regression, clustering and novelty detection, variable selection and dimensionality reduction. These algorithms are widely used and/or gaining popularity in biomedical applications. Throughout the tutorial we will provide case studies for each class of methods and give pointers to software implementations and additional literature. The knowledge gained in this tutorial will allow researchers to break the barriers of classical statistics and older pattern recognition and be able to conduct complex and high-dimensional analyses easily and efficiently.

(Fall 2009, Fall 2008)   Dr. Aliferis and Dr. Statnikov gave this tutorial at the Annual AMIA Conference in 2008 and 2009. The contents of this tutorial are shown below.   Authors: Alexander Statnikov, Douglas Hardin, Isabelle Guyon, Constantin Aliferis. Materials about SVM Clustering were contributed by Nikita Lytkin.   Abstract: This half-day tutorial will introduce support vector machines (SVMs) and their applications in biomedicine. SVMs are among the most important recent developments of machine learning and pattern recognition and have extensive applications in biomedicine and other fields. Unlike other approaches, these techniques are robust in data analysis with high variable-to-sample ratios and large number of irrelevant variables, they can learn efficiently very complex functions, and they employ powerful regularization principles to avoid overfitting.   A common obstacle in understanding and using SVMs is that they are mathematically challenging especially for biomedical researchers lacking extensive technical backgrounds. The tutorial is designed to enable all interested researchers grasp SVM fundamentals regardless of prior mathematical training. First, we will introduce basic principles behind SVMs in an intuitive manner. Then we will describe SVM-based algorithms for classification, regression, clustering and novelty detection, variable selection and dimensionality reduction. These algorithms are widely used and/or gaining popularity in biomedical applications. Throughout the tutorial we will provide case studies for each class of methods and give pointers to software implementations and additional literature. The knowledge gained in this tutorial will allow researchers to break the barriers of classical statistics and older pattern recognition and be able to conduct complex and high-dimensional analyses easily and efficiently.

(Fall 2009, Fall 2008)   Dr. Aliferis and Dr. Statnikov gave this tutorial at the Annual AMIA Conference in 2008 and 2009. The contents of this tutorial are shown below.   Authors: Alexander Statnikov, Douglas Hardin, Isabelle Guyon, Constantin Aliferis. Materials about SVM Clustering were contributed by Nikita Lytkin.   Abstract: This half-day tutorial will introduce support vector machines (SVMs) and their applications in biomedicine. SVMs are among the most important recent developments of machine learning and pattern recognition and have extensive applications in biomedicine and other fields. Unlike other approaches, these techniques are robust in data analysis with high variable-to-sample ratios and large number of irrelevant variables, they can learn efficiently very complex functions, and they employ powerful regularization principles to avoid overfitting.   A common obstacle in understanding and using SVMs is that they are mathematically challenging especially for biomedical researchers lacking extensive technical backgrounds. The tutorial is designed to enable all interested researchers grasp SVM fundamentals regardless of prior mathematical training. First, we will introduce basic principles behind SVMs in an intuitive manner. Then we will describe SVM-based algorithms for classification, regression, clustering and novelty detection, variable selection and dimensionality reduction. These algorithms are widely used and/or gaining popularity in biomedical applications. Throughout the tutorial we will provide case studies for each class of methods and give pointers to software implementations and additional literature. The knowledge gained in this tutorial will allow researchers to break the barriers of classical statistics and older pattern recognition and be able to conduct complex and high-dimensional analyses easily and efficiently.
