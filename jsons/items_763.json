This program of courses relies on a higher level of abstraction and emphasizes the techniques of economic analysis rather than the study of specific economic problems or institutions. It is well-suited for students who intend to pursue a professional career in economics, are considering graduate study in economics, or those pursuing careers or higher degrees in highly quantitative fields such as finance.

Various issues of privatization (such as the roles of ownership and competition in stimulating efficiency, the implications of separation of ownership from management in distinguishing between private and public enterprises, conditions for successful divestiture programs, privatization's employment impact, and contracting out of government services) are discussed both in principle and via examples from industrial, transitional, and less-developed economies.    Topics in Economic Analysis I (P)   ECON-UA 290 Prerequisite: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2). Offered every year. 4 points.   A mid-level undergraduate elective course offered to encourage department or visiting faculty who wish to give courses in fields that are not in the permanent course offerings. The exact topic of this course is announced before registration each year. Such \"topics courses\" are not given regularly, and a specific topic presented in any one semester is unlikely to be repeated. Students are allowed to count only one such topics course for the major.    Politics and Finance: Honors Seminar (P)   ECON-UA 296 Identical to POL-UA 396. Prerequisites: Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300), 3.5 GPA, and permission of the Department of Politics. Offered every year. 4 points.

Designed to familiarize students with a modern approach to industrial organization economics. The modern approach relies extensively on the use of game-theoretic tools to model strategic market behavior and the use of econometric methods for testing hypotheses regarding firm conduct and market performance. In particular, the course analyzes profit-maximizing business strategies of firms with market power, as well as strategic interactions among firms in various types of imperfectly competitive markets. The course addresses both static modes of competition as well as dynamic competition in research and development and product design. The course also examines the scope of effective public policies designed to improve market performance. Throughout the course, mathematical-based models are used to develop the relevant concepts and test the pertinent theories of firm behavior.

Environmental issues include policies to reduce pollution. Substantial attention is paid to global warming caused by consumption of fossil fuels.    Ownership and Corporate Control in Advanced and Transition Economies (P, T)   ECON-UA 340 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Discusses the conceptual foundations and empirical evidence concerning the effects of private ownership on corporate performance. The corporate control mechanisms in the United States, Germany, Japan, and the emerging market economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the role of capital markets (takeovers and other shareholder control devices), banks and other financial institutions, and various corporate institutions (such as boards of directors and meetings of shareholders) in facilitating or hindering corporate control and the efficient allocation of resources.    Behavioral Economics (P)   ECON-UA 342 Prerequisites: Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380) and Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212); or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces students to the field of behavioral economics, which seeks to insert more behavioral realism into economic theory. Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, prospect theory, mental accounting, other-regarding preferences, and hyperbolic discounting. We usually approach a topic by examining evidence of some departure from the assumptions made in the canonical economic model. We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?    Labor Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 351 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every semester. 4 points.

Experimental Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 360 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.    Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experiments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.

Transferring between economics areas can be complex, especially when switching from business economics to the economic theory. You are urged to make this decision early on in their Stern careers.  The list of courses below is divided into three sections:(I) economic theory major courses (anchor to area indicated below), and (II) economics elective courses (anchor to area indicated below). Students in either economics area can choose electives from any list.    Courses listed with a (B) designation indicate that they will count only toward the business economics area. Courses listed with a (T) designation indicate that the course will count only toward the economics theory area. Courses with the notation (B, T) count toward either area.

Designed to familiarize students with a modern approach to industrial organization economics. The modern approach relies extensively on the use of game-theoretic tools to model strategic market behavior and the use of econometric methods for testing hypotheses regarding firm conduct and market performance. In particular, the course analyzes profit-maximizing business strategies of firms with market power, as well as strategic interactions among firms in various types of imperfectly competitive markets. The course addresses both static modes of competition as well as dynamic competition in research and development and product design. The course also examines the scope of effective public policies designed to improve market performance. Throughout the course, mathematical-based models are used to develop the relevant concepts and test the pertinent theories of firm behavior.

Environmental issues include policies to reduce pollution. Substantial attention is paid to global warming caused by consumption of fossil fuels.    Ownership and Corporate Control in Advanced and Transition Economies (P, T)   ECON-UA 340 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Discusses the conceptual foundations and empirical evidence concerning the effects of private ownership on corporate performance. The corporate control mechanisms in the United States, Germany, Japan, and the emerging market economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the role of capital markets (takeovers and other shareholder control devices), banks and other financial institutions, and various corporate institutions (such as boards of directors and meetings of shareholders) in facilitating or hindering corporate control and the efficient allocation of resources.    Behavioral Economics (P)   ECON-UA 342 Prerequisites: Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380) and Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212); or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces students to the field of behavioral economics, which seeks to insert more behavioral realism into economic theory. Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, prospect theory, mental accounting, other-regarding preferences, and hyperbolic discounting. We usually approach a topic by examining evidence of some departure from the assumptions made in the canonical economic model. We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?    Labor Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 351 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every semester. 4 points.   Analyzes the functioning of the labor market in both theoretical and statistical terms. Examines the determinants of wage and employment levels in perfect and imperfect labor markets, including the concept of education and training as human capital. Models of labor market dynamics are also examined, including those of job search and matching. The role of public policy in the functioning of labor markets is highlighted throughout.    Public Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 353 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every semester. 4 points.   In alternate years, stresses policy implications and the development of theory. Analysis of government economic policies and behavior. Normative and positive economics; the fundamental welfare theorems. What goods should the government provide (public goods)? When should the government tax private behavior (externalities)? Income redistribution and the welfare program. Who pays the tax (tax incidence)? The role of debt policy. On what should taxes be levied (optimal taxation)?    Experimental Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 360 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.    Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experiments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.    Elements of Financial Economics (T)   ECON-UA 363 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Restriction: open to students from the Stern School of Business only if FINC-UB 43 has not been taken. Offered every year. 4 points.   Provides theoretical tools for understanding the operation and economic role of asset markets in the financial system. Develops the theory of decision making under uncertainty and techniques for portfolio choice and efficient risk sharing. Develops static and dynamic models of asset markets with applications to efficiency, arbitrage pricing, and the use and pricing of derivative securities.    Advanced Micro Theory (T)   ECON-UA 365 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every other year. 4 points.   Designed to introduce students to some of the main model-building techniques that have been developed by microeconomists. Intended for advanced undergraduates who have taken the necessary preparatory courses in economics and mathematics. Three basic topics are covered. The first topic is the static theory of consumer behavior both in a certain world and in an uncertain world. The second topic is the theory of general equilibrium. The third topic is the theory of dynamic optimization. In addition to the coverage of the economics, the advanced mathematical techniques that are needed to understand the material are reviewed.    Advanced Macroeconomics and Finance (T)   ECON-UA 367 Prerequisites: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11), Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points.   Studies dynamic theories of equilibrium with optimizing agents who face risky returns and uncertain government policies that influence their decisions. We study inflations and hyperinflations; theories of pricing bonds and equity and how well they work empirically; Social Security reform; causes and cures of financial panics; theories of optimal monetary and fiscal policy; and search theory and other applications of dynamic programming.    Financial Economics (P)   ECON-UA 368 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Restriction: not open to students from the Stern School of Business. Offered every year. 4 points.   Provides theoretical and practical tools for understanding the operation of financial markets, the meaning of risk, and its relation to financial return. Also develops concepts of systematic versus idiosyncratic risk, market efficiency, the equilibrium determination of interest rates both in the overnight, interbank lending market and in the market for corporate debt, term and default premia in the bond market, and average excess stock returns in the equity market.
