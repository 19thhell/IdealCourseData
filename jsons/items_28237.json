Next year's Geometry Festival will be held at Princeton; more infomation to come.    Update (2015-04-24): If you would like to attend the dinner, please register by Wednesday, April 29th at noon. There will be a limited number of dinner tickets for people who register after Wednesday on a first-come, first-served basis.   DATES, TIMES, AND LOCATION    The 30th Annual Geometry Festival will be held at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences from Friday, May 1, to Sunday, May 3, 2015. All lectures will be in Warren Weaver Hall ( Directions ).   Everyone is invited to the Geometry Festival, and graduate students are especially encouraged to attend.    REGISTRATION   A list of registered participants can be found here    Schedule  All talks are in Warren Weaver Hall, room 109.   Show/hide all abstracts     Friday   2:30-4:30 Registration -- Warren Weaver, lobby   4:30-5:30 G\u00e1bor Sz\u00e9kelyhidi (Notre Dame)   Kahler-Einstein metrics along the smooth continuity method    We will discuss an equivariant version of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, strengthening the result of Chen-Donaldson-Sun. This potentially gives new examples of Kahler-Einstein manifolds, and it can also be applied to the existence problem for Kahler-Ricci solitons. It is joint work with Ved Datar.   5:30-7:30 Reception -- WW, 13th floor      Saturday   8:30-9:30 Registration and breakfast -- Warren Weaver, lobby   9:30-10:30 Blaine Lawson (Stony Brook)   Potential theory for nonlinear PDE's    There is an interesting potential theory associated to each degenerate elliptic, fully nonlinear equation of the form \\(f(D^2u) = 0\\). For example, for the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, it is the classical pluripotential theory, and for the real Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation,  it is the theory of convex functions. I will explain how these theories are  defined in general. Fundamental to the analysis is a new invariant of such equations, called the Riesz characteristic , which governs asymptotic behavior and singular structures. The notions of tangents to subsolutions and densities will be introduced. Results concerning the existence, uniqueness and strong uniqueness of tangents, monotonicity phenomena, the structure of sets of high density points, and the regularity of subsolutions for certain Riesz characteristics, will be presented.   I will also discuss solutions to the Dirichlet Problem with Prescribed Asymptotic  Singularities in the interior of the domain. In particular this constructs Green's functions and multi-pole Green's functions for these nonlinear equations.  It also sharpens the results concerning points of high density.   Interesting examples include the real, complex and quaternionic Hessian equations, the \\(p\\)-convexity equation, and equations from calibrated geometry.   In particular, this establishes a potential theory on calibrated manifolds.    11:00-12:00 John Pardon (Stanford)   Existence of Lefschetz fibrations on Stein/Weinstein domains    I will describe joint work with E. Giroux in which we show that  every Weinstein domain admits a Lefschetz fibration over the disk  (that is, a singular fibration with Weinstein fibers and Morse  singularities). We also prove an analogous result for Stein  domains in the complex analytic setting. The main tool used to  prove these results is Donaldson's quantitative  transversality.   12:00-2:00 Lunch -- on your own   2:00-3:00 Raanan Schul (Stony Brook)   Qualitative and quantitative rectifiability    We will discuss quantitative and qualitative notions of rectifiability and show how they relate. We will compare rectifiability with respect to Hausdorff measure vs. rectifiability of a generic measure and see how the latter is a place where quantitative and qualitative play well together. Among other things, we will mention an example constructed with Garnett and Killip; work with Badger; and ongoing work with Lerman and Jones.    3:00-4:30 Coffee break -- WW, lobby   4:30-5:30 Ursula Hamenst\u00e4dt (Bonn)   A Gromov/Thurston rigidity theorem for hyperbolic groups   The celebrated Gromov/Thurston rigidity theorem for closed  hyperbolic manifolds can be stated as follows. Let \\(M,N\\) be closed hyperbolic  manifolds of the same dimension \\(n\\geq 2\\)  and let \\(f:M\\to N\\) be a map of degree one. If  \\(\\operatorname{vol}(M)=\\operatorname{vol}(N)\\) then \\(M,N\\) have isomorphic fundamental groups,  (and if \\(n\\geq 3\\) then \\(M,N\\) are in fact isometric).   We extend this result to the case that \\(N\\) is a \\(K(G,1)\\)-space for a torsion  free hyperbolic group with boundary \\(S^{n-1}\\) and where volume is replaced by  simplicial volume. We also discuss some nontrivial examples.   6:00 Banquet -- Kimmel Center      Sunday   8:30-9:30 Breakfast -- Warren Weaver, lobby   9:30-10:30 Tatiana Toro (Washington)   Almost minimizers with free boundary    In recent work with G. David, and ongoing work with G. David and M. Engelstein, we study almost minimizer for functionals which yield a free boundary, as in the work of Alt-Caffarelli and Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman. The almost minimizing property can be understood as the defining characteristic of a minimizer in a problem which explicitly takes noise into account. In this talk we will discuss regularity results for these almost minimizers and explore the structure of the corresponding free boundary. A key ingredient in the study of the 2-phase problem is the existence of almost monotone quantities.   11:00-12:00 Richard Bamler (Berkeley)   There are finitely many surgeries in Perelman's Ricci flow   Although the Ricci flow with surgery has been  used by Perelman to solve the Poincar\u00e9 and Geometrization  Conjectures, some of its basic properties are still unknown. For  example it has been an open question whether the surgeries  eventually stop to occur (i.e. whether there are finitely many  surgeries) and whether the full geometric decomposition of the  underlying manifold is exhibited by the flow as \\(t \\to \\infty\\).    In this talk I will show that the number of surgeries is indeed finite and that the curvature is globally bounded by \\(C t^{-1}\\) for large \\(t\\). Using this curvature bound it is possible to give a more precise picture of the long-time behavior of the flow.

Show/hide all abstracts     Friday   2:30-4:30 Registration -- Warren Weaver, lobby   4:30-5:30 G\u00e1bor Sz\u00e9kelyhidi (Notre Dame)   Kahler-Einstein metrics along the smooth continuity method    We will discuss an equivariant version of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, strengthening the result of Chen-Donaldson-Sun. This potentially gives new examples of Kahler-Einstein manifolds, and it can also be applied to the existence problem for Kahler-Ricci solitons. It is joint work with Ved Datar.   5:30-7:30 Reception -- WW, 13th floor      Saturday   8:30-9:30 Registration and breakfast -- Warren Weaver, lobby   9:30-10:30 Blaine Lawson (Stony Brook)   Potential theory for nonlinear PDE's    There is an interesting potential theory associated to each degenerate elliptic, fully nonlinear equation of the form \\(f(D^2u) = 0\\). For example, for the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, it is the classical pluripotential theory, and for the real Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation,  it is the theory of convex functions. I will explain how these theories are  defined in general. Fundamental to the analysis is a new invariant of such equations, called the Riesz characteristic , which governs asymptotic behavior and singular structures. The notions of tangents to subsolutions and densities will be introduced. Results concerning the existence, uniqueness and strong uniqueness of tangents, monotonicity phenomena, the structure of sets of high density points, and the regularity of subsolutions for certain Riesz characteristics, will be presented.   I will also discuss solutions to the Dirichlet Problem with Prescribed Asymptotic  Singularities in the interior of the domain. In particular this constructs Green's functions and multi-pole Green's functions for these nonlinear equations.  It also sharpens the results concerning points of high density.   Interesting examples include the real, complex and quaternionic Hessian equations, the \\(p\\)-convexity equation, and equations from calibrated geometry.   In particular, this establishes a potential theory on calibrated manifolds.    11:00-12:00 John Pardon (Stanford)   Existence of Lefschetz fibrations on Stein/Weinstein domains    I will describe joint work with E. Giroux in which we show that  every Weinstein domain admits a Lefschetz fibration over the disk  (that is, a singular fibration with Weinstein fibers and Morse  singularities). We also prove an analogous result for Stein  domains in the complex analytic setting. The main tool used to  prove these results is Donaldson's quantitative  transversality.   12:00-2:00 Lunch -- on your own   2:00-3:00 Raanan Schul (Stony Brook)   Qualitative and quantitative rectifiability    We will discuss quantitative and qualitative notions of rectifiability and show how they relate. We will compare rectifiability with respect to Hausdorff measure vs. rectifiability of a generic measure and see how the latter is a place where quantitative and qualitative play well together. Among other things, we will mention an example constructed with Garnett and Killip; work with Badger; and ongoing work with Lerman and Jones.    3:00-4:30 Coffee break -- WW, lobby   4:30-5:30 Ursula Hamenst\u00e4dt (Bonn)   A Gromov/Thurston rigidity theorem for hyperbolic groups   The celebrated Gromov/Thurston rigidity theorem for closed  hyperbolic manifolds can be stated as follows. Let \\(M,N\\) be closed hyperbolic  manifolds of the same dimension \\(n\\geq 2\\)  and let \\(f:M\\to N\\) be a map of degree one. If  \\(\\operatorname{vol}(M)=\\operatorname{vol}(N)\\) then \\(M,N\\) have isomorphic fundamental groups,  (and if \\(n\\geq 3\\) then \\(M,N\\) are in fact isometric).   We extend this result to the case that \\(N\\) is a \\(K(G,1)\\)-space for a torsion  free hyperbolic group with boundary \\(S^{n-1}\\) and where volume is replaced by  simplicial volume. We also discuss some nontrivial examples.   6:00 Banquet -- Kimmel Center      Sunday   8:30-9:30 Breakfast -- Warren Weaver, lobby   9:30-10:30 Tatiana Toro (Washington)   Almost minimizers with free boundary    In recent work with G. David, and ongoing work with G. David and M. Engelstein, we study almost minimizer for functionals which yield a free boundary, as in the work of Alt-Caffarelli and Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman. The almost minimizing property can be understood as the defining characteristic of a minimizer in a problem which explicitly takes noise into account. In this talk we will discuss regularity results for these almost minimizers and explore the structure of the corresponding free boundary. A key ingredient in the study of the 2-phase problem is the existence of almost monotone quantities.   11:00-12:00 Richard Bamler (Berkeley)   There are finitely many surgeries in Perelman's Ricci flow   Although the Ricci flow with surgery has been  used by Perelman to solve the Poincar\u00e9 and Geometrization  Conjectures, some of its basic properties are still unknown. For  example it has been an open question whether the surgeries  eventually stop to occur (i.e. whether there are finitely many  surgeries) and whether the full geometric decomposition of the  underlying manifold is exhibited by the flow as \\(t \\to \\infty\\).    In this talk I will show that the number of surgeries is indeed finite and that the curvature is globally bounded by \\(C t^{-1}\\) for large \\(t\\). Using this curvature bound it is possible to give a more precise picture of the long-time behavior of the flow.
