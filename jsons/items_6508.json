First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays. Plan to take a First-Year Writing Seminar in the fall semester; you will take a First-Year Research Seminar next spring.

Description       What does it mean to heal in the wake of violence? It is often taken for granted that telling one\u2019s story can have a cathartic effect. This presumption has grounded both individual and collective approaches to recovery from trauma in a wide range of contexts over the last fifty years. On this model, narrating one\u2019s experience of victimization\u2014be it in a courtroom, documentary film, or memoir\u2014is presumed to help set one free from psychic pain and from histories of oppression and violence. This course will attempt to deconstruct the trope of narrative as catharsis with respect to specific case studies, including truth commissions, war crimes tribunals, feminist anti-violence campaigns, and postcolonial movements. It will explore this theme using different theoretical, methodological and critical \u201clenses,\u201d such as feminist narrative scholarship, critical race theory, trauma theory, transitional justice, and postcolonial theory. At stake are the presumptions about humans\u2019 ability to heal, their capacity to access the truth, the possibility of recovery following violence, and the power relations at work in different post-traumatic scenes of narration. The course theme will serve as the framework for developing students\u2019 analytic thinking, reading, and writing skills, and provide the basis for class discussions and assignments. In addition to weekly responses, students will be required to write one long and three short analytic papers related to the course theme. Readings may include works by Sigmund Freud, Martin Luther King Jr., Michel Foucault, Frantz Fanon, Shoshana Felman, Desmond Tutu, Veena Das, and Martha Minow.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Description       What does it mean to heal in the wake of violence? It is often taken for granted that telling one\u2019s story can have a cathartic effect. This presumption has grounded both individual and collective approaches to recovery from trauma in a wide range of contexts over the last fifty years. On this model, narrating one\u2019s experience of victimization\u2014be it in a courtroom, documentary film, or memoir\u2014is presumed to help set one free from psychic pain and from histories of oppression and violence. This course will attempt to deconstruct the trope of narrative as catharsis with respect to specific case studies, including truth commissions, war crimes tribunals, feminist anti-violence campaigns, and postcolonial movements. It will explore this theme using different theoretical, methodological and critical \u201clenses,\u201d such as feminist narrative scholarship, critical race theory, trauma theory, transitional justice, and postcolonial theory. At stake are the presumptions about humans\u2019 ability to heal, their capacity to access the truth, the possibility of recovery following violence, and the power relations at work in different post-traumatic scenes of narration. The course theme will serve as the framework for developing students\u2019 analytic thinking, reading, and writing skills, and provide the basis for class discussions and assignments. In addition to weekly responses, students will be required to write one long and three short analytic papers related to the course theme. Readings may include works by Sigmund Freud, Martin Luther King Jr., Michel Foucault, Frantz Fanon, Shoshana Felman, Desmond Tutu, Veena Das, and Martha Minow.
