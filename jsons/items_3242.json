The title is conferred upon outstanding scholars whose work reflects exceptional breadth and some of whose work is interdisciplinary. Because of this interdisciplinary dimension, the title of \u201cUniversity Professor\u201d carries a somewhat different meaning at NYU than similar titles carry at other universities.

The title is conferred upon outstanding scholars whose work reflects exceptional breadth and some of whose work is interdisciplinary. Because of this interdisciplinary dimension, the title of \u201cUniversity Professor\u201d carries a somewhat different meaning at NYU than similar titles carry at other universities.
