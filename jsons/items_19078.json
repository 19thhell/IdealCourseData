In short, we are the premier training  ground for future music moguls.     How We Define \u201cCreative Entrepreneur\u201d A passionate self-starter who draws on his/her innovative  vision and business acumen \u2013 often with unconventional flair \u2013 to launch a  successful, unique enterprise.

Seven Types of Creative Entrepreneurs The Clive Davis Institute recognizes seven main types of creative Entrepreneurs in music: Executive Entrepreneurs, Producer Entrepreneurs, Performer Entrepreneurs, Tech-Preneurs, Songwriter Entrepreneurs, Social Entrepreneurs and Journalist Entrepreneurs. **ENTREPRENEUR WITH AN EXECUTIVE FOCUS ** Do you want to eventually launch and operate a record label, a live music venue, music festival, a retail store, an artist management company, or become involved in A&amp;R, marketing, branding, touring, booking or promotion? If you want to be chiefly involved in the business of creating, marketing, managing, and distributing music beyond producing or performing, you may be what we describe as an aspiring executive entrepreneur.

Examples of renowned social entrepreneurs: Lauren Sullivan and Adam Gardner , founders of Reverb; John Carlin and Leigh Blake , founders of the Red Hot Project; Russell Simmons , founder of Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation; Daniel Glass and Bob Caviano , the founders of Lifebeat; and artists like Bob Geldof , John Legend , Alicia Keys , Bono , Jack Johnson , and Peter Gabriel all leveraged their artistic success to emerge as social entrepreneurs. ** ENTREPRENEUR WITH A TECHNOLOGY FOCUS ** Do you think you have the skills to become a technology visionary who starts and launches a music venture for the Internet, mobile or any other form of new/emergent media?

The Recorded Music B.F.A. undergraduate program is designed to provide professional training for students who aim to succeed as creative entrepreneurs in the music industry. A creative entrepreneur is a driven, passionate individual who starts and runs an innovative business enterprise. Students who enroll in Recorded Music have a wide range of aspirations. Some aspire to become CEOs of record labels. Others aspire to become innovative record producers who helm successful production companies. Some students are performing artists or music critics who want to develop their business acumen so that they might build a successful brand. In every case, our mission is to provide students with the necessary skills - business, creative, intellectual and social - so that they might succeed as leaders in an evolving music industry. We encourage students to develop innovative musical ideas and envision new music business models. We also encourage students to work collaboratively and to cultivate both intellectual rigor and a willingness to experiment artistically.

In September 2003, the Tisch School of the Arts proudly inaugurated the Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music. \"I've felt for many years that serious, career-minded students of recorded music should have their own school, just as film aspirants have had and benefited from for decades. New York is the CENTER of the world's music whether it be rock, hip hop, pop, theatre, classical, or jazz, and the Tisch School is the creative pulse of young people everywhere.
