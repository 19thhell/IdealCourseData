Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Beyond the basics of negotiation lie areas of greater complexity. One such area is the realm of culture. The role of culture can be considered from several perspectives: Cross-cultural (attempting, from one cultural perspective, to understand or describe another); intercultural (the interplay of cultures); and transcultural (aspects of negotiation that are common to all cultures or, in intercultural situations, transcend them.      Culture can be thought of in terms of both the relatively simple, though not unimportant, aspect of etiquette and behavior, and the more complex and profound aspect of consciousness and worldview. In the first half of the course, we will consider:   \u2022 The challenges of doing cultural analysis;   \u2022 A framework of cultural variables that comprise or underlie negotiation styles;   \u2022 Empirical studies about the differences that culture appears to make in the negotiation process;   \u2022 Cultural challenges in management; and   \u2022 The implications of these insights for reflective practitioners.      The second focus of the course is on the theory and practice of inter-group conflict resolution, which often has an important intercultural component, and the role of NGOs in that work. NGOs often can play an important role in peaeemaking processes, though there can be tensions between NGOs and countries that are trying to resolve the conflict at the official diplomatic level. This section of the course will include a consideration of the many challenges of using inter-group processes to reduce tension and the possibility that well-intentioned western intervenors may inadvertently bring counterproductive cultural assumptions to such interventions.      The final session will be devoted primarily to playing and discussing a simulation involving an interethnic crossborder   conflict.
