Our academic center is located in a recently renovated historic building in a central area of Sydney. The facility houses classrooms, a computer lab, library, and administrative offices. A common area doubles as a study lounge and space for social gatherings.   Curriculum and faculty   Students enrolled in courses at NYU Sydney will be able to explore Aboriginal art and culture as the longest continuous civilization on the planet. Courses will introduce Australia's rich history of immigrant communities that formed this continent-sized nation with unique and compelling characteristics. The curriculum offers classes in anthropology, English, environmental studies, history and society, journalism, and communications, among many other courses of study.     Leading professors will be drawn from Sydney and the local region. Faculty-led field trips, which take students beyond the areas visited by casual tourists, are an essential part of the program.   Cultural engagement   NYU Sydney faculty and staff are committed to creating an environment where active learning and exploration are the rule. Courses and projects rooted in the community, field-based research, internship opportunities, as well as chances to travel throughout the city, surrounding neighborhoods and region will give students a thorough experience of local domains, society and culture.
