Sample Courses:  Students should refer to a current class schedule each semester to   determine current course offerings.The list below is representative, not exhaustive.  Introduction to the City I G65.1108 Introduces   the complex nature of the city and the local and global political,   social, and economic forces that shape it. As these forces manifest   themselves differently in different localities, students study various   city types, including the global city, the modern metropolis, and the   informal city. New York City is the main platform for exploration,   revealing as it does the continuities and congruencies in the forms and   processes that characterize contemporary cities. Garbage in   Gotham: The Anthropology of Trash G65.1813 Traces changing   definitions of value and worthlessness through Enlightenment, modern,   and postmodern theory. Considers these through the perspective of trash,   which is read as a reflection of contemporary social mores, time/space   compression, and fragmentations of cultural identity, among other   themes. Uses New York City as a case study. Introduction to the City II G65.2108 Students   learn various approaches for studying the city by transforming a topic   of interest into a researchable question, developing a research design,   and identifying the most appropriate methods for their chosen research   project. An overview of qualitative research methods is provided, both   through the examination of existing studies and the development of the   students\u2019 own projects. Topics   in the City: A Brief History of Urban Consciousness G65.3003 Starting   with Walter Benjamin\u2019s submission of the flaneur as the prototypical   subject of the modern metropolis, theorists have debated the   Eurocentric, hetero-normative, and bourgeois assumptions that underlie   such as framing of urban subjectivity. Indeed, post-structuralism,   feminist geography, queer theory and subaltern studies have staged   valuable interventions into this original thesis of urban consciousness   as submitted by Benjamin. This course is arranged around the central   premise that understanding urban space requires and interrogation of the   particular subjectivities that it produces and a sustained exploration   of the dialectic between subject and city.

From the Interaction Lab \u00a0course, Yi Zhao, Zhener Ma, and Haoyu Wu presented \u201cInterstellar,\u201d a space-themed, interactive game that involves\u00a0throwing play balls at a display of circular light-up targets.   From the Sound &amp; Vision course, sophomore Kevin Pham encouraged passersby to try \u201cThe Syzygy of Dance,\u201d an interactive project that teaches rhythm and dance using Kinect to capture motion and trigger music samples.   Also from Sound &amp; Vision , Zhang Zhan and Ferwa Razzaq\u2019s \u201cLaser Harp,\u201d described as \u201can electronic musical instrument and laser lighting display,\u201d allowed participants to play melodies across a series of red laser beams shining through an eerie fog.   Other projects included Saphya Council and Marjorie Wang\u2019s KTV-based \u201cThe Chain Music Box,\u201d\u00a0 Nicole Chan\u2019s Harry Potter-themed \u201cThe Sorting Hat,\u201d Baaria Chaudhary\u2019s satirical \u201cElevator Pitch\u201d game, and Nicholas Sanchez\u2019s \u201cRFID/NFC\u00a0Education\u201d project presenting\u00a0wearable technology as an identification card.   Shanghai Stories \u00a0students also\u00a0presented numerous projects, including interpretive contrast photography between Ding Ling\u2019s Shanghai, Spring 1930 and Mian Mian\u2019s novel Candy , a gripping visual arts performance from\u00a0Chloe Haddaway and Jos\u00e9 Cabrera\u00a0titled Candy : An Abstract Illusion , and six short student films about Sherlock Holmes in Shanghai.   EAP students were encouraged to \u201csee reality through multiple perspectives\u201d and filled a room with video projects on Cities and Urban Consciousness: Storying Science , through which\u00a0they explored \u201cexaminations of otherness in science and technology\u201d and the \u201cparadoxes of individual Shanghai streets.\u201d Freshman student Zihou Zhao\u2019s short film \"Century Avenue Park\"\u00a0gave detailed landscaping plans in hopes of transforming Shanghai\u2019s Century Avenue into a greener place.   While impossible to capture every student's project, what was captured between the booths, laptops, and excited flurry of conversations was the strong\u00a0student dedication. Creativity, critical thinking, and inner resourcefulness nurtured by a supportive education are key ingredients\u00a0for more innovative creations in the future.
