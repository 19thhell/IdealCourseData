This was followed by a year of study in Bonn, and under the tutelage of Johannes Straub. The next stop was Columbia University, where I completed my graduate studies. My teachers there were Roger Bagnall (my dissertation advisor), Alan Cameron, William Harris, Morton Smith, and William Metcalf, who was then at the American Numismatic Society. The other person, who much influenced my own approach to Roman history, was G\u00e9za Alf\u00f6ldy, who was Professor of Roman History in Heidelberg, where I spent a fair amount of time in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  My first book project, which had been my dissertation, tackled imperial titulature and chronology during the third century AD. This project actually arose, via a circuitous route, from Pliny\u2019s insistence, in his Panegyric , about the importance of the epithet optimus . In any case, one of the chief sources for the chronology of the third century is the Codex Justinianus , with its dated imperial rescripts. My engagement with this fascinating book quickly led to an interest in Roman law, though in particular, the ways in which law was implemented on a quotidian basis. Thus, a second book on the delegation of imperial jurisdiction, and the men, who carried out this function. Engagement with Roman administration and Roman law kept me constantly thinking about the men, who implemented both, and I began especially to wonder about the intersections of the literary interests of these men with their \u201cprofessional\u201d lives. For clearly, both working as a member of the governing elite and writing were of crucial importance to these individuals. That led me to ask, in particular, why the Roman aristocrat seems to have had almost no interest whatsoever in writing about administration. The one apparent exception, Frontinus, who wrote a booklet about the administration of Rome\u2019s water supply, led to a third book project. Throughout all of this, I was repeatedly struck by the obvious effects of Roman social constructs on nearly everything they undertook. A concern with this aspect of the Roman world led to my editing a handbook on Roman social relations. Presently, I have two larger projects in mind. The first, toward which I\u2019ve been collecting ideas and material for quite awhile now, would be a study of Roman abusive behaviors and practices. I have also come to think that we need an in-depth study of the changes in Rome\u2019s legal culture, which came about during the years of Augustus\u2019 rule. I\u2019ve begun to write a bit about that, and am starting to collect materials for such a book.  With respect to teaching, I generally approach classes from one of two angles. First, I like to try to engage my own research in the classroom. Thus, I am presently (fall 2014) teaching a course on Roman law, and in particular, how las was created and implemented. Otherwise, I am often inclined to teach courses on matters, about which I would like to learn. Thus, I last year offered a course on the Augustan period in the provinces. Or, for example, a few years back, I offered a course on Germanicus, and all of the complexities raised by his life and times.
