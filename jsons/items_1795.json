Firstly, the articulation of literature and historiography in a century whose history was particularly shaken -- an issue I am currently revisiting for the publication of the second edition of my Le Pass\u00e9 recompos\u00e9, le roman historique fran\u00e7ais du XIXe si\u00e8cle. Secondly, the inscription of family in literature -- an interest which lead me, in addition, to interrogate how 19th-century thinkers understood an institution in profound mutation between the Old Regime and the Third Republic. Thirdly -- and this is the topic of my next book --, the literary expression of justice, more specifically retributive justice, private and public, in the Romantic period, in its philosophical, ethical as well as judiciary ramifications.

Many of these journals also published political, sociological, and philosophical articles, poetry, essays, literary criticism, as well as theater, art and music reviews. Titles included in this set were selected from &quot;A Chronological List of the Most Important Periodicals in the Symbolist Movement, 1881-99,&quot; compiled by Kenneth Cornell in his book, The Symbolist Movement (New Haven, 1951).       Access: Microfilm is located in the Microforms room on the LL2 of Bobst Library. Film is shelved alphabetically by the name of the journal, with a few exceptions (see below for details). Individual journal titles are listed in BobCat.           L&#39;Art Litt\u00e9raire    Location: microfilm, under title L&#39;Art Litt\u00e9raire       Paris, no. 1-13, Oct. 1892 - Dec. 1893; No. 1-12, 1894.    Founded by Louis Lormel, this magazine includes contributions by Remy    de Gourmont, Mallarm\u00e9, Jarry, Saint-Pol-Roux, Gide and others.    In addition to poetry and articles it contains interesting graphics.            Arte: Revista International    Location: microfilm, under title Arte       Coimbra, Vol. 1 (No. 1-8), Nov. 1895 - June 1896.     See microfilm reel with title: L&#39;art litt\u00e9raire.        This little magazine, founded and edited in Portugal by Eugenio    de Castro and Manuel da Silva Gayo, contains French contributions    by Verlaine, Kahn, Merrill, Saint-Pol-Roux, and Gourmont. It testifies    to the rapid dispersion of French Symbolist themes and forms.                La Basosche    Location: microfilm, under title Basosche       Brussels, Vol. 1-2 (No. 1-16), Nov. 1884 - Apr 1886.     See microfilm reel with title: L&#39;art litt\u00e9raire.        Contains poetry by Fontainas, Merrill, Mikha\u00ebl, and Quillard,    as well as the first of Ren\u00e9 Ghil&#39;s manifestoes.

Le Boulevard; Journal Litt\u00e9raire Illustr\u00e9       Location: microfilm, under title Boulevard       Paris, num\u00e9ro sp\u00e9cimen, Dec. 1, 1861; Vol. 1-2, No. 24,    Jan. 5, 1862 - June 14, 1863.    This is, strictly speaking, a pre-Symbolist periodical. It is included    in the present list because of its publication of Baudelaire, Leconte    de Lisle, and other important precursors of the Symbolist movement.    Its pages contain numberous brilliant caricatures and other graphics    by Daumier, B\u00e9nassit, Bouquet, Pastelot, Regamey, etc. Never    popular with the government, its existence was eventually terminated    by the official censors.            Le Centaure    Location: microfilm, under title Boulevard       Paris, Vol. 1-2, 1896    Founded and edited by Henri Albert in collaboration with Pierre Lou\u00ffs    and others. This brief but elegant periodical contains important poems    and critical essays by R\u00e9gnier, Gide, Val\u00e9ry, Herold,    and Tinan. It also contains some outstanding graphics by Besnard, Rops,    L\u00e9andre, Blanche, and others.            Le Chat Noir (4 reels)    Location: microfilm, under title Chat Noir       Paris, Vol. 1-14 (No. 1-688), 1882-1895    Published weekly out of Rodolphe Salis&#39; Artists&#39; Cafe. It contains poetry    and other items by Verlaine, Rollinat, Morice, Samain, Dubus, Bloy,    Cros, and many others.

Chim\u00e8re; Revue Ind\u00e9pendente d&#39;Insolence Litt\u00e9raire       Location: microfilm, under title Chim\u00e8re       Paris, Vol. 1-2 (No. 1-16), Aug. 1891 - June 1893.    Published by Paul Redonnel out of Montpellier. This little magazine    has the added interest of containing the poetry of writers from the    south of France as well as many contributions by Parisian poets.            La Conque; Anthologie des Plus Jeunes Po\u00e8tes.       Location: microfilm, under title Chim\u00e8re       Paris, No. 1-11, 1891 - 1892    This magazine is particularly noteworthy for the early poems of Lou\u00ffs,    Gide, and, especially, Val\u00e9ry. It also contains contributions    by R\u00e9gnier, L\u00e9on Blum, and the &quot;d\u00e9cadent&quot; Swinburne.            Le Coq Rouge, Revue Litt\u00e9raire    Location: microfilm, under title Chim\u00e8re       Brussels, Vol. 1-3, No. 1, May 1895 - June 1897    Includes contributions from Vi\u00e9l\u00e9-Griffin, Gourmont, Gide,    Gh\u00e9on, Kahn, and Jammes, as well as from Belgian authors. It    was originally founded as a protest against La Jenue Belgique ,    which, in its opinion, had already become reactionary.            Ecrits pour l&#39;Art Litt\u00e9raire et Philosophique       Location: microfilm, under title Chim\u00e8re       Paris, Vol. 1, 1905    Founded and edited by Jean Rog\u00e8re, this little magazine consciously    adopted the same name as Ghil&#39;s 1887-92 journal. Ghil himself contributed    to this latter day Ecrits , along with Pelletier, Nau, Dantinne,    Fayolle, and Randau. The journal is also distinguished for its publication    of translations of Russian Symbolists such as Bal&#39;mont.            Les Entretiens Politiques et Litt\u00e9raires (2 reels)       Location: microfilm, under title Entretiens Politiques   et Litt\u00e9raires       Paris, No. 1-57, Mar. 1, 1890    - Dec. 25, 1893    Founded by Henri de R\u00e9gnier, Paul Adam, Georges Vanor, Bernard    Lazare, and F. Vi\u00e9l\u00e9-Griffin. It also includes contributions    by Quillard, Gide, Mallarm\u00e9, Saint-Pol-Roux. Lecomte, and Malo.    During its brief life, it served as the crossroads for a wide variety    of French literary and political currents, though the Symbolist influence    was strongest.            L&#39;Ermitage (10 reels)    Location: microfilm, under title Ermitage       Paris, Vol. 1-35, Apr. 1890-1906    Along with La Plume , Mercure de France , and La    Revue Blanche , this was one of the four main organs of the Symbolist    movement. Like its peers it devoted space to historical, philosophical,    and sociological topics as well as poetry, literary essays and reviews,    and theatrical and fine arts articles. Founded by Henri Mazel, it was    later edited by Stuart Merrill, Louis le Cardonnel, and Hughes Rebell.    Some other contributors include Tailhade, Vi\u00e9l\u00e9-Griffin,    Maurras, R\u00e9gnier, and Rambosson.            Les Ibis    Location: microfilm, under title Ibis       Paris. No. 1-4, 1894    One of the brief but bright ephemera that were springing up all over    the Symbolist movement. This one was founded by Degron and Klingsor,    and it contains poetry by Vi\u00e9l\u00e9-Griffin, Rett\u00e9,    G\u00e9rardy, R\u00e9gnier, Dierx, Signoret, and others.            La Jeune Revue Litt\u00e9raire    Location: microfilm, under title Jeune Revue Litt\u00e9raire       Brussels, Vol 1, 1880    This was the immediate predecessor of La Jeune Belgique and    includes contributions by Hymans, Gros, Gr\u00e9sil, Berlier, and    Albert Orth.            La Jeune Belgique, Revue d&#39;Art et de Critique (5 reels)       Location: microfilm, under title Jeune Belgique       Brussels, Vol. 1-17, 1881 - Dec 25, 1897.    Superseded La Jeune Revue Litt\u00e9raire . This magazine    functioned as both a positive and a negative force in Symbolism. It    was founded by Max Waller, and after 1889, when Verhaeren became associated    with it, the French Symbolists began appearing regularly in its pages.    But subsequent to 1894 it began conducting as anti-free verse campaign,    thus inspiring the counter-attacks in Le Coq Rouge .            La Jeune France    Location: microfilm, under title Jeune France       Paris, Vol 1-7, May 1, 1878 - Dec 1884.    This periodicals subsequently merged into La Revue Ind\u00e9pendante    but it had a very distinguished life of its own. It was founded by Albert    Allenet and included on editorial board Jules Claretie and Alphones    Daudet. Among its other contributors were Barr\u00e8s, Dierx, Rollinat,    Junes Romain, and Anatole France.            Mercure de France (160 reels + 2 index reels)    Location: microfilm, under title Mercure de France       Paris, Vol. 1-354, 1890 - 1965    Founded by Alfred Vallette to succeed La Pl\u00e9iade , Mercure    de France is far and away the most important periodical of the    Symbolist movement. It outlasted Symbolism as well as a myriad other    subsequent literary, artistic, political, etc., currents. During its    seventy-five year existence Mercure was one of the single most    important French intellectual and artistic journals. Its entire run    is re-published here. The indexes for each year&#39;s issues of the Mercure    have been consolidated in a single film sequence as well as being filmed    in their original place.             Le Parnasse Contemporain; Recueil de Vers Nouveaux    Location: microfilm, under title Parnasse Contemporain       Paris, s\u00e9rie 1-3, 1866 - 1876    Though this journal formally preceded the Symbolist movement, its pages    were an outlet for early Mallarm\u00e9 as well as for pre- and proto-Symbolist    poets such as Baudelaire, Dierx, H\u00e9r\u00e9dia, and Leconte    de Lisle.            La Pl\u00e9iade    Location: microfilm, under title Parnasse Contemporain       Paris, Vol. 1 (No. 1-7), Mar. 1886 - Nov. 1886; 1-2, 1889    - 1890    Founded by Rodolphe Darzens, La Pl\u00e9iade had among its    contributors Ephraim Mikhael, Saint-Pol-Roux, P. Quillard, Ren\u00e9    Ghil, Maeterlinck, van Lerberghe, and others. The later series included    work by Brinn Gaubast, Tailhade, Rachilde, Barr\u00e8s, Aurier, Dubus,    and Dumur. It was La Pl\u00e9iade that was the immediate    predecessor of Mercure de France .            La Plume (9 reels)    Location: microfilm, under title Plume       Paris, Vol 1-25, Apr. 15, 1889 - July 1913.    One of the most important journals of the period, probably second in    importance to Mercure de France . It was founded by Deschamps    and included contributions from all the various literary currents afoot:    Symbolism, Decadentism, Occultism, Regionalism, etc. It contains many    special issues on such figures as Mor\u00e9as, Baudelaire, Verlaine,    and such schools as the F\u00e9libres, the D\u00e9cadents, and the    Occultists. Also included are many graphics and plates.            Le Reveil; Recueil Mensuel de Litt\u00e9rature et d&#39;Art   (2 reels)    Location: microfilm, under title Reveil       Bruxelles, Vol. 1-6, 1891 - 96    This journal became important for French literary movements beginning    in 1892. It contains contributions by Souchon, Vi\u00e9l\u00e9-Griffin,    Klingsor, R\u00e9gnier, and Herold.            La Revue Blanche (8 reels)    Location: microfilm, under title Revue Blanche       Paris, Vol. 1-30, Oct. 1891 - Apr. 14, 1903    Founded by Alexandre Natanson, this magazine was, along with L&#39;Ermitage ,     Mercure de France , and La Plume , one of the most important    journals of the nineties. Like them it was devoted to much more than    Symbolism or even literature. It was a fully general review of all the    arts and related intellectual currents. Mallarm\u00e9, Vi\u00e9l\u00e9-Griffin,    Gourmont, Kahn, Blum, Bernard, Mauclair, and Dujardin are among its    contributors. For a time Debussy wrote its musical reviews. Like La    Plume it contains many interesting graphics, some being lithographs    by Toulouse-Lautrec and others.            Revue d&#39;Aujourd&#39;hui    Location: microfilm, under title Revue d&#39;Aujourd&#39;hui       Paris, Vol. 1-2, (No. 1-15), Jan. - Sept. 1890    Tola Dorian edited this journal in collaboration with Darzens. Two of    the high points of its brief existence were Mallarm\u00e9&#39;s essay    &quot;Villiers de l&#39;Isle Adam,&quot; and Villiers de l&#39;Isle Adam&#39;s own piece.    &quot;Amour Sublime.&quot;            Revue Ind\u00e9pendante de Litt\u00e9rature et d&#39;Art   (8 reels)    Location: microfilm, under title Revue Ind\u00e9pendante   de Litt\u00e9rature et d&#39;Art       Paris, Vol. 1-2, May    1884 - Apr. 1885; Series 2 Vol. 1, May 1885; Series 3 Vol. 1-26 (No.    1-797), Nov 1886 - Sept. 1895.    Founded by F\u00e9n\u00e9on, this magazine was one of the critical    outlets of Mallarm\u00e9&#39;s group, though it contains items by other    Symbolists and non-Symbolists. Some of its contributors are Villiers    de l&#39;Isle-Adam, Barr\u00e8s, Bourges, P\u00e9ladan, Vignier, Ghil,    Laforgue, Mor\u00e9as, and Wyzewa.            La Revue Naturiste    Location: microfilm, under title Revue Naturiste       Paris, Vol. 1-2, 1897 - 1898    As its title indicates this journal was an organ for Naturism. Among    its contributors were Boub\u00e9lier, Montfort, Le Blond, Viollis,    and Fleury.            La Revue Wagn\u00e9rienne    Location: microfilm, under title Revue naturiste       Paris, Vol. 1-3, 1885 - 1888    This magazine testifies throughout its pages to the enormous influence    of Wagner in the arts other than music during the second half of the    nineteenth century. The Symbolists were especially interested in Wagner&#39;s    attempt to synthesize music and poetic drama and they contributed eagerly    to the pages of the Revue . Included are poems and articles    by Mallarm\u00e9, Ghil, Merrill, Vignier, Dujardin, Verlaine, and    Teodor de Wyzewa.            Le Scapin    Location: microfilm, under title Revue naturiste       Paris, Vol. 1-2, Dec. 1, 1885 - Aug. 16, 1886; Series 2,    Nos. 1-9, Sept. 1, 1886 - Dec 31, 1886    This was one of Alfred Vallette&#39;s early outlets. It also includes poems    and essays by Mallarm\u00e9, Verlaine, Tailhade, Rachilde, Renard,    Samain, Dubus, Lorrain, Le Cardonnel, and Ghil. From its contributors,    it might be regarded as the grandfather of Mercure de France    with La Pl\u00e9iade being the father.            La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nouvelle; Revue Internationale. Sociologie,   Arts, Sciences, Lettres    Location: microfilm, under title Soci\u00e9t\u00e9   Nouvelle       Brussels, etc., Vol. 1-53, No. 1, 1884 - July/Sept.    1914    Founded and first edited by Fernand Brouez, this journal was one of    the major fixtures in Belgian literary and cultural circles. It crossed    paths with Symbolism particularly during the years 1892 - 1895, when    contributions by Gustave Kahn, R\u00e9gnier, Saint-Pol-Roux, and Vi\u00e9l\u00e9-Griffin    frequently marked its pages. Like Mercure de France , its scope    was much broader than literature alone, as its sub-title testifies.    Its pages included some of the early French translations of Nietzsche.            Les Taches d&#39;Encre    Location: microfilm, under title Taches d&#39;Encre       Paris, Nos. 1-4, Nov. 5, 1884 - Feb. 1885    This was Maurice Barr\u00e8s&#39;s own private journal. It is most important    for its essay on Baudelaire in which the emerging Symbolist poetry was    discussed under the rubric of &quot;d\u00e9cadent.&quot;            La Vogue (2 reels)    Location: microfilm, under title Vogue       Paris, Vol. 1-3, 1886 - 1887; Jan. 1899 - May 1901    This magazine was first published by Leo d&#39;Orfer and Gustave Kahn. It    is especially important for its publication of Rimbaud. Also included    are items by Laforgue, Mallarm\u00e9, Kahn, Vignier, Verlaine, Ghil,    and, from the later period, Klingsor, Merrill, Pilon, Fleury, Verhaeren,    Jammes, and Gasquet.
