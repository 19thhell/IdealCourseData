This virtual object that appears on the playing surface (sports scores during a TV match is another example) is, in fact, augmented reality in action.   But the use of augmented reality (also known as AR) isn't just limited to the world of sports. Augmented reality\u2014the modification of a user's view using computer graphics, sounds, video, and other data\u2014is used every day to insert digital and virtual information into your real-world environment. Heads-up displays in automobiles, animated advertisements in catalogs and on product labels, and wearable eyewear like Google Glass are all examples of how people are using this fast-growing technology.   According to Ken Perlin, professor of computer science in the Media Research Lab at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and Director of the Games for Learning Institute (see the Connect article &quot; Video Games &amp; the Future of Learning ,&quot; April 2012), augmented reality will play a key role in creating a more blended, interactive experience in and outside the classroom.   &quot;I think the greatest impact of augmented reality will be further out as it gradually becomes an integral part of everyday life,&quot; states Perlin. &quot;Just as we\u2019ve moved in the last six years to iPhone and Android devices, we\u2019ll similarly move to wearables over the next decade. After that, augmented reality will be integral to all fields of activity, including learning and higher education.&quot;   The NYU Community is already getting a glimpse of the possibilities around AR with the help of research groups such as the Mobile Augmented Reality Lab. Working out of the Media and Games Network space in Brooklyn, the Lab is exploring emerging AR technologies in areas ranging from voice recognition to 3D visualizations and gaming. The group\u2019s varied projects reflect AR technology\u2019s far-reaching potential in enhancing users\u2019 perception of the world they see, feel, and hear around them.   &quot;The meaning of augmented reality is constantly changing. For most people, augmented reality has largely meant seeing computer graphics superimposed onto the screen of a user\u2019s camera phone,&quot; says Perlin. &quot;But that will all dramatically change as we shift to wearables. When this transition is complete, we\u2019ll be entering the dawn of \u2018the age of computer graphics\u2019 when the augmentation of reality can be seen anywhere, at any time, without needing to hold up a device.&quot;   Augmented Reality in Action   While many augmented reality apps require special headgear to use, new mobile apps are designed to work with smartphones equipped with components such as an accelerometer, compass, and GPS. An Internet connection and video camera, coupled with software that recognizes computer-generated content (e.g., images), allows the device to display graphical data onto physical objects.   Augmented reality is at the center of Tunnel Vision NYC , a project conceived by recent Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) graduate, Bill Lindmeier. Like many AR apps, Tunnel Vision uses GPS to establish and search for objects, people, and stores near a smartphone user\u2019s location. The iOS app brings New York City\u2019s subway map to life by allowing users to overlay animated visualizations (see video at right) of the city\u2019s transit and census data onto their smartphone display.   &quot;The idea was an evolving process with the help of my thesis class, but it sits at the junction of a few interests of mine: computer vision, data visualization, and the subway system,&quot; says Lindmeier. By holding your smartphone up to a wall, paper, or onscreen map, Tunnel Vision transmits real-time information on turnstile activity and the estimated positions of trains en route to stations.   On what inspired him to create Tunnel Vision, Lindmeier reflects, &quot;My initial motivation was to create a portrait of New York City through data. I wanted to create an interactive experience that could reveal stories about the people and neighborhoods that make up the city.&quot;   Another ITP student, Adarsh Kosuru, debuted his Slit app at the 2013 ITP Winter Show to demonstrate how a phone camera can use augmented reality to identify objects and trigger specific actions. Based on ofxQCAR (Qualcomm's AR addon for openFrameworks), Slit tags objects with images, sound, or text. Slit users can then point their phone camera at an appliance, television, or other connected device, which then presents controls that enable users to interact with real objects.   &quot;By using simple gestures, rules can be set to connect multiple objects together to trigger them simultaneously. For example, this can be useful in situations where a user wants to switch off all home appliances while watching TV to reduce home energy use,&quot; says Kosuru.   Ushering in the &quot;Age of Computer Graphics&quot;   With AR introducing a new wave of apps that allow users to animate, explore, and geotag images on mobile devices, it\u2019s no surprise educators are also incorporating these technologies inside the classroom. &quot;I\u2019ll be teaching a computer graphics course this fall using an augmented reality \u2018magic whiteboard,\u2019 in which everything I draw on the board will turn into animated diagrams, simulations, and 3D visualizations. This new way of teaching is based on work coming out of the current research in our lab,&quot; reveals Perlin.   Taking their work with augmented reality one step further, the Games for Learning Institute is working to improve videoconferencing by employing eye contact to signal subtle meaning and emphasis. Other current projects include a collaboration with the NYU Langone Medical Center, which involves the development of interactive augmented visualizations of the human heart for diagnostic assessment and pre-surgical planning.

In this course we will explore the technology that enables the consumption and production of media on these devices with an eye towards how that media can be used in conjunction with the devices' original social and communicative purposes. In short, this course will examine social and participatory aspects of mobile media consumption and generation. Students will create projects that utilize the available technology to explore new forms of social media creation and consumption.

This virtual object that appears on the playing surface (sports scores during a TV match is another example) is, in fact, augmented reality in action.   But the use of augmented reality (also known as AR) isn't just limited to the world of sports. Augmented reality\u2014the modification of a user's view using computer graphics, sounds, video, and other data\u2014is used every day to insert digital and virtual information into your real-world environment. Heads-up displays in automobiles, animated advertisements in catalogs and on product labels, and wearable eyewear like Google Glass are all examples of how people are using this fast-growing technology.   According to Ken Perlin, professor of computer science in the Media Research Lab at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and Director of the Games for Learning Institute (see the Connect article &quot; Video Games &amp; the Future of Learning ,&quot; April 2012), augmented reality will play a key role in creating a more blended, interactive experience in and outside the classroom.   &quot;I think the greatest impact of augmented reality will be further out as it gradually becomes an integral part of everyday life,&quot; states Perlin. &quot;Just as we\u2019ve moved in the last six years to iPhone and Android devices, we\u2019ll similarly move to wearables over the next decade. After that, augmented reality will be integral to all fields of activity, including learning and higher education.&quot;   The NYU Community is already getting a glimpse of the possibilities around AR with the help of research groups such as the Mobile Augmented Reality Lab. Working out of the Media and Games Network space in Brooklyn, the Lab is exploring emerging AR technologies in areas ranging from voice recognition to 3D visualizations and gaming. The group\u2019s varied projects reflect AR technology\u2019s far-reaching potential in enhancing users\u2019 perception of the world they see, feel, and hear around them.   &quot;The meaning of augmented reality is constantly changing. For most people, augmented reality has largely meant seeing computer graphics superimposed onto the screen of a user\u2019s camera phone,&quot; says Perlin. &quot;But that will all dramatically change as we shift to wearables. When this transition is complete, we\u2019ll be entering the dawn of \u2018the age of computer graphics\u2019 when the augmentation of reality can be seen anywhere, at any time, without needing to hold up a device.&quot;   Augmented Reality in Action   While many augmented reality apps require special headgear to use, new mobile apps are designed to work with smartphones equipped with components such as an accelerometer, compass, and GPS. An Internet connection and video camera, coupled with software that recognizes computer-generated content (e.g., images), allows the device to display graphical data onto physical objects.   Augmented reality is at the center of Tunnel Vision NYC , a project conceived by recent Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) graduate, Bill Lindmeier. Like many AR apps, Tunnel Vision uses GPS to establish and search for objects, people, and stores near a smartphone user\u2019s location. The iOS app brings New York City\u2019s subway map to life by allowing users to overlay animated visualizations (see video at right) of the city\u2019s transit and census data onto their smartphone display.   &quot;The idea was an evolving process with the help of my thesis class, but it sits at the junction of a few interests of mine: computer vision, data visualization, and the subway system,&quot; says Lindmeier. By holding your smartphone up to a wall, paper, or onscreen map, Tunnel Vision transmits real-time information on turnstile activity and the estimated positions of trains en route to stations.   On what inspired him to create Tunnel Vision, Lindmeier reflects, &quot;My initial motivation was to create a portrait of New York City through data. I wanted to create an interactive experience that could reveal stories about the people and neighborhoods that make up the city.&quot;   Another ITP student, Adarsh Kosuru, debuted his Slit app at the 2013 ITP Winter Show to demonstrate how a phone camera can use augmented reality to identify objects and trigger specific actions. Based on ofxQCAR (Qualcomm's AR addon for openFrameworks), Slit tags objects with images, sound, or text. Slit users can then point their phone camera at an appliance, television, or other connected device, which then presents controls that enable users to interact with real objects.   &quot;By using simple gestures, rules can be set to connect multiple objects together to trigger them simultaneously. For example, this can be useful in situations where a user wants to switch off all home appliances while watching TV to reduce home energy use,&quot; says Kosuru.   Ushering in the &quot;Age of Computer Graphics&quot;   With AR introducing a new wave of apps that allow users to animate, explore, and geotag images on mobile devices, it\u2019s no surprise educators are also incorporating these technologies inside the classroom. &quot;I\u2019ll be teaching a computer graphics course this fall using an augmented reality \u2018magic whiteboard,\u2019 in which everything I draw on the board will turn into animated diagrams, simulations, and 3D visualizations. This new way of teaching is based on work coming out of the current research in our lab,&quot; reveals Perlin.   Taking their work with augmented reality one step further, the Games for Learning Institute is working to improve videoconferencing by employing eye contact to signal subtle meaning and emphasis. Other current projects include a collaboration with the NYU Langone Medical Center, which involves the development of interactive augmented visualizations of the human heart for diagnostic assessment and pre-surgical planning.

students to the possibilities and capabilities of interactive tools, whether hardware or software, and to teach them how to understand and create new experiences with those tools.   It is also designed to serve as a crossroads for a variety of disciplines, from engineering and computer science to the social sciences and the arts. This mixing is built into the courses themselves and embodied in the interactive lab, an environment where scientists and artists come together with curious students and faculty to imagine new forms of media and technology.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

This course studies these technologies through the lens of social, political, and ethical values investigating whether and how technical systems promote or impede values to which we are committed. While we explore concepts and literatures, students form collaborative groups, select projects and apply philosophical and social theories of technology to analyze and, possibly, design, prototype, and build systems. The course welcomes students with a variety of backgrounds and skills, though some prior understanding of and experience with digital technology and media, and computing or social, political, and ethical analysis is recommended.

MDMED-AD 116 Mashups - Creating with Web APIs                                             As the World Wide Web continues to grow and pervade our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are becoming accessible to us through public web APIs - Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, these web APIs offer a way to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. How might we use these available resources to create unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own? Subscribing to a process-oriented approach, much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, primarily Javascript, for client-side (front-end) web development.

In this course we will explore the technology that enables the consumption and production of media on these devices with an eye towards how that media can be used in conjunction with the devices' original social and communicative purposes. In short, this course will examine social and participatory aspects of mobile media consumption and generation. Students will create projects that utilize the available technology to explore new forms of social media creation and consumption.       In this course will cover Multimedia Messaging, the mobile web, mobile photography, mobile video, live streaming, geocoding and more. We will utilize both PHP (web side) and Mobile Processing (device side) (possibly Flash Light and/or Android as well) for development. ICM is a prerequisite. Mobile Application Development (experience with Mobile Processing) and/or Dynamic Web Development (experience with PHP) and/or FlashLite although not required, are helpful.

We will utilize PHP and HTML (web side) and Android (device side). ICM is a prerequisite.            Administrative:     Office Hours:    Tuesdays from 4PM to 5PM    Signup: https://www.itp.nyu.edu/~sve204/cgi-bin/pwiki/wiki.pl?OfficeHours      Grading:    25% Assignments    25% Class Participation/Attendance    20% Final Project    15% Midterm    15% Presentation      Assignments and Blog:    We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to the previous weeks material. Assignments must be documented (descriptions, photos, screen shots, code, thoughts, and so on) on your blog (see below). They are required and turning in an assignment late will adversely affect your grade.        It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments as well as other related material. You are welcome to reuse an existing blog but please make it clear which entries are for this course (perhaps with a category). If you don't have a domain or feel comfortable installing your own blog software, feel free to utilize the blogging software that ITP has setup here: http://itp.nyu.edu/blogs/ .       Be sure to enter your name, preferred email address and the URL to your blog (you can always edit this later) on the class wiki      Listserv:    This class is very participatory in nature and discussions will certainly take place outside of the classroom. The primary vehicle for these discussions (as well as administrative issues) will be the listserv. You are required to signup .     Presentations:    Each week (starting the 3rd week of class) we will have student presentations. I will randomly divide up the class and schedule the presentation dates. The topic of the presentations should be a new or somewhat new mobile media technology (hardware, software or service) that relates to the previous topics in the class. The presentations should cover what the technology/service is, what is novel about it, how are people using it and so on.        Final Projects    Class will culminate with final group projects. Being that this is a group project, it will be difficult to work on a thesis project as the final project for this class. Combinations with other classes that you are taking (aside from thesis) are encouraged.         Class Participation    This class will be highly participatory, you are expected to contribute to discussions and give feedback to other students. This (along with attendance) is 25% of your overall grade.      Attendance:     Mandatory , unexcused absences will affect your final grade. If you are going to be absent, please let me know ahead of time if you can.        Tardiness:    Excessive lateness will affect your grade. Don't be late.        Laptops:    Laptop use is prohibited while other students are presenting or during discussion. While I am lecturing you may use them for note taking or class related work. In other words, respect your fellow students and don't check your email.          Reading:    There will be assigned periodic readings. Generally they will be online though occasionally I may hand out a hard copy. These readings are required and are very valuable in class discussions.        Websites:    There are quite a few blogs and other websites that track the wireless industry. These along with what we collectively find (use the del.icio.us tag mobilemedia ) are good starting points:        SmartMobs     MobileCrunch     textually.org         Weekly Rundown:      Week 1    Introductions: Discussion, Syllabus, Examples, Phones, Carriers, SMS    Notes   Homework:   Do Reading: Chapter 7 of The Mobile Revolution: The Making of Mobile Services Worldwide by Dan Steinbock    Find SMS based interactions or campaigns that you think are interesting.

This virtual object that appears on the playing surface (sports scores during a TV match is another example) is, in fact, augmented reality in action.   But the use of augmented reality (also known as AR) isn't just limited to the world of sports. Augmented reality\u2014the modification of a user's view using computer graphics, sounds, video, and other data\u2014is used every day to insert digital and virtual information into your real-world environment. Heads-up displays in automobiles, animated advertisements in catalogs and on product labels, and wearable eyewear like Google Glass are all examples of how people are using this fast-growing technology.   According to Ken Perlin, professor of computer science in the Media Research Lab at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and Director of the Games for Learning Institute (see the Connect article &quot; Video Games &amp; the Future of Learning ,&quot; April 2012), augmented reality will play a key role in creating a more blended, interactive experience in and outside the classroom.   &quot;I think the greatest impact of augmented reality will be further out as it gradually becomes an integral part of everyday life,&quot; states Perlin. &quot;Just as we\u2019ve moved in the last six years to iPhone and Android devices, we\u2019ll similarly move to wearables over the next decade. After that, augmented reality will be integral to all fields of activity, including learning and higher education.&quot;   The NYU Community is already getting a glimpse of the possibilities around AR with the help of research groups such as the Mobile Augmented Reality Lab. Working out of the Media and Games Network space in Brooklyn, the Lab is exploring emerging AR technologies in areas ranging from voice recognition to 3D visualizations and gaming. The group\u2019s varied projects reflect AR technology\u2019s far-reaching potential in enhancing users\u2019 perception of the world they see, feel, and hear around them.   &quot;The meaning of augmented reality is constantly changing. For most people, augmented reality has largely meant seeing computer graphics superimposed onto the screen of a user\u2019s camera phone,&quot; says Perlin. &quot;But that will all dramatically change as we shift to wearables. When this transition is complete, we\u2019ll be entering the dawn of \u2018the age of computer graphics\u2019 when the augmentation of reality can be seen anywhere, at any time, without needing to hold up a device.&quot;   Augmented Reality in Action   While many augmented reality apps require special headgear to use, new mobile apps are designed to work with smartphones equipped with components such as an accelerometer, compass, and GPS. An Internet connection and video camera, coupled with software that recognizes computer-generated content (e.g., images), allows the device to display graphical data onto physical objects.   Augmented reality is at the center of Tunnel Vision NYC , a project conceived by recent Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) graduate, Bill Lindmeier. Like many AR apps, Tunnel Vision uses GPS to establish and search for objects, people, and stores near a smartphone user\u2019s location. The iOS app brings New York City\u2019s subway map to life by allowing users to overlay animated visualizations (see video at right) of the city\u2019s transit and census data onto their smartphone display.   &quot;The idea was an evolving process with the help of my thesis class, but it sits at the junction of a few interests of mine: computer vision, data visualization, and the subway system,&quot; says Lindmeier. By holding your smartphone up to a wall, paper, or onscreen map, Tunnel Vision transmits real-time information on turnstile activity and the estimated positions of trains en route to stations.   On what inspired him to create Tunnel Vision, Lindmeier reflects, &quot;My initial motivation was to create a portrait of New York City through data. I wanted to create an interactive experience that could reveal stories about the people and neighborhoods that make up the city.&quot;   Another ITP student, Adarsh Kosuru, debuted his Slit app at the 2013 ITP Winter Show to demonstrate how a phone camera can use augmented reality to identify objects and trigger specific actions. Based on ofxQCAR (Qualcomm's AR addon for openFrameworks), Slit tags objects with images, sound, or text. Slit users can then point their phone camera at an appliance, television, or other connected device, which then presents controls that enable users to interact with real objects.   &quot;By using simple gestures, rules can be set to connect multiple objects together to trigger them simultaneously. For example, this can be useful in situations where a user wants to switch off all home appliances while watching TV to reduce home energy use,&quot; says Kosuru.   Ushering in the &quot;Age of Computer Graphics&quot;   With AR introducing a new wave of apps that allow users to animate, explore, and geotag images on mobile devices, it\u2019s no surprise educators are also incorporating these technologies inside the classroom. &quot;I\u2019ll be teaching a computer graphics course this fall using an augmented reality \u2018magic whiteboard,\u2019 in which everything I draw on the board will turn into animated diagrams, simulations, and 3D visualizations. This new way of teaching is based on work coming out of the current research in our lab,&quot; reveals Perlin.   Taking their work with augmented reality one step further, the Games for Learning Institute is working to improve videoconferencing by employing eye contact to signal subtle meaning and emphasis. Other current projects include a collaboration with the NYU Langone Medical Center, which involves the development of interactive augmented visualizations of the human heart for diagnostic assessment and pre-surgical planning.
