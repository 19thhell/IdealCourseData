A free magazine with a hard-working staff would normally make their content available on the web. We may be free, but we\u2019re certainly not hard-working, so don\u2019t get your hopes up.   The Plague is one of the few surviving outlets for humor in Lower Manhattan since the Bird Flu Epidemic of 2005. Drop by a meeting sometime: Mondays at 6:30 P.M. in Room 708 of the Kimmel Center .   If you\u2019ve made it this far (by my count, it\u2019s been 96 words), read our sample articles and lists or our investigation into the history and beginnings of The Plague . But to best ingratiate yourself with the staff, to later swindle us, come to our meetings or sign up for our mailing list .   If you\u2019re busy during our meetings, or just lazy, you can send all contributions to &#112;&#x6c;&#x61;&#x67;&#x75;&#x65;&#46;&#x6d;&#x61;&#103;&#x61;&#x7a;&#105;&#110;&#101;&#x40;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d; .
