At New York University, these are not and have never been just buzzwords, but principles so central to the mission of the University that students may not even notice how much use they make of them.       In the heart of the most ethnically varied city in the country, and arguably the world, NYU\u2019s classrooms often mirror the energizing diversity found on the street. Our main campus attracts applicants from every corner of the globe, and likewise faculty, who hail from X different nations. Diversity is more than a statistic here, and the wealth of resources available to promote diversity and to acclimate international students and scholars , coupled with the multicultural events offered throughout the year, show that NYU is committed to fostering an ever stronger multiculturalism in both faculty and students while ensuring at the same time that no single gender, nationality, race, religion, or lifestyle has a monopoly on intellect or talent.     But how does multiculturalism flourish when it is bound within one culture, even if that culture is as wonderfully heterogeneous as New York? Within the classroom walls, a global experience is only partially possible \u2013 unless those classroom walls can reach from Shanghai to Berlin. NYU\u2019s unparalleled international presence offers students a unique opportunity to conduct their studies where they are most relevant: read Italian poetry in the birthplace of the Renaissance, get an MBA in one of the most robust economies in the world, compose music among the ghosts of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Smetana.       Spanning six continents, New York University operates ten fully functional academic sites, most equipped for graduate study; fifteen more are open on seasonal and conditional basis. NYU is also developing a campus in Abu Dhabi , which will offer students a seamless transference of NYU\u2019s academic and financial resources. Beyond these, NYU holds agreements with scores of universities and research institutes throughout the world: for example, the Stockholm School of Economics and the HEC School of Management in Paris.       As a graduate and a professional student, you will want to factor your time abroad into your academic timelines very carefully, scheduling around teaching, exams, and other requirements that would need to be completed in New York, but don\u2019t let this be an obstacle. Our sites offer many courses and fieldwork opportunities that satisfy departmental obligations, and agreements with local libraries and archives will provide invaluable, often unimaginable supplements to your research.       Of American universities NYU annually hosts the highest number of students abroad, a statistic we are very pleased to repeat. But more important is the quality of our international education, and we feel we are equally distinguished in this category.

This Global Network University model has emerged as a natural and logical extension of NYU\u2019s research and teaching agendas; flowing from our eco-systemic relation to New York City, the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs\u2014and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty. Students and faculty interact with their urban environment in countless meaningful and essential ways, using these locations as a major asset.   Students and faculty alike broaden the scope of vision and knowledge through international learning. Opportunities include study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming offered through the specific schools or departments. All locations within the network are also accessible for individual research that springs from individual academic ideas and goals.   Access to the World   NYU has never thought of itself as a gated community. It has always encouraged its students to think of themselves as participants in and shapers of a complex and changing environment. Indeed, part of NYU\u2019s teaching mission consists in preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and faculty at NYU believe that such preparation is most effective when the outside world is not held at bay. This same principle holds true as we create a Global Network University that is both \u201cin and of the city\u201d and \u201cin and of the world.\u201d   Our locations beyond our campus in New York City include NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, TischAsia in Singapore, NYU Law in Singapore, and 10 academic sites in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC.   Direct exchange programs with 12 distinguished partner institutions, 27 summer session locations, an ever-changing roster of intersession programming offered by NYU\u2019s various schools, colleges, and programs, and curriculum-driven initiatives expand the global network\u2014from Beijing to Johannesburg, Santiago to Vienna.   Around the world, students work closely with faculty and with their peers on shared commitments. They apply what they learn and develop the skills and qualities\u2014both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world.                                                      Study Abroad and Study Away International education is a long-standing part of New York University's global mission which includes a wide range of initiatives both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the exchange of knowledge across international boundaries.

But how does multiculturalism flourish when it is bound within one culture, even if that culture is as wonderfully heterogeneous as New York? Within the classroom walls, a global experience is only partially possible \u2013 unless those classroom walls can reach from Shanghai to Berlin. NYU\u2019s unparalleled international presence offers students a unique opportunity to conduct their studies where they are most relevant: read Italian poetry in the birthplace of the Renaissance, get an MBA in one of the most robust economies in the world, compose music among the ghosts of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Smetana.       Spanning six continents, New York University operates ten fully functional academic sites, most equipped for graduate study; fifteen more are open on seasonal and conditional basis. NYU is also developing a campus in Abu Dhabi , which will offer students a seamless transference of NYU\u2019s academic and financial resources. Beyond these, NYU holds agreements with scores of universities and research institutes throughout the world: for example, the Stockholm School of Economics and the HEC School of Management in Paris.       As a graduate and a professional student, you will want to factor your time abroad into your academic timelines very carefully, scheduling around teaching, exams, and other requirements that would need to be completed in New York, but don\u2019t let this be an obstacle. Our sites offer many courses and fieldwork opportunities that satisfy departmental obligations, and agreements with local libraries and archives will provide invaluable, often unimaginable supplements to your research.       Of American universities NYU annually hosts the highest number of students abroad, a statistic we are very pleased to repeat. But more important is the quality of our international education, and we feel we are equally distinguished in this category.
