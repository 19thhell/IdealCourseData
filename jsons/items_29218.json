Nighttime at Singapore&#39;s Marina Bay   Singapore is a city, a country, and an island.\u00a0 In many ways it is the center of the Southeast Asian legal community, as many international law firms operating in the region base themselves here.\u00a0Culturally, Singapore boasts a unique blend of Chinese, Indian, and Malay influences.\u00a0The national language is English, although it might be more accurate to say it is Singlish , an interesting local slang that I am still trying to fully grasp. (For beginners, just add &#8220;la&#8221; at the end of a few sentences, and you&#8217;ll get by just fine.)    NUS Law is next to Singapore&#39;s Botanic Gardens   Courses at NUS are known as \u201cmodules,\u201d and as an exchange student I am to fulfill 16 NUS credits in order to receive 12 NYU credits.\u00a0The four four-credit modules in which I am registered are not too different from typical offerings at NYU; I am enrolled in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Entertainment Law, International Commercial Arbitration, and Foreign Direct Investment in Asia.\u00a0Nonetheless, my classroom experience has been rather unique in comparison with what I\u2019ve come to know at NYU.   I am the only American in any of my modules   I attend lectures alongside Singaporean undergraduate students, international exchange students, and graduate LL.M. students.\u00a0In keeping with the broad diversity of the class rosters, many of my courses take a comparative approach to legal analysis.\u00a0We review casework from a variety of jurisdictions, including both common law and civil law systems, although the majority of the cases and legislation that we study come from the U.S., the U.K., or Singapore.   As the \u201ctoken American,\u201d I am often called upon to offer an American perspective on whatever discussion may be occurring. Sometimes the questions are strictly academic, such as explaining the U.S. style of footnoting or assisting my baffled classmates in understanding why two corporations would want to perform a reverse triangular merger.   But other questions have been more\u2026 off-the-cuff. For example, during my very first Entertainment Law lecture, which focuses on pop iconography and celebrity, I was called on several times to express my thoughts on various aspects of American culture. The highlights: describing the impact that Tiger Woods\u2019s scandal has had on his image, explaining the significance of spam within American culture, and contemplating what \u201ctalents\u201d have given Paris Hilton her celebrity status.\u00a0You know, classic \u201cSocratic method\u201d-type questions.   Lectures are three hours long    Course materials are distributed into our lockers   Studying at NUS Law is truly testing the limits of my attention span.\u00a0Although three of my four modules meet just once per week, each lecture is a thorough three-hour session.\u00a0My fourth module, dubbed an &#8220;intensive,&#8221; concluded after the first three weeks of the semester, but during that time we met three times per week, three hours each time.\u00a0After enduring a few Hurricane Sandy-lengthened lectures at NYU at the end of last semester, I thought I might be prepared for the adjustment to longer sessions. I was wrong.\u00a0At times I feel as if there\u2019s not enough powdered instant Nescaf\u00e9 in all of Singapore to keep me alert for the duration of each lecture.\u00a0But sleepiness aside, the long classes do allow us to cover a remarkable amount of material, and it is not unusual for professors to address over 100 pages of reading in a single class.   Attendance counts   In every class that I\u2019ve taken so far at NYU, the final grade that I received has been based entirely on my performance on one culminating assessment, whether it was an in-class exam, a take-home exam, or a research paper.\u00a0But at NUS, professors evaluate student performance throughout the duration of each module with various graded research papers, group projects, or simulations.\u00a0Even attendance and classroom participation can contribute to some percentage of a student\u2019s overall grade.\u00a0In an extreme case, my Foreign Direct Investment in Asia module involves a lengthy in-class contract negotiation, and as such attendance and classroom participation comprise 50% of the final grade.   Extracurricular activities     A quick tangent: I remember about a year ago I was sitting through one of the mandatory PILC summer funding info sessions.\u00a0I knew that I wanted to spend my 1L summer working abroad.\u00a0One of the final slides of the PowerPoint presentation that day was a photo of a beach umbrella; the PILC counselor on stage quipped, \u201cYou can go ANYWHERE! Just don&#8217;t go sit on the beach all summer!&#8221; I think he was joking, but in a &#8220;No, really, we&#8217;re giving you this money, please don&#8217;t go sit on the beach&#8221; sort of tone.\u00a0I heeded the advice and spent my summer working in Beijing, where I basked in pollution and smog rather than UV rays.    Escape to the beaches of Bali in under three hours   Studying in Singapore offers the opportunity to pursue a rigorous legal education\u2026 without sacrificing that beach umbrella.\u00a0NUS students can take advantage of short, inexpensive flights to countless destinations across Asia; popular getaways in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines are all easily accessible. \u00a0University-wide holidays such as Chinese New Year, a mid-semester recess week (Singapore\u2019s version of spring break), and an additional reading week at the conclusion of classes offer plenty of opportunities to travel.\u00a0So if you\u2019re looking to spend your free time frolicking around Southeast Asia, then Singapore has that going for it, too&#8230; which is nice.   There\u2019s even a bit of paradise on campus.\u00a0I live in an apartment-style dormitory in the massive residential area of the NUS campus known as University Town .\u00a0A few weeks ago, the school opened a brand new infinity pool for students just across the lawn from my residence hall.\u00a0Even when you\u2019re not traveling, you can still take in the sunshine and gaze out over the sprawling green campus below.\u00a0After you finish reading all of those documents your professor left in your locker, of course.      On-campus infinity pool   My unsolicited advice to any prospective students or 1Ls who may be reading this: go abroad during your time at NYU.\u00a0Although there&#8217;s still a lot that I miss about Manhattan, I am thoroughly enjoying my semester as an exchange student in Singapore.\u00a0The international atmosphere, cultural diversity, and array of local cuisines all present a welcome change of pace.\u00a0At the very least, my time here is helping me through the post-1L malaise that seems to afflict all law students.\u00a0If you&#8217;re even the slightest bit interested in an international career, or if the prospect of three years of law school in the same place just sounds monotonous to you, then consider one of NYU Law&#8217;s many exchange programs or three new study-abroad options .\u00a0Don&#8217;t worry, you can thank me later.

This Global Network University model has emerged as a natural and logical extension of NYU\u2019s research and teaching agendas; flowing from our eco-systemic relation to New York City, the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs\u2014and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty. Students and faculty interact with their urban environment in countless meaningful and essential ways, using these locations as a major asset.   Students and faculty alike broaden the scope of vision and knowledge through international learning. Opportunities include study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming offered through the specific schools or departments. All locations within the network are also accessible for individual research that springs from individual academic ideas and goals.   Access to the World   NYU has never thought of itself as a gated community. It has always encouraged its students to think of themselves as participants in and shapers of a complex and changing environment. Indeed, part of NYU\u2019s teaching mission consists in preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and faculty at NYU believe that such preparation is most effective when the outside world is not held at bay. This same principle holds true as we create a Global Network University that is both \u201cin and of the city\u201d and \u201cin and of the world.\u201d   Our locations beyond our campus in New York City include NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, TischAsia in Singapore, NYU Law in Singapore, and 10 academic sites in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC.   Direct exchange programs with 12 distinguished partner institutions, 27 summer session locations, an ever-changing roster of intersession programming offered by NYU\u2019s various schools, colleges, and programs, and curriculum-driven initiatives expand the global network\u2014from Beijing to Johannesburg, Santiago to Vienna.   Around the world, students work closely with faculty and with their peers on shared commitments. They apply what they learn and develop the skills and qualities\u2014both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world.                                                      Study Abroad and Study Away International education is a long-standing part of New York University's global mission which includes a wide range of initiatives both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the exchange of knowledge across international boundaries.

Nighttime at Singapore&#39;s Marina Bay   Singapore is a city, a country, and an island.\u00a0 In many ways it is the center of the Southeast Asian legal community, as many international law firms operating in the region base themselves here.\u00a0Culturally, Singapore boasts a unique blend of Chinese, Indian, and Malay influences.\u00a0The national language is English, although it might be more accurate to say it is Singlish , an interesting local slang that I am still trying to fully grasp. (For beginners, just add &#8220;la&#8221; at the end of a few sentences, and you&#8217;ll get by just fine.)    NUS Law is next to Singapore&#39;s Botanic Gardens   Courses at NUS are known as \u201cmodules,\u201d and as an exchange student I am to fulfill 16 NUS credits in order to receive 12 NYU credits.\u00a0The four four-credit modules in which I am registered are not too different from typical offerings at NYU; I am enrolled in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Entertainment Law, International Commercial Arbitration, and Foreign Direct Investment in Asia.\u00a0Nonetheless, my classroom experience has been rather unique in comparison with what I\u2019ve come to know at NYU.   I am the only American in any of my modules   I attend lectures alongside Singaporean undergraduate students, international exchange students, and graduate LL.M. students.\u00a0In keeping with the broad diversity of the class rosters, many of my courses take a comparative approach to legal analysis.\u00a0We review casework from a variety of jurisdictions, including both common law and civil law systems, although the majority of the cases and legislation that we study come from the U.S., the U.K., or Singapore.   As the \u201ctoken American,\u201d I am often called upon to offer an American perspective on whatever discussion may be occurring. Sometimes the questions are strictly academic, such as explaining the U.S. style of footnoting or assisting my baffled classmates in understanding why two corporations would want to perform a reverse triangular merger.   But other questions have been more\u2026 off-the-cuff. For example, during my very first Entertainment Law lecture, which focuses on pop iconography and celebrity, I was called on several times to express my thoughts on various aspects of American culture. The highlights: describing the impact that Tiger Woods\u2019s scandal has had on his image, explaining the significance of spam within American culture, and contemplating what \u201ctalents\u201d have given Paris Hilton her celebrity status.\u00a0You know, classic \u201cSocratic method\u201d-type questions.   Lectures are three hours long    Course materials are distributed into our lockers   Studying at NUS Law is truly testing the limits of my attention span.\u00a0Although three of my four modules meet just once per week, each lecture is a thorough three-hour session.\u00a0My fourth module, dubbed an &#8220;intensive,&#8221; concluded after the first three weeks of the semester, but during that time we met three times per week, three hours each time.\u00a0After enduring a few Hurricane Sandy-lengthened lectures at NYU at the end of last semester, I thought I might be prepared for the adjustment to longer sessions. I was wrong.\u00a0At times I feel as if there\u2019s not enough powdered instant Nescaf\u00e9 in all of Singapore to keep me alert for the duration of each lecture.\u00a0But sleepiness aside, the long classes do allow us to cover a remarkable amount of material, and it is not unusual for professors to address over 100 pages of reading in a single class.   Attendance counts   In every class that I\u2019ve taken so far at NYU, the final grade that I received has been based entirely on my performance on one culminating assessment, whether it was an in-class exam, a take-home exam, or a research paper.\u00a0But at NUS, professors evaluate student performance throughout the duration of each module with various graded research papers, group projects, or simulations.\u00a0Even attendance and classroom participation can contribute to some percentage of a student\u2019s overall grade.\u00a0In an extreme case, my Foreign Direct Investment in Asia module involves a lengthy in-class contract negotiation, and as such attendance and classroom participation comprise 50% of the final grade.   Extracurricular activities     A quick tangent: I remember about a year ago I was sitting through one of the mandatory PILC summer funding info sessions.\u00a0I knew that I wanted to spend my 1L summer working abroad.\u00a0One of the final slides of the PowerPoint presentation that day was a photo of a beach umbrella; the PILC counselor on stage quipped, \u201cYou can go ANYWHERE! Just don&#8217;t go sit on the beach all summer!&#8221; I think he was joking, but in a &#8220;No, really, we&#8217;re giving you this money, please don&#8217;t go sit on the beach&#8221; sort of tone.\u00a0I heeded the advice and spent my summer working in Beijing, where I basked in pollution and smog rather than UV rays.    Escape to the beaches of Bali in under three hours   Studying in Singapore offers the opportunity to pursue a rigorous legal education\u2026 without sacrificing that beach umbrella.\u00a0NUS students can take advantage of short, inexpensive flights to countless destinations across Asia; popular getaways in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines are all easily accessible. \u00a0University-wide holidays such as Chinese New Year, a mid-semester recess week (Singapore\u2019s version of spring break), and an additional reading week at the conclusion of classes offer plenty of opportunities to travel.\u00a0So if you\u2019re looking to spend your free time frolicking around Southeast Asia, then Singapore has that going for it, too&#8230; which is nice.   There\u2019s even a bit of paradise on campus.\u00a0I live in an apartment-style dormitory in the massive residential area of the NUS campus known as University Town .\u00a0A few weeks ago, the school opened a brand new infinity pool for students just across the lawn from my residence hall.\u00a0Even when you\u2019re not traveling, you can still take in the sunshine and gaze out over the sprawling green campus below.\u00a0After you finish reading all of those documents your professor left in your locker, of course.      On-campus infinity pool   My unsolicited advice to any prospective students or 1Ls who may be reading this: go abroad during your time at NYU.\u00a0Although there&#8217;s still a lot that I miss about Manhattan, I am thoroughly enjoying my semester as an exchange student in Singapore.\u00a0The international atmosphere, cultural diversity, and array of local cuisines all present a welcome change of pace.\u00a0At the very least, my time here is helping me through the post-1L malaise that seems to afflict all law students.\u00a0If you&#8217;re even the slightest bit interested in an international career, or if the prospect of three years of law school in the same place just sounds monotonous to you, then consider one of NYU Law&#8217;s many exchange programs or three new study-abroad options .\u00a0Don&#8217;t worry, you can thank me later.
