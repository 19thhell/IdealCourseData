The following is a summary of key regulations in New York. Links to regulations for family child care services in New York State, New Jersey, and Connecticut are listed in the right hand column.   Family Child Care   Family child care is an on-going arrangement in which child care is provided in someone's home on a regular basis for children aged 8 weeks through school-age for more than 3 hours per day per child.     Staff to Child Ratio   Individuals caring for 2 children or less are exempt from the licensing system.   Family Child Care - In a regulated family child care home, the provider may care for up to six children at one time, including the provider's own children under the age of 12 years.     If ANY children under 2 years of age, the maximum number in care is 5.     Group Family Child Care - A group family child care provider must have at least one assistant present during the hours care is provided. A group family child care provider and her assistant may care for 7 to 12 children at one time, including the provider's own children under the age of 12 years.     No more than 4 children under the age of 2 years may be in care at any time;  and no more than 6 children under the age of 3 years can be cared for at any one time.   If ANY children are under 2 years of age, the maximum number in care is 10.     If there are NO children under 2 years of age, the maximum number in care is 12.     Average Cost     The cost for family child care varies depending upon neighborhood. In NYC, the average cost of full-time care costs approximately $800/month. In the Greenwich Village area, the cost averages $1,800/month.     General Requirements of Staff and Other Adults     Screening - Any adult working, or in regular contact, with children must: submit three references, a recent medical form, including the results of a TB test, certify that they have never been convicted of a felony, submit fingerprints, and be screened through the NYS Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment. The NYS Office of Children and Families shall perform a criminal history record check of each.     Provider Qualifications - All providers must be at least 18 years of age and attend an orientation conducted by the NYC Department of Health and must have a minimum of 2 years of experience caring for children under the age of 6 years, or one year experience caring for children under 6 years of age, plus 6 hous of training or education in early childhood development.     Training Requirements - Ongoing professional development is part of an individual's commitment to working with children. Prior to registration each provider, assistant, and alternative provider must complete 15 hours of training plus a minimum of 15 additional hours during the first 6 months of registration for a total of 30 hours during the first year of registration. A total of 30 hours of training must be completed every two years. Training hours must be documented and verifiable.   General Licensing and Facility Requirements     Facility Requirements     The family child care home must meet safety requirements, including electrical outlet covers, window guards or locking devices, a fire extinguisher, smoke detectors, covered radiators and pipes, and a fully equipped first aid kit. Family child care home must have two means of egress, excluding fire escapes.   Inspections     Scheduled inspection by an educational consultant and a fire safety inspector from the NYC Department of Health is required before registration or licensing and for any renewal thereafter. Unannounced inspections may be made at any time and always after a complaint.
