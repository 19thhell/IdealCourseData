The contribution of research to advances in the knowledge base can be directly applied to patient care, and a key component of the education of NYUCD students lies in understanding how research contributes to this knowledge. Further, research as a career option is best demonstrated through the recognition of research as a prominent part of the activity of the faculty.   In addition to the integration of research endeavors in the predoctoral program, there are three research-focused academic programs at NYUCD: MS in Biomaterials , MS in Clinical Research , and MS in Oral Biology.   NYU College of Dentistry has one of the largest and most rapidly growing research programs in the country, and one of the most successful in terms of attracting federal funding. An important part of NYUCD's research strategy is translational research. We firmly believe that in today's world, groups of researchers must work together synergistically in order to move fundamental basic science research into practice. This integrated approach drives the majority of the research conducted today at the NYU College of Dentistry.        Office of Research   The Office of Research provides advice on grant proposals, seeks new sources of funding for research, and counsels faculty and students on research opportunities.

Hochman, Harold Snyder Family Professor of Cardiology. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is designed to facilitate all aspects of patient-based clinical research and education. \u00a0This includes coordination of multicenter trials; support of the infrastructure for clinical research trials; as well as education of faculty, fellows and junior trainees in clinical research methodology. Since its inception, the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center has coordinated dozens of investigator initiated and multicenter cardiovascular clinical research trials at NYU Langone Medical Center and throughout the world.   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center Associate Director is Dr. Harmony Reynolds and Dr. Stuart Katz serves as the Director of Clinical Research Training. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is also comprised of cardiology investigators, grants manager, project managers, research coordinators, and project support staff.\u00a0   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center at NYU School of Medicine encompasses a\u00a0 Clinical Coordinating Center \u00a0which is leading a large international randomized trial, ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches), funded by\u00a0 The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute . The purpose of the ISCHEMIA trial is to determine the best management strategy for higher-risk patients with stable ischemic heart disease. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a target enrollment of ~8000 patients with at least moderate ischemia on stress imaging, from approximately 400 sites. Patients will be assigned at random to a routine invasive strategy (INV) with cardiac catheterization (cath) followed by revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) or to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with cath and revascularization reserved for those who fail OMT.   A multicenter, randomized, international study enrolling patients with stable ischemic heart disease and advanced chronic kidney disease (ISCHEMIA-CKD trial) has also been funded by NHLBI and is directed by Dr. Sripal Bangalore, director of Cath Lab Research. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center\u2019s Clinical Coordinating Center will lead this trial, the largest treatment strategy trial in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease.   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is involved in the conduct of other randomized clinical trials, observational cohort studies and registries of patients with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, as well as percutaneous treatment of valvular heart disease.   The NYU Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center has previously led two international multi-center, randomized clinical trials of a novel pharmacologic agent in cardiogenic shock. In addition, this Center served as the\u00a0 Clinical Coordinating Center \u00a0for another large international multicenter trial, the\u00a0 Occluded Artery Trial (OAT), \u00a0funded by The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute under Dr. Hochman\u2019s direction as Study Chair. \u00a0This was a landmark study which involved 2201 patients and 217 centers worldwide, completed in June 2011. This study specifically looked at whether opening an occluded infarct related artery (IRA) with percutaneous coronary intervention 3 to 28 days after an acute myocardial infarction in high-risk asymptomatic patients would reduce the rate death, MI or hospitalization for class IV heart failure. This trial and the prior NHLBI Dr Hochman led, SHOCK, led to new recommendations in the ACC/AHA and ESC practice guidelines.\u00a0   The CCRC maintains special expertise in heart disease in women, particularly ischemic heart disease without obstructive CAD, a longstanding interest of Drs. Reynolds and Hochman. They previously published a study showing plaque rupture or ulceration in nearly 40% of women with MI without angiographically obstructive CAD. This study was funded by a Doris Duke Charitable Foundation award to Dr. Reynolds. A multi-center follow up study including a larger sample of men and women will launch soon. In addition, patients with moderate-severe ischemia and without obstructive CAD will be evaluated using serial symptom assessment and stress imaging in the multi-center, international CIAO-ISCHEMIA study.\u00a0   \u00a0Drs. Reynolds and Stuart Katz are collaborating with the NYU Dysautonomia Center to investigate the role of autonomic nervous system function in tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition predominantly affects women. In addition, the CCRC offers special expertise in assessment of platelet function and the relationship between platelet function and outcomes via a laboratory directed by Dr. Jeffrey Berger and funded by NHLBI, AHA and the Doris Duke Foundation.   Recent and ongoing studies for which NYU Langone is an enrolling center include NHLBI funded trials such as CABANA, Pyridostigmine in heart failure, FREEDOM, VIRGO, BARI 2D, Reveal, TACT, TOPCAT industry trials such as CoreValve, ABSORB, RENALGUARD, COAPT, FOURIER, REDUCE-IT, MICRA, proMRI, TRILOGY, PROTECT, Tecos, STABILITY, EXCEL, EXSCEL, and EVEREST II, among others.\u00a0   The CCRC also houses the cardiovascular outcomes group led by Dr. Bangalore. The cardiovascular outcomes group is involved in outcomes based clinical research in the areas of hypertension, acute coronary syndromes, stable CAD, lipid disorders, thrombosis and platelet function and heart failure with the use of local, regional, national and international registries and databases. The outcomes group provides study design and statistical analysis support to fellows and faculty.

The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.

The contribution of research to advances in the knowledge base can be directly applied to patient care, and a key component of the education of NYUCD students lies in understanding how research contributes to this knowledge. Further, research as a career option is best demonstrated through the recognition of research as a prominent part of the activity of the faculty.   In addition to the integration of research endeavors in the predoctoral program, there are three research-focused academic programs at NYUCD: MS in Biomaterials , MS in Clinical Research , and MS in Oral Biology.   NYU College of Dentistry has one of the largest and most rapidly growing research programs in the country, and one of the most successful in terms of attracting federal funding. An important part of NYUCD's research strategy is translational research. We firmly believe that in today's world, groups of researchers must work together synergistically in order to move fundamental basic science research into practice. This integrated approach drives the majority of the research conducted today at the NYU College of Dentistry.        Office of Research   The Office of Research provides advice on grant proposals, seeks new sources of funding for research, and counsels faculty and students on research opportunities. The Office of Research oversees the review of research proposals within the college and sponsors small grants for both faculty and student research.

Hochman, Harold Snyder Family Professor of Cardiology. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is designed to facilitate all aspects of patient-based clinical research and education. \u00a0This includes coordination of multicenter trials; support of the infrastructure for clinical research trials; as well as education of faculty, fellows and junior trainees in clinical research methodology. Since its inception, the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center has coordinated dozens of investigator initiated and multicenter cardiovascular clinical research trials at NYU Langone Medical Center and throughout the world.   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center Associate Director is Dr. Harmony Reynolds and Dr. Stuart Katz serves as the Director of Clinical Research Training. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is also comprised of cardiology investigators, grants manager, project managers, research coordinators, and project support staff.\u00a0   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center at NYU School of Medicine encompasses a\u00a0 Clinical Coordinating Center \u00a0which is leading a large international randomized trial, ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches), funded by\u00a0 The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute . The purpose of the ISCHEMIA trial is to determine the best management strategy for higher-risk patients with stable ischemic heart disease. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a target enrollment of ~8000 patients with at least moderate ischemia on stress imaging, from approximately 400 sites. Patients will be assigned at random to a routine invasive strategy (INV) with cardiac catheterization (cath) followed by revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) or to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with cath and revascularization reserved for those who fail OMT.   A multicenter, randomized, international study enrolling patients with stable ischemic heart disease and advanced chronic kidney disease (ISCHEMIA-CKD trial) has also been funded by NHLBI and is directed by Dr. Sripal Bangalore, director of Cath Lab Research. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center\u2019s Clinical Coordinating Center will lead this trial, the largest treatment strategy trial in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease.   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is involved in the conduct of other randomized clinical trials, observational cohort studies and registries of patients with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, as well as percutaneous treatment of valvular heart disease.   The NYU Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center has previously led two international multi-center, randomized clinical trials of a novel pharmacologic agent in cardiogenic shock. In addition, this Center served as the\u00a0 Clinical Coordinating Center \u00a0for another large international multicenter trial, the\u00a0 Occluded Artery Trial (OAT), \u00a0funded by The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute under Dr. Hochman\u2019s direction as Study Chair. \u00a0This was a landmark study which involved 2201 patients and 217 centers worldwide, completed in June 2011. This study specifically looked at whether opening an occluded infarct related artery (IRA) with percutaneous coronary intervention 3 to 28 days after an acute myocardial infarction in high-risk asymptomatic patients would reduce the rate death, MI or hospitalization for class IV heart failure. This trial and the prior NHLBI Dr Hochman led, SHOCK, led to new recommendations in the ACC/AHA and ESC practice guidelines.\u00a0   The CCRC maintains special expertise in heart disease in women, particularly ischemic heart disease without obstructive CAD, a longstanding interest of Drs. Reynolds and Hochman. They previously published a study showing plaque rupture or ulceration in nearly 40% of women with MI without angiographically obstructive CAD. This study was funded by a Doris Duke Charitable Foundation award to Dr. Reynolds. A multi-center follow up study including a larger sample of men and women will launch soon. In addition, patients with moderate-severe ischemia and without obstructive CAD will be evaluated using serial symptom assessment and stress imaging in the multi-center, international CIAO-ISCHEMIA study.\u00a0   \u00a0Drs. Reynolds and Stuart Katz are collaborating with the NYU Dysautonomia Center to investigate the role of autonomic nervous system function in tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition predominantly affects women. In addition, the CCRC offers special expertise in assessment of platelet function and the relationship between platelet function and outcomes via a laboratory directed by Dr. Jeffrey Berger and funded by NHLBI, AHA and the Doris Duke Foundation.   Recent and ongoing studies for which NYU Langone is an enrolling center include NHLBI funded trials such as CABANA, Pyridostigmine in heart failure, FREEDOM, VIRGO, BARI 2D, Reveal, TACT, TOPCAT industry trials such as CoreValve, ABSORB, RENALGUARD, COAPT, FOURIER, REDUCE-IT, MICRA, proMRI, TRILOGY, PROTECT, Tecos, STABILITY, EXCEL, EXSCEL, and EVEREST II, among others.\u00a0   The CCRC also houses the cardiovascular outcomes group led by Dr. Bangalore. The cardiovascular outcomes group is involved in outcomes based clinical research in the areas of hypertension, acute coronary syndromes, stable CAD, lipid disorders, thrombosis and platelet function and heart failure with the use of local, regional, national and international registries and databases. The outcomes group provides study design and statistical analysis support to fellows and faculty.

The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.
