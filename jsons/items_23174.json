The ever growing number of languages feeding into the field  has made it increasingly difficult to keep track of and integrate the  available data and their theoretical implications. While the use of  computers allows searches to be done more quickly than in the past, the  field has not yet made significant use of the internet. This workshop  explored the feasibility of developing a readily usable, open-source  web-based database that will allow researchers 1) access to the  syntactic, semantic and morphological properties of a great number of  the world's languages in the database and 2) opportunities to add new  languages to the database, or to add new data or new generalizations  concerning languages already in the database.   This workshop called together a group of scholars in the fields  of syntax, semantics, morphology and typology as well as experts who  have experience in representing language on the internet to discuss  issues pertaining to the development of such a database. Some of the  questions that we discussed include the following: What syntactic  properties will be included in the initial stage of such a database?  What kinds of computer software and hardware will be needed to  implement such a database? Are there other similar databases right now  on the internet? Is it possible to establish connections to these  projects? What sorts of uses will be made of the database once it is  available online? What kinds of mechanisms can be put in place to  ensure high quality data?   This webpage provides links to the original proposal of the database   and the slides/handouts of our presenters.
