In the 20th century, drawing has also become a medium that exists front and center in the practice of many contemporary artists. While previously it was understood as a preparatory tool, now it is seen as a final destination. The very question of what constitutes drawing has been redefined by artists who have pushed the bounds of the term. This course consider activities in our everyday life that touch on aspects of drawing (writing, diagrammatic language, notation, mapping). We also think about the ways drawing has been taught traditionally, and to consider what associations the medium carries today from this history. The question of what constitutes drawing is approached through process and concept much more than as defined by medium, and the course focuses on an expanded, experimental approach to drawing. Assignments are often a response to a wide variety of artistic mediums where there exist resonant relationships (dance, installation, land art, architecture, sculpture, and performance, among others). Students work in conventional drawing media (pencil, paper, eraser, ink) but also explore how other media can expand the idea of what &quot;drawing&quot; might mean. Although this is a studio course, there is a rigorous reading/research component as well. Texts are assigned for discussion regularly and students do individual presentations to the class based on focused research topics.

Eve Meltzer is Associate Professor of Visual Studies at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study and an affiliated faculty member in the Department of Art History. Her first book, Systems We Have Loved: Conceptual Art, Affect, and the Antihumanist Turn (University of Chicago Press, 2013) situates the conceptual art movement in relation to the field of structuralist thought and offers a new framing for two of the most transformative movements of the 20th century and their common dream of the world as a total sign system. Her second book, tentatively titled Group Photo: The Psycho-Photographic Process and the Making of Group Identity , will explore the proposition that group identity\u2014at least since the invention of photography, if not before\u2014has at its foundation something we might call a psycho-photographic consistency.
