What is the social function of extreme repulsion, and how is it performative? In this course, we will examine several theories of such feelings, and consider how they produce social relations, structures and identities. How and why are particular objects, substances, actions, identities rendered repellent, and what are the political and aesthetic projects that are either enabled or disabled in that process? Readings will be drawn from a range of theoretical approaches (psychoanalytic, anthropological, legal, medical) and students will be encouraged to consider their applicability (or inapplicability) to your own research fields. Requirements: weekly reading responses, student presentations, and a final research paper/project.
