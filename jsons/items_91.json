As part of an unprecedented international partnership between NYU and East China Normal University (ECNU), the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (SMEC), and the Pudong New Area Government, NYU Shanghai is designed to prepare its students for lives of discovery, satisfaction, and contribution in the twenty-first century.     NYU Shanghai students spend at least five semesters in Shanghai and at least one semester elsewhere in NYU's global network. Students study with superb teachers who nurture their capacity for original, rigorous, and critical thinking, and with diverse and intellectually gifted classmates. They pursue a liberal education in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics. They master the skills of cross-cultural effectiveness in a community where half are from China and half are from other lands. They reflect upon the role that great cities play in human progress, and upon the interdependent relationship between China and the rest of the world.

The goal of the conference is to deepen the two schools\u2019 collaboration in social work research and education through the schools\u2019 newly founded Social Work and Social Policy Research Institute.   The gathering is designed to help faculty and administrators of East China Normal University\u2019s School of Social Development and NYU\u2019s Silver School of Social Work to build a collaborative agenda for the Institute\u2019s research and education excellence in the coming years. China holds great potential for expansion of the social work profession, as the Chinese government has embarked on a national initiative to increase its social workers by tenfold during this decade.   Speakers will discuss the current context of social work and related fields in each country, as well the future direction of the profession. Issues that will be examined by speakers and panelists include: mentoring youth and adolescents; marriage and fertility among first-generation families under China\u2019s one-child policy; poverty and social economic development in a global context; and mental health services. The challenge of building up research capacity and collaborative partnerships will also be in focus.   Media coverage is invited.

As part of an unprecedented international partnership between NYU and East China Normal University (ECNU), the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (SMEC), and the Pudong New Area Government, NYU Shanghai is designed to prepare its students for lives of discovery, satisfaction, and contribution in the twenty-first century.     NYU Shanghai students spend at least five semesters in Shanghai and at least one semester elsewhere in NYU's global network. Students study with superb teachers who nurture their capacity for original, rigorous, and critical thinking, and with diverse and intellectually gifted classmates. They pursue a liberal education in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics. They master the skills of cross-cultural effectiveness in a community where half are from China and half are from other lands. They reflect upon the role that great cities play in human progress, and upon the interdependent relationship between China and the rest of the world.

The goal of the conference is to deepen the two schools\u2019 collaboration in social work research and education through the schools\u2019 newly founded Social Work and Social Policy Research Institute.   The gathering is designed to help faculty and administrators of East China Normal University\u2019s School of Social Development and NYU\u2019s Silver School of Social Work to build a collaborative agenda for the Institute\u2019s research and education excellence in the coming years. China holds great potential for expansion of the social work profession, as the Chinese government has embarked on a national initiative to increase its social workers by tenfold during this decade.   Speakers will discuss the current context of social work and related fields in each country, as well the future direction of the profession. Issues that will be examined by speakers and panelists include: mentoring youth and adolescents; marriage and fertility among first-generation families under China\u2019s one-child policy; poverty and social economic development in a global context; and mental health services. The challenge of building up research capacity and collaborative partnerships will also be in focus.   Media coverage is invited.

The study, by the New York University-East China Normal University Institute for Social Development at NYU Shanghai, is the first to develop a descriptive understanding of children\u2019s well-being in contemporary China and examines the two major contexts\u2014family and school\u2014that shape children\u2019s health.   China has the world\u2019s second largest child population at 309 million, accounting for nearly a quarter of the country\u2019s total population.   \u201cGiven the increasing income disparity China faces, our findings can help us understand the factors that nurture or impede a child\u2019s healthy development and hold implications for the future of China\u2019s society,\u201d said Wen-Jui Han , one of the Institute\u2019s directors and a professor at the NYU Silver School of Social Work.   The data were collected through surveys of parents of 2,200 first-grade children in seven school districts in Shanghai, as well as surveys of the children\u2019s teachers and school administrators. The research project serves as the inaugural research endeavor by the Institute, which, founded in 2013, examines issues of poverty and inequality in China and the United States. The same parents will be surveyed in future years, at least until the end of elementary school years, as part of what is a longitudinal study of their children\u2019s health and well-being.   With a few exceptions, researchers found a happy and healthy group of first graders:   \u2022 Boys and children from low-income or rural, hukou status families tended to perform less well in school than the children of urban professionals and have a worse socio-emotional well-being.   \u2022 Seventy percent of children had a normal weight, with 30 percent considered overweight or obese, a rate that is similar to the US based on the most recent report by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children were more likely to be overweight in families with higher family incomes, unlike in the United States.    In general, these children have happily married parents in their mid-thirties who are gainfully employed. The average family annual income ($29,000) places these children in China\u2019s middle class. The survey results suggest that parents are providing a nurturing home environment with high academic expectations.   Children attend large elementary schools averaging about 1,000 students and with highly educated administrators. While schools are seen as having adequate classroom space, libraries, computer rooms, and music rooms, other facilities such as gymnasiums, auditoriums, and multi-purpose rooms were viewed as lacking. In addition, many of these schools are situated in economically mixed neighborhoods dealing with issues that include tensions between local and migrant residents, littered streets, and heavy traffic. Though some shared concerns about their school facilities or neighborhoods, teachers were found to be educated, enthusiastic about their jobs, and have a high degree of career satisfaction.   \u201cThis powerful information provides a contemporary snapshot of these children\u2019s experiences and the first effort of a longitudinal survey that provide us with new insights into children\u2019s well-being in China,\u201d said Jun Wen, an Institute director, professor of sociology and social work at East China Normal University, and the head of ECNU\u2019s Institute of Sociology.

Established in 2013, this partnership aims to create a vibrant and collaborative institute that produces high quality social scientific research as well as scientifically informed research to help shape practice and policy responses that will improve the well-being of both societies. An essential mission of this research institute is to apply both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives to address the issues of poverty and inequality experienced by both societies (China and US) but that manifest in unique ways in each country.
