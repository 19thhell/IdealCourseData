We have made major strides towards fulfilling this mission: our research, clinical, educational, and community services have expanded and grown in new directions. In the face of increased threats to our security and safety, our work has highlighted the importance of strengthening resilience in all children as a preventive strategy to enhance and protect their psychological well-being.   Although our efforts are making a difference, significant challenges remain. Research shows that over 75 percent of mental health disorders have their roots in the childhood and adolescent years, though fewer than one quarter of children or adolescents needing services receive treatment. Millions of children are never properly diagnosed or treated. In the coming year, we will continue to work for increased awareness of child mental health issues, new knowledge, new treatments, and better care to help give children back their childhood.

It is designed for clinicians as well as supervisors and program directors specializing in practice with adolescents.   The program will provide a multicultural perspective inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual identity, and disability. It will also incorporate opportunities for participants to apply new theoretical knowledge and skills to their ongoing clinical practice with adolescents and families.
