One of the four main teaching hospitals of NYU School of Medicine, Tisch is a major training site for students, residents, fellows, and visiting physicians in each of the subspecialties of medicine.     Tisch Hospital was founded in 1882 as the New York Postgraduate Hospital. In 1948 the Postgraduate Hospital merged with New York University Medical Center to form University Hospital. In 1963 University Hospital was rebuilt on its present site, and in 1990 it was renamed Tisch Hospital after one of its prominent and very generous benefactors, Laurence Tisch.     In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy, briefly crippled Tisch Hospital along with other NYU School of Medicine Research and Educational facilities. However, the staff, medical students, physicians, nurses, leadership, and just about everybody pitched in to rebuild. Tisch Hospital re-opened only 2 months after the storm and is going strong.     Today Tisch Hospital is routinely rated among the best general hospitals in the region, offering a wide array of patient-care programs and leading-edge diagnostic and treatment services. The excellence of Tisch is rooted in its large cadre of academic clinicians who combine clinical practice with an intense commitment to teaching and clinical research.     Geriatrics at NYULMC Tisch Hospital      The Geriatric Inpatient Consult Service   The Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care maintains an active multidisciplinary Geriatric Inpatient Consult Service. The Palliative Care multidisciplinary Consult Service , directed by Dr. Joseph Lowy, is even busier. The Geriatrics Inpatient Consult Service directed by Dr. Michael Perskin, Associate Chair of Medicine for Clinical Affairs, and by Ms. Marilyn Lopez, RN, NP, has grown to over 400 consults a year. It is an integral part of the high quality care provided to older adults at Tisch Hospital, making Tisch #10 in the US New and World Report rankings of Geriatric care in American Hospitals. Geriatric fellows, IM House officers, and NYU medical student all rotate on the Geriatrics Inpatient Consult Service (GICS), along with pharmacy and nursing students as well as other learners. Geriatrics faculty members, including experienced voluntary faculty and faculty with strong geriatric consultation backgrounds, share attending responsibilities. This service is supported by an excellent, state of the art, Electronic Medical Records-based (EMR) screening tool that identifies high-risk older adults at hospital admissions. The GICS activities are supported by validated Geriatric Assessment Tools and EMR-based templates that assure comprehensive inpatient evaluation and enhance communication with the patients\u2019 primary physicians and other consulting physicians.      Geriatric Ambulatory Care   The growing ambulatory geriatric practice at NYULMC has several sites conveniently located for older adult patients who can access both primary geriatric care and geriatric ambulatory consultation for cognitive impairment, falls, or preoperative consultations. Three Geriatricians, Dr. Michael Perskin, Dr. Caroline Blaum, and Dr. Anna Zezon, are located within the Internal Medicine Practice on the main Tisch Hospital Campus and are supported by a geriatric nurse practitioner and a highly skilled nursing and administrative staff. Dr. Laleh Mozaen is also located on the Tisch campus, and Dr. Adam Karp maintains an active geriatrics practice at the Hospital for Joint Diseases. In addition, an involved voluntary geriatric practice, which also features social work and physical medicine services, is located nearby on 30th Street. These NYULMC faculty and affiliated physicians are also actively involved in teaching geriatrics to medical students and fellows.     The Medical Service     The Geriatrics Service at Tisch is part of the Department of Internal Medicine, which has many clinical programs at Tisch Hospital. The Medical Service at Tisch handles approximately 8,200 admissions per year, with a high acuity index. Its facilities include 170 acute-care beds, as well as eight Medical Intensive Care Unit beds, six Coronary Care Unit beds, and 16 step-down beds for severely ill patients requiring high acuity care but not ICU admission. The service also comprises an acute cardiac unit for patients who require specialized cardiac care, and a hematology/oncology unit for patients with a wide range of hematologic diseases and malignancies.     A Hospitalist Program, staffed by full-time academic hospitalists, was started at Tisch in 2004 to provide optimal patient care as well as to facilitate clinical research in such areas as health outcomes and medical informatics.     The educational programs at Tisch run the gamut from undergraduate instruction to advanced fellowship training. Ten third-year students and four to eight fourth-year students (subinterns) train in the Medical Service at Tisch every month, while approximately 20 house staff rotate through the service and its intensive care units and subspecialty services. Clinical fellows in each division of the Department of Medicine provide consultative services at Tisch under the guidance of subspecialty attending physicians.

These two programs were brought together in the Bellevue Hospital Geriatric Clinic when a new Section of Geriatrics was established in 1979 within the Department of Medicine.   Over the next twenty years, Geriatrics clinical and educational programs developed rapidly. The Bellevue Geriatrics clinic grew, and was followed by a Geriatrics clinic at the VA, as well as the Home Based Primary Care Program at the Manhattan VA Hospital. A Tisch Hospital Geriatrics Service has evolved into an active inpatient multidisciplinary Geriatrics Consult Service at the Tisch University Hospital. Over the years, several nursing homes have been part of the Geriatrics Program at NYULMC. Currently, Gouverneur Health Center is the site of sub-acute and long-term care clinical and educational activities for the Division.   A Geriatric Fellowship Program was started in 1981, and was one of the first ten geriatric fellowships in the United States. Our fellowship has six fellows for the accredited 1-year Fellowship, with an optional 2nd year for a research concentration. Geriatric fellows rotate through all three medical centers, NYULMC Tisch Hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center and the Manhattan VA, and through the Gouverneur Health Center.   The NYULMC Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care has long-standing and close relationships with NYULMC Neurosciences and Alzheimer\u2019s Programs, Geriatric Psychiatry, Geriatric Nursing and the new Department of Population Health at NYULMC. With such strengths and collaborations, the NYU Geriatric Fellowship Program is becoming recognized as one of the best Geriatric Fellowships in the nation.

These two programs were brought together in the Bellevue Hospital Geriatric Clinic when a new Section of Geriatrics was established in 1979 within the Department of Medicine.   Over the next twenty years, Geriatrics clinical and educational programs developed rapidly. The Bellevue Geriatrics clinic grew, and was followed by a Geriatrics clinic at the VA, as well as the Home Based Primary Care Program at the Manhattan VA Hospital. A Tisch Hospital Geriatrics Service has evolved into an active inpatient multidisciplinary Geriatrics Consult Service at the Tisch University Hospital. Over the years, several nursing homes have been part of the Geriatrics Program at NYULMC. Currently, Gouverneur Health Center is the site of sub-acute and long-term care clinical and educational activities for the Division.   A Geriatric Fellowship Program was started in 1981, and was one of the first ten geriatric fellowships in the United States. Our fellowship has six fellows for the accredited 1-year Fellowship, with an optional 2nd year for a research concentration. Geriatric fellows rotate through all three medical centers, NYULMC Tisch Hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center and the Manhattan VA, and through the Gouverneur Health Center.   The NYULMC Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care has long-standing and close relationships with NYULMC Neurosciences and Alzheimer\u2019s Programs, Geriatric Psychiatry, Geriatric Nursing and the new Department of Population Health at NYULMC. With such strengths and collaborations, the NYU Geriatric Fellowship Program is becoming recognized as one of the best Geriatric Fellowships in the nation.

One of the four main teaching hospitals of NYU School of Medicine, Tisch is a major training site for students, residents, fellows, and visiting physicians in each of the subspecialties of medicine.     Tisch Hospital was founded in 1882 as the New York Postgraduate Hospital. In 1948 the Postgraduate Hospital merged with New York University Medical Center to form University Hospital. In 1963 University Hospital was rebuilt on its present site, and in 1990 it was renamed Tisch Hospital after one of its prominent and very generous benefactors, Laurence Tisch.     In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy, briefly crippled Tisch Hospital along with other NYU School of Medicine Research and Educational facilities. However, the staff, medical students, physicians, nurses, leadership, and just about everybody pitched in to rebuild. Tisch Hospital re-opened only 2 months after the storm and is going strong.     Today Tisch Hospital is routinely rated among the best general hospitals in the region, offering a wide array of patient-care programs and leading-edge diagnostic and treatment services. The excellence of Tisch is rooted in its large cadre of academic clinicians who combine clinical practice with an intense commitment to teaching and clinical research.     Geriatrics at NYULMC Tisch Hospital      The Geriatric Inpatient Consult Service   The Division of Geriatric Medicine and Palliative Care maintains an active multidisciplinary Geriatric Inpatient Consult Service. The Palliative Care multidisciplinary Consult Service , directed by Dr. Joseph Lowy, is even busier. The Geriatrics Inpatient Consult Service directed by Dr. Michael Perskin, Associate Chair of Medicine for Clinical Affairs, and by Ms. Marilyn Lopez, RN, NP, has grown to over 400 consults a year. It is an integral part of the high quality care provided to older adults at Tisch Hospital, making Tisch #10 in the US New and World Report rankings of Geriatric care in American Hospitals. Geriatric fellows, IM House officers, and NYU medical student all rotate on the Geriatrics Inpatient Consult Service (GICS), along with pharmacy and nursing students as well as other learners. Geriatrics faculty members, including experienced voluntary faculty and faculty with strong geriatric consultation backgrounds, share attending responsibilities. This service is supported by an excellent, state of the art, Electronic Medical Records-based (EMR) screening tool that identifies high-risk older adults at hospital admissions. The GICS activities are supported by validated Geriatric Assessment Tools and EMR-based templates that assure comprehensive inpatient evaluation and enhance communication with the patients\u2019 primary physicians and other consulting physicians.      Geriatric Ambulatory Care   The growing ambulatory geriatric practice at NYULMC has several sites conveniently located for older adult patients who can access both primary geriatric care and geriatric ambulatory consultation for cognitive impairment, falls, or preoperative consultations. Three Geriatricians, Dr. Michael Perskin, Dr. Caroline Blaum, and Dr. Anna Zezon, are located within the Internal Medicine Practice on the main Tisch Hospital Campus and are supported by a geriatric nurse practitioner and a highly skilled nursing and administrative staff. Dr. Laleh Mozaen is also located on the Tisch campus, and Dr. Adam Karp maintains an active geriatrics practice at the Hospital for Joint Diseases. In addition, an involved voluntary geriatric practice, which also features social work and physical medicine services, is located nearby on 30th Street. These NYULMC faculty and affiliated physicians are also actively involved in teaching geriatrics to medical students and fellows.     The Medical Service     The Geriatrics Service at Tisch is part of the Department of Internal Medicine, which has many clinical programs at Tisch Hospital. The Medical Service at Tisch handles approximately 8,200 admissions per year, with a high acuity index. Its facilities include 170 acute-care beds, as well as eight Medical Intensive Care Unit beds, six Coronary Care Unit beds, and 16 step-down beds for severely ill patients requiring high acuity care but not ICU admission. The service also comprises an acute cardiac unit for patients who require specialized cardiac care, and a hematology/oncology unit for patients with a wide range of hematologic diseases and malignancies.     A Hospitalist Program, staffed by full-time academic hospitalists, was started at Tisch in 2004 to provide optimal patient care as well as to facilitate clinical research in such areas as health outcomes and medical informatics.     The educational programs at Tisch run the gamut from undergraduate instruction to advanced fellowship training. Ten third-year students and four to eight fourth-year students (subinterns) train in the Medical Service at Tisch every month, while approximately 20 house staff rotate through the service and its intensive care units and subspecialty services. Clinical fellows in each division of the Department of Medicine provide consultative services at Tisch under the guidance of subspecialty attending physicians.
