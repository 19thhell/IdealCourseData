There is a version in Microsoft Word (.doc) format , and a LaTeX version that can be used with the courantletterhead package available on CIMS Linux systems.    Here's an example of how to create a PDF with the LaTeX version:    mkdir ~/latextest    cp /usr/local/share/texmf-local/doc/latex/sample-new.tex ~/latextest/    cd ~/latextest    vim sample-new.tex (modify this file to contain the desired information)    pdflatex sample-new.tex         On-site Intel Cluster Tools Seminar          Update: Moved to WWH 201    An Intel engineer with the Intel Cluster Tools Suite will be giving an on-site seminar in regards to their clustering software suite. CIMS as well as the NYU community (HPC, etc) are invited. CIMS users have access to these tools by running 'module load intel64', and the tools are located in '/opt/intel'.       Location: WWH 201    Date: Tuesday, April 30th from 1:15pm - 3:15pm    Topics:    - MPI Performance Options    - Analysis tools    - MKL (may be rescheduled for separate seminar if sufficient interest)       Space is limited, so please RSVP to guarantee yourself a seat ( login with your NYU NetID ).    More documentation in regards to the Intel Cluster Suite are available from the Intel Website .         Window Virtual Lab Expansion          Due to increasing usage of the Windows Virtual Lab (Windows on Linux) service, several users have run into the situation where a VM wasn't available for use. We've added new nodes to the virtual pool of available machines to address the issue. Thank you for being patient with our continued expansion of this service. If you continue to run into any problems, please let us know at helpdesk@cims.nyu.edu.         New Software: COMSOL          COMSOL is now available from all the CIMS Linux machines (compute nodes and desktops).    The COMSOL Multiphysics simulation environment facilitates all the steps in the modeling process &ndash; defining your geometry, meshing, specifying your physics, solving, and then visualizing your results.    Simply run ' comsol ' from a command line interface.         Visit Update          The VisIt visualization software has been updated. If you experience problems with it, please let us know . You can also run the last version by running ' visit-last' .         Free On Campus Matlab Seminars          Free on campus Matlab seminars on Thursday, March 7th @ NYU&rsquo;s Kimmel Center, Room 802 (Shorin Studio). Session 1 (10am-12pm): Mathematical Modeling with MATLAB Mathematical models are critical to understanding and accurately simulating the behavior of complex systems. They enable important tasks such as forecasting system behavior for various &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios, characterizing system response, and designing control systems. This session will show how you can use MATLAB products for mathematical modeling tasks, including: &bull;    Developing models using data fitting and first-principle modeling techniques &bull;    Optimizing the accuracy of mathematical models &bull;    Simulating models and post-processing the results &bull;    Documenting and sharing models  You will also learn about different approaches you can use to develop models, including developing models programmatically using the MATLAB language, deriving closed-form analytical equations using symbolic computation, and leveraging prebuilt graphical tools for specific modeling tasks such as curve and surface fitting. Session 2 (2pm-4pm): Parallel Computing with MATLAB In this session, you will learn how to solve computationally and data-intensive problems using multicore processors, GPUs, and computer clusters. We will introduce you to high-level programming constructs that allow you to parallelize MATLAB applications without CUDA or MPI programming and run them on multiple processors. We will also show you how to overcome the memory limits of your desktop computer and solve problems that require manipulating very large matrices by distributing your data.  Highlights include: &bull;  Toolboxes with built-in support for parallel computing &bull;  Creating parallel applications to speed up independent tasks &bull;  Programming with distributed arrays to work with large data sets &bull;  Scaling up to computer clusters, grid environments, or clouds &bull;  Tips on developing parallel algorithms ** These technical seminars are FREE for all NYU faculty, staff, researcher and students. ** Please contact rheather.wellman at mathworks dot com with any questions.         Default Python Downgrade          The default version of Python installed on the Courant systems was recently switched to Python-2.7. This was causing many system problems. As a result, the system default version of python has been reverted to Python-2.6. Never fear however, you can still use Python-2.7 as your default. Before using python simply run the following from a command line:    module load python-2.7    For a list of other available modules and software versions available, run:    module avail             If you have any problems, please notify helpdesk@cims.nyu.edu                  New Courant Community Wiki          A new Courant community driven wiki is now up and running on NYU's WikiSpaces .    This wiki exists to allow members of the CIMS community to provide any content that they think could be useful to fellow community members. Consider posting any of the following (or whatever else you think people may want to know about):       Have a tip about using the computer systems at Courant? Post it!    Have a favorite place to eat nearby? Post it!    Know when/where CIMS people go to socialize? Post it!    Have an unofficial group that gets together regularly or want to start one? Post it!    Know about some great entertainment in the neighborhood? Post it!       Enjoy!         Maple Upgrade             The Maple software has been upgraded to the latest version. No changes should be necessary on the user end. Just run 'xmaple' from the command line to run it.    If you have any problems, please notify helpdesk@cims.nyu.edu            Last Login Information          CIMS users can now get a list of their most recent terminal logins from the CIMS Portal .

Session 1 (10am-12pm): Mathematical Modeling with MATLAB Mathematical models are critical to understanding and accurately simulating the behavior of complex systems. They enable important tasks such as forecasting system behavior for various &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios, characterizing system response, and designing control systems. This session will show how you can use MATLAB products for mathematical modeling tasks, including: &bull;    Developing models using data fitting and first-principle modeling techniques &bull;    Optimizing the accuracy of mathematical models &bull;    Simulating models and post-processing the results &bull;    Documenting and sharing models  You will also learn about different approaches you can use to develop models, including developing models programmatically using the MATLAB language, deriving closed-form analytical equations using symbolic computation, and leveraging prebuilt graphical tools for specific modeling tasks such as curve and surface fitting. Session 2 (2pm-4pm): Parallel Computing with MATLAB In this session, you will learn how to solve computationally and data-intensive problems using multicore processors, GPUs, and computer clusters. We will introduce you to high-level programming constructs that allow you to parallelize MATLAB applications without CUDA or MPI programming and run them on multiple processors. We will also show you how to overcome the memory limits of your desktop computer and solve problems that require manipulating very large matrices by distributing your data.  Highlights include: &bull;  Toolboxes with built-in support for parallel computing &bull;  Creating parallel applications to speed up independent tasks &bull;  Programming with distributed arrays to work with large data sets &bull;  Scaling up to computer clusters, grid environments, or clouds &bull;  Tips on developing parallel algorithms ** These technical seminars are FREE for all NYU faculty, staff, researcher and students. ** Please contact rheather.wellman at mathworks dot com with any questions.         Default Python Downgrade          The default version of Python installed on the Courant systems was recently switched to Python-2.7. This was causing many system problems.

Congratulations!              &lt;&lt;More News&gt;&gt;                    Learning and modeling the circuits that operate life: The Bonneau lab aims to learn large biological networks directly from genomics data (genomics =3D very scalable biology experiments). Our recent work, as part of collaborative teams of systems biologists and  computational biologists, has recently resulted in genome-wide models that are capable of simulating the functioning of the genome in real time (Bonneau, et. al, 2006, Cell). Dr. Bonneau's lab develops new algorithms that attempt to learn the regulatory networks (their topology and dynamical parameters) that are at the core of biological systems. This work was featured in a 2008 Discover Article, where Dr. Bonneau was selected as one of the top 20 scientists under 40. This work is collaborative work that relies on NYU's local expertise in Machine Learning, Modeling complex systems and their dynamics, and Genomics.  Links:   Bonneau Lab     With Ph.D. student Eugene Weinstein and Google researcher Pedro Moreno, Mehryar Mohri is working on audio fingerprinting techniques that enable computers to recognize songs. This work represents songs in terms of \"music phonemes\", elementary units of music sound that are learned from data, and uses weighted finite-state transducers to construct a compact and efficient index of a large database of songs. The image depicts an example of such a transducer. As a result, songs can be recognized quickly and accurately when only a recording of a short \"audio snippet\" is available and even when the recording is distorted. The group has created a working system with a database of 15,000 songs. Moreover, it has proven new bounds on the size of the indexing finite automata used that guarantee the compactness of this representation as the number of songs indexed increases and suggests that their techniques scale to much larger song data sets.

Congratulations!              &lt;&lt;More News&gt;&gt;                    Learning and modeling the circuits that operate life: The Bonneau lab aims to learn large biological networks directly from genomics data (genomics =3D very scalable biology experiments). Our recent work, as part of collaborative teams of systems biologists and  computational biologists, has recently resulted in genome-wide models that are capable of simulating the functioning of the genome in real time (Bonneau, et. al, 2006, Cell). Dr. Bonneau's lab develops new algorithms that attempt to learn the regulatory networks (their topology and dynamical parameters) that are at the core of biological systems. This work was featured in a 2008 Discover Article, where Dr. Bonneau was selected as one of the top 20 scientists under 40. This work is collaborative work that relies on NYU's local expertise in Machine Learning, Modeling complex systems and their dynamics, and Genomics.  Links:   Bonneau Lab     With Ph.D. student Eugene Weinstein and Google researcher Pedro Moreno, Mehryar Mohri is working on audio fingerprinting techniques that enable computers to recognize songs. This work represents songs in terms of \"music phonemes\", elementary units of music sound that are learned from data, and uses weighted finite-state transducers to construct a compact and efficient index of a large database of songs. The image depicts an example of such a transducer. As a result, songs can be recognized quickly and accurately when only a recording of a short \"audio snippet\" is available and even when the recording is distorted. The group has created a working system with a database of 15,000 songs. Moreover, it has proven new bounds on the size of the indexing finite automata used that guarantee the compactness of this representation as the number of songs indexed increases and suggests that their techniques scale to much larger song data sets.
