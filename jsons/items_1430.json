In addition, applicants for the Ph.D. program   in English and American literature must also submit a writing sample   (10-12 pages). Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Test Score(s). General Test Scores are required. Taking the GRE Subject Test in Literature is recommended but not required. The department considers applications for the Ph.D. program in English and American literature for fall admission only. Applicants whose native language is not English must submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) results unless they have received their undergraduate degree from an accredited American college or university or from a college or university where the language of instruction is English. Near-native fluency in English is crucial for successful completion of all the programs offered by the department. All application materials and supporting documents must be submitted on-line through Graduate Enrollment Services (see the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid for instructions). Applications submitted directly to the department are not considered. The department withdraws from consideration all applications that are missing supporting documents one month after the posted deadline. Requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy degree in English and American literature include the completion of 72 points and the following specific course requirements: Four doctoral seminars (selected from ENGL-GA 3100 through ENGL-GA 3969). Guided Research, ENGL-GA 3002, in preparation for Doctoral Examination. Dissertation Seminar I, ENGL-GA 3981, in preparation for submission of the dissertation proposal. Dissertation Seminar II, ENGL-GA 3982, consisting of oral defense of the Dissertation Proposal and beginning of writing and research of dissertation. Pedagogy, ENGL-GA 3985, taken during the first semester in which teaching is anticipated. Workshop on Professional Practices, ENGL-GA 3980, which must be taken in the student's fourth year in the program. Students must also pass the Doctoral Examination, based on two individualized reading lists covering two historical fields (one of which is designated the major field, and the other the minor field). The examination fields are: medieval; Renaissance; 18th-century British; Romantic; 19th-century British; 20th-century British; American: beginning to 1865; American: 1865 to present; African American literature; colonial and postcolonial studies; literature of the Americas; transatlantic studies; and modern drama. The written examination is supervised by a committee of two faculty members chosen by the student. Students must also demonstrate language proficiency beyond the English language. This requirement may be satisfied either before or after matriculation at NYU by demonstrating either (a) advanced proficiency in one language by completing the sixth term of an acceptable college language course with a grade of B or better or by passing a language examination at a comparable level of proficiency or (b) proficiency in two languages by completing the equivalent of four semesters of acceptable college work. The final course or examination establishing proficiency must have been completed no more than two years prior to matriculation for the Ph.D. program. The language(s) offered must be relevant to the dissertation research and scholarly practice of the field in which the student intends to work, and the department reserves the right to require a particular language on these grounds. Any student whose first language is not English should see the director of graduate studies to discuss the use of that language to fulfill (or partially fulfill) the requirement. The final requirement is a completed dissertation and an oral defense of the dissertation. The dissertation must be approved for defense by the director and core committee before the examination is convened. Some revision, including the mandatory correction of any errors, may be required as a result of the defense. The examining board consists of five members of the graduate faculty, the core committee plus two additional committee members. In this final examination, the candidate is questioned for one hour on the dissertation. If the candidate fails the oral defense of the dissertation, a second examination is permitted, resulting either in a pass or in elimination from the Ph.D. program.

Students entering with an M.A. degree in a national literature must show 40 points in comparative literature upon the completion of course requirements for the Ph.D. degree. In addition to the M.A. requirements, the Ph.D. requires an additional 40 points of coursework, 20 points in Comparative Literature, including the required Thesis Research, COLIT-GA 3991 and 20 points outside of the department. Students must also prove proficiency in a fourth language, or\u2014substituting for the fourth language\u2014three courses in a nonliterary discipline. Once course work and language proficiency has been satisfied, students are required to pass a comprehensive exam. This Ph.D. examination consists of a comprehensive, written take-home examination on three topics chosen by the candidate, in consultation with a faculty committee: one topic is literary criticism and theory, a second topic includes the candidate's major or teaching field, and the third is in a nodal field of critical, historical, generic, or period interest. The written examination is taken after the required Thesis Research course in which the topics for the exam are prepared. The written examination is followed within the next semester by an oral examination given by the same faculty committee of three, on the preliminary dissertation prospectus prepared by the candidate. The revised prospectus is then submitted, usually within six weeks, for final approval by its three readers. Following the exams, doctoral candidates should be prepared to write a thesis which must be concerned with comparative issues of language, discipline, or culture.

In addition, applicants for the Ph.D. program   in English and American literature must also submit a writing sample   (10-12 pages). Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Test Score(s). General Test Scores are required. Taking the GRE Subject Test in Literature is recommended but not required. The department considers applications for the Ph.D. program in English and American literature for fall admission only. Applicants whose native language is not English must submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) results unless they have received their undergraduate degree from an accredited American college or university or from a college or university where the language of instruction is English. Near-native fluency in English is crucial for successful completion of all the programs offered by the department. All application materials and supporting documents must be submitted on-line through Graduate Enrollment Services (see the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid for instructions). Applications submitted directly to the department are not considered. The department withdraws from consideration all applications that are missing supporting documents one month after the posted deadline. Requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy degree in English and American literature include the completion of 72 points and the following specific course requirements: Four doctoral seminars (selected from ENGL-GA 3100 through ENGL-GA 3969). Guided Research, ENGL-GA 3002, in preparation for Doctoral Examination. Dissertation Seminar I, ENGL-GA 3981, in preparation for submission of the dissertation proposal. Dissertation Seminar II, ENGL-GA 3982, consisting of oral defense of the Dissertation Proposal and beginning of writing and research of dissertation. Pedagogy, ENGL-GA 3985, taken during the first semester in which teaching is anticipated. Workshop on Professional Practices, ENGL-GA 3980, which must be taken in the student's fourth year in the program. Students must also pass the Doctoral Examination, based on two individualized reading lists covering two historical fields (one of which is designated the major field, and the other the minor field). The examination fields are: medieval; Renaissance; 18th-century British; Romantic; 19th-century British; 20th-century British; American: beginning to 1865; American: 1865 to present; African American literature; colonial and postcolonial studies; literature of the Americas; transatlantic studies; and modern drama. The written examination is supervised by a committee of two faculty members chosen by the student. Students must also demonstrate language proficiency beyond the English language. This requirement may be satisfied either before or after matriculation at NYU by demonstrating either (a) advanced proficiency in one language by completing the sixth term of an acceptable college language course with a grade of B or better or by passing a language examination at a comparable level of proficiency or (b) proficiency in two languages by completing the equivalent of four semesters of acceptable college work. The final course or examination establishing proficiency must have been completed no more than two years prior to matriculation for the Ph.D. program. The language(s) offered must be relevant to the dissertation research and scholarly practice of the field in which the student intends to work, and the department reserves the right to require a particular language on these grounds. Any student whose first language is not English should see the director of graduate studies to discuss the use of that language to fulfill (or partially fulfill) the requirement. The final requirement is a completed dissertation and an oral defense of the dissertation. The dissertation must be approved for defense by the director and core committee before the examination is convened. Some revision, including the mandatory correction of any errors, may be required as a result of the defense. The examining board consists of five members of the graduate faculty, the core committee plus two additional committee members. In this final examination, the candidate is questioned for one hour on the dissertation. If the candidate fails the oral defense of the dissertation, a second examination is permitted, resulting either in a pass or in elimination from the Ph.D. program.

Students entering with an M.A. degree in a national literature must show 40 points in comparative literature upon the completion of course requirements for the Ph.D. degree. In addition to the M.A. requirements, the Ph.D. requires an additional 40 points of coursework, 20 points in Comparative Literature, including the required Thesis Research, COLIT-GA 3991 and 20 points outside of the department. Students must also prove proficiency in a fourth language, or\u2014substituting for the fourth language\u2014three courses in a nonliterary discipline. Once course work and language proficiency has been satisfied, students are required to pass a comprehensive exam. This Ph.D. examination consists of a comprehensive, written take-home examination on three topics chosen by the candidate, in consultation with a faculty committee: one topic is literary criticism and theory, a second topic includes the candidate's major or teaching field, and the third is in a nodal field of critical, historical, generic, or period interest. The written examination is taken after the required Thesis Research course in which the topics for the exam are prepared. The written examination is followed within the next semester by an oral examination given by the same faculty committee of three, on the preliminary dissertation prospectus prepared by the candidate. The revised prospectus is then submitted, usually within six weeks, for final approval by its three readers. Following the exams, doctoral candidates should be prepared to write a thesis which must be concerned with comparative issues of language, discipline, or culture. The Ph.D. thesis must be approved by an adviser and two major readers; after completion and acceptance of the thesis, two further readers are invited to complete the oral defense jury.
