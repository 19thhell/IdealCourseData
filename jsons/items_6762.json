We offer classes, workshops, retreats and study  groups in which we study the works of psychoanalysts, philosophers and  contemplative masters from Eastern and Western traditions. Our intention is to  enrich intellectual understanding and experiential knowledge of these  disciplines, which are devoted to alleviating psychic suffering and the art of  transformation. All of our programs have an experiential component. Using  various forms of meditation, and a contemplative, meditative style of  reading texts, watching films and exploring art, we seek to encourage a  savoring of experience and a deepening of awareness. From year to year,  our topics have varied from attachment to death, from psychosis to mental  health, from quantum mechanics to ancient sutras, from Bion to Thomas  Merton, from the Kabbalah to Buddhism.      Eligibility: All courses and study groups are open to psychoanalysts,  psychotherapists, other mental health clinicians and students in the mental  health field.      Committee: Sara  L.

Time:   Eight  Wednesdays,      September 24-November  12, 2013      1-2:30pm      Place: 255 West 85th Street  Suite 1D, New York            \u201cHow to listen?\u201d   \u201cWhat to listen for?\u201d                 These will be the  pivotal questions that we will engage with in this class both experientially  and theoretically.      The approach to these  complex questions will be primarily contemplative. Each class will begin with  a guided sitting meditation. Our goal is to cultivate and support the  participants, whether new or experienced meditators, in the practice of  availing themselves to listening as fully possible. Following our meditation  practice, we proceed, mindfully to follow our listening into psychoanalytic and  contemplative readings and clinical material from participants and  instructor. We will study the resonance and the affinities among  Buddhist concepts such as \u201cImpermanence\u201d, \u201cNo-self\u201d, \u201cDukkha (non-fulfillment)\u201d  \u201cEmptiness\u201d, and \u201cInterbeing\u201d with psychoanalytic concepts such as  \u201cattachment\u201d, \u201cIdentification\u201d, and \u201dMultiplicity of self.\u201d   How does our contemplative listening enrich and expand our understanding  of the relations among these concepts?                Readings from the  psychoanalytic and contemplative literature will be offered as we interweave  mindful practice with clinical work.       The goal of the  group is to form a supportive and safe container for sustaining each  participant's ongoing mindful listening practice and to enrich our clinical  work.            Ron Balamuth,  Ph.D. is  a Clinical Psychologist-Psychoanalyst, graduate of the New York University  Post Doctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis. He has been  involved in meditation practice in various traditions for the past  30 years. He is faculty and supervisor at the William Alanson  White Institute Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy Training Program,  Columbia University and NIP. He is in private practice in New  York City, where he consults with individuals, couples, families and  children. He also leads study groups and case consultations  for professionals.

R. Bion described containment as a  process in which there was a boundaried mental space in which thoughts could be  born. As psychoanalysts and psychotherapists we must develop with  patients containing processes for being-states, dream communications, and pieces  of mind that have not yet been embodied or thought. How do we make room,  with our minds-in-bodies-in-space, for those fragments to find a form?            In this workshop, we begin with a demonstration of  the application of Authentic Movement practice to clinical material.   Authentic Movement is a simple meditative movement practice in which one  alternately takes the role of mover and witness. In the role of the mover one  closes ones eyes and allows ones self to move according to a natural direction.  The witness keeps eyes open and notices their somato-sensory experience of the  other\u2019s movement. Each participant will be invited to explore both roles\u2014  mover and witness, container and contained, in order to experience how  Authentic movement supports and enriches participation in the containing  process with patients. Participants will be guided to consider a clinical  moment using the Authentic Movement structure, thus discovering what arises  when the moment is expanded into movement, as either as witness or mover.            Deborah Sherman,  BC-DMT, LMHC is  a practicing Psychoanalyst and Dance/Movement Therapist. She is on the  faculty of the Institute for the Psychoanalytic Study of Subjectivity (IPSS)  and the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy (ICP) in New York City and is  a supervisor for the Psychotherapy Center for Gender and Sexuality at ICP. Deborah has been participating in an  Authentic Movement group for the past 25 years and has been studying (and  contemplating) W.R. Bion's work for the last 8.

This course will  present the foundations of Jon Kabat-Zinn's widely respected Mindfulness-Based  Stress Reduction (MBSR) program. It will include basic instruction in various  methods of mindfulness meditation, and guidance in how to make these practices  a meaningful part of one's life. In addition, specific attention will be paid  to how participants can most usefully bring the basic spirit and approach of  mindfulness into their lives, and work, as therapists and mental health  professionals. The course is experiential, but ample time will be allotted to  discuss each participant's experience of his/her meditation practice, and to  discuss also the relationship of the meditation practice to clinical work.

The goal of the class will be to engage participants  in their own writing that is alive and creative and that integrates both the  contemplative and psychoanalytic dimensions of our work with patients. A  significant portion of all 8 meetings will involve participants in the process  of writing, led by guided exercises.            Therese  Ragen, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist-psychoanalyst, a graduate and faculty  member of the NYU postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. Her  book, \u201cThe Consulting Room and Beyond: Psychoanalytic Work and its  Reverberations in the Analyst\u2019s Life\u201d was published by Routledge in 2008.

We will do this through a series of guided meditations and  contemplations, and through a series of processes based on the work of  Charlotte Selver, that explore somatic and sensory experience.            Charlotte  Selver was a leading figure in the early human potential movement and the  introduction of Zen Buddhism to this country. Her work with D.T. Suzuki  and Erich Fromm in the 1950 \u2019s began a  dialogue in this country between the disciplines of Psychoanalysis and  Buddhism.            These meditations and sensory  awareness exercises will allow us to become more fully present to our  moment-to-moment experience in and out of the consulting room, increasing our  awareness of shifts in somato-sensory experience\u2014our own and our patient\u2019s.   Further, we will explore forms of embodied supervision and embodied dream  work.                  Sue A. Shapiro,  Ph.D.,   is a clinical consultant at NYU Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and  Psychoanalysis. She is the Founder and Director Emeritus of the  Trauma Center, at Manhattan Institute for Psychoanalysis. She is the  author of one of the first papers on embodiment and psychoanalysis, \u201cThe  embodied analyst in the Victorian Consulting Room\u201d (Gender and Psychoanalysis  1996). In parallel with her psychoanalytic training and practice  over the last 35 years she has studied various forms of somatic work including  sensory awareness, polarity, therapeutic touch, kinetic awareness, holotropic  breath work, and somatic experience. She is one of the founding members  of the Contemplative Studies Project at NYU.

Consideration of arising group experience and  ongoing case material offers a more first-hand realization of Bion's at times  knotty writing. Links to other Bion writings and to secondary  sources--psychoanalytic, philosophical and otherwise--are explored for  clarification and background support.

Resumes  this year on September 19 th , 2014            This study and  meditation group supports members\u2019 meditation practice and approaches Eastern  and Western psychologies through contemplative reading and discussion. In this  group we explore how clinical work is enhanced by the embodied intelligence  generated by meditation. This Fall we will focus on trauma and how it is  understood psychoanalytically, while contemplating and practicing  Bodhichitta, and Buddhist teachings that address the shock of trauma.   Past years\u2019 topics included a close reading of the The Heart  Sutra, The Four Foundations of Mindfulness, which is the original teaching  by Shakyamuni Buddha on meditation, attachment theory and the Buddhist view of  non-atttachment, and Bodhichitta or awakened heart and it\u2019s effects on personal  and interpersonal transformation. This group is open to all mental health  professionals and graduate students interested in combining the study of  meditation and psychoanalysis.

The goal of the class will be to engage participants  in their own writing that is alive and creative and that integrates both the  contemplative and psychoanalytic dimensions of our work with patients.

Therese  Ragen, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist-psychoanalyst, a graduate and faculty  member of the NYU postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.

We will do this through a series of guided meditations and  contemplations, and through a series of processes based on the work of  Charlotte Selver, that explore somatic and sensory experience.            Charlotte  Selver was a leading figure in the early human potential movement and the  introduction of Zen Buddhism to this country. Her work with D.T. Suzuki  and Erich Fromm in the 1950 \u2019s began a  dialogue in this country between the disciplines of Psychoanalysis and  Buddhism.            These meditations and sensory  awareness exercises will allow us to become more fully present to our  moment-to-moment experience in and out of the consulting room, increasing our  awareness of shifts in somato-sensory experience\u2014our own and our patient\u2019s.   Further, we will explore forms of embodied supervision and embodied dream  work.                  Sue A.

She is the Founder and Director Emeritus of the  Trauma Center, at Manhattan Institute for Psychoanalysis.

In this  group we explore how clinical work is enhanced by the embodied intelligence  generated by meditation. This Fall we will focus on trauma and how it is  understood psychoanalytically, while contemplating and practicing  Bodhichitta, and Buddhist teachings that address the shock of trauma.   Past years\u2019 topics included a close reading of the The Heart  Sutra, The Four Foundations of Mindfulness, which is the original teaching  by Shakyamuni Buddha on meditation, attachment theory and the Buddhist view of  non-atttachment, and Bodhichitta or awakened heart and it\u2019s effects on personal  and interpersonal transformation.
