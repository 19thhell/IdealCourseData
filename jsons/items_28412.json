[{"detail": [{"content": "There are five senses that we are born with           Heightened Sensory Perception   by Julia Schneider   N.B.   This document contains attached audio file on a nature walk      We have lost the drive to discover or remember the importance of our natural   world. In our American Society at the turn of this century in the year two thousand,   true regard for what the natural world provides us is being lost and replaced   by fast paced, technology driven stimuli. It is the constant pressure of keeping   up with and as much as one knows about computers and cell phones, one knows   very little about himself. The process of reawakening the senses, by experiencing   the natural world leads to an awareness and perception of oneself that enriches   ones life. In order for a person to increase their sensitivity to their other   senses, one should experience the natural world by submerging or engaging in   it by hiking, biking, camping, white water rafting, etc. If we can focus more   energy on improving this area, naturally, our senses will begin to reawaken,   allowing us to gain better control over our lives. There are several different   vocations which demonstrate the positive effects of such exposure and learning   and the results prove worthwhile, specifically looking at the efforts taken   by educators, organizations, volunteers and spiritual leaders who are dedicated   to opening the minds of our youth.   There are several powerful \"points of entry\" described in Howard Gardners,   The Disciplined Mind, that provide excellent insight into sharpening   the senses. They instruct on how to organize, interpret and understand information   based on how it affects our different senses. These methods teach us how to   enhance our ability to gain knowledge. This will give way to the definitions   implied by the terms true, good and beautiful.   Using an aesthetic entry point, and strong reference to the Holocaust, Howard   Gardner, in The Disciplined Mind, explains this entry point by using   vivid imagery describing \"Robin Lakes Dissonance who seeks to convey the experience   of the concentration camps in dance. Consider this description: In the first   sectionwe see the dancers in a series of split-second flashes of light dying   horrible deaths. A man suspended on a wire is electrocuted in his desperate   attempts at escape. Bodies fall from the flaming ovens into a pile. The images   are powerful in their detail; we feel the mans spasms against the fence as   death throes, we feel the limp bodies stiffening into the contorted shapes only   corpses could retainscenes gradually lengthen into scenarios-prisoners on their   way to concentration camps, couples separated against their willnameless victims   have become real, identifiable people before youyou really feel as if you might   have a number tattooed on your arm. The arms of barbed wire in front of you   could as easily be enclosing you. You could as easily be dressed in the dancers   rags and bandages.\" (195). The approach in this description uses the art of   dance and setting of a stage. It captures the very essence of our mind that   allows us to imagine or picture the actual scene, as described and intended.   The scene is carefully arranged and performed to achieve the highest sense in   ones mind the illustration and understanding of the dance. The images are set   to engage the senses and become powerful tools in giving the audience a clear   picture to understanding the actual experience. This type of entry point allows   us to gain our own interpretation using artistic expression set in motion. In   which case, may be perceived as a beautiful art form, or a hellish description   played out in a drama. This offers the reader the opportunity to associate with,   and decide for himself his regard on the events that took place and their significance   to him.   Using a hands-on point of entry is also a powerful and invoking approach to   understanding. This is acutely demonstrated in Howard Gardners, The Disciplined   Mind , \"In some Holocaust exhibits designed for young people, each visitor   receives upon entry the name and photo of an actual European Jewish child. At   the end of the exhibition, the visitor learns the fate of that child.\" (197).   Given the suggestive intention of this depiction and of the provocative substance,   the visitor is lead through a series of dramatic events and given the opportunity   to identify with a victim of the Holocaust through a physical representation.   This is to allow that person to develop a real connection, an understanding,   and perhaps an appreciation for a fellow human being who experienced the worst   sensation life has to offer; torture and ultimately death through the iniquity   of other human beings. By inciting another aspect of interest, like this physical   and dramatic exhibition, one is able to gain this perspective and feeling of   the Holocaust through a heightened sense of perception.   A Mozart masterpiece is like a beautiful and soundly-constructed building.   Each piece, each artistic decision, must be carefully, by design, placed in   the right fashion with the intent to create and complete a perfect structure.   Howard Gardner illustrates effectively how a entire work of art can be envisioned   before it has been written or played out, achieving the desired result. A building   is a representation of someones complete thought through fruition, as is a   masterpiece a voice inside ones soul sounding out every note perfectly and   finally composed on paper and eloquently flowed through the senses. In a narrative   entry point, using a story telling or poetic form of communication, we can be   enchanted to discover through musical works, cinema or other forms of art expressions   and lead into another form of understanding and perception. As stated by Howard   Gardner, in The Disciplined Mind , \"Perhaps the most effective way to   involve a large number of learners is through vivid, dramatic narrative. People   of all ages find stories inviting.\" (189), we can begin to see what he means   by viewing one of Mozarts masterpieces as a story. Mozarts works are considered   complete stories because his compositions illustrate epics as a series of events   as deep and complicated as his own perception and experiences of life. He innately   captures his audiences attention and his focus of intention moves us through   his plays of life and his works of art steadily and effectively. Music is a   powerful and boundless form of expression in any language and delivers the message   of the performer accurately, gracefully and impartially.   The term learning is defined in The American Heritage College Dictionary ,   as \"The act, process, or experience of gaining knowledge or skill, 2. knowledge   or skill gained through schooling or study, 3. Psychol . Behavioral modification   through experience or conditioning.\" (772) According to eXperinti@, \"Experienced   based- All learning is experience based. Whether we hear a lecture, watch a   video, or read a book, our learning is \"based\" on those experiences. Unfortunately,   we remember 20% of what we hear, 50% of what we see, but 80% of what we do.\"   (pg. 1)   The Sierra Club Foundation is a well-known organization dedicated to the preservation   and education of our wilderness, based in San Francisco, CA. Within the Sierra   Club, lies Inner City Outings (ICO), a not for profit community outreach program   run by volunteers trained in recreational, outdoor and safety skills in addition   to environmental education and assigned in regional chapters across the US.   In their bi-monthly newsletter Inner City Outings ICO National News ,   I found their Mission Statement: The mission of the Sierra Clubs Inner City   Outings Program is to promote personal development by linking cultures, fostering   respect of self and others and providing leadership skills and to promote appreciation   and protection of our local and global environments through a process of spiritual   growth and sharing. The ICO program meets these goals by providing safe and   enjoyable outdoor experiences for persons who might not otherwise have them.\"   (pg. 1)   I spoke with several members in different levels of ICO to gain further insight   and purpose into their organization. The first ICO group was established in   1971 in the Sierra Clubs San Francisco Bay Chapter. I had the honor and pleasure   of speaking to one of the first founders in the Bay Chapter, Madeline Pyeatt.   Madeline is the chapters ICO leader and a teacher at Oakland Technical High   School. She created several of the ICOs activities like the rafting company   and runs the trails club which is the oldest running function since its founding.   \"I am at more of an advantage than most ICO volunteers because most of the children   who participate in my outings are also my students. I am able to see and keep   track of the impression that is made on my kids first hand.\" (M. Peaytt) Madeline   expressed her firm belief that not only wilderness skills are attained, but   problem solving techniques, team work, as well as, self-confidence from being   challenged and pushing ones limits, and by being able to recognize how good   it feels once they are there. \"Leaders are taught how to handle people who are   afraid of taking the next step or a challenge and see them through, which builds   their confidence and skills as leaders.\" (M. Peaytt) Madeline added, \"After   just a single day hike or backpack trip, I am not considered the students teacher   anymore, but a friend and that is most rewarding for me and my students. Trust   is gained, lessons are learned, and challenges are met with guidance, teamwork   and spirit.\" (M. Peaytt)   Madeline shared one of her prize student success stories with me, a student   who entered her ICO group from the recommendation of a counselor from the local   social services office. She asked me to keep in mind this was an extreme case   but also a chief example of how and what the ICO provides especially for disadvantaged   youth. Madeline was introduced to a twelve year old boy who was homeless and   uneducated. The boys counselor thought it would be a good idea of Madeline spent   time with him. She decided to take him on one of her upper level back packing   day trips. On the day of a scheduled trip, the worst storm of the year occurred   and all of the other kids backed out so it was just she, her new student and   a co-leader left remaining to take the trip. \"This boy had not had exposure   to much of anything before this particular day, especially the wilderness. He   took on the challenge with enthusiasm and heart and this excursion proved to   be a motivating and empowering experience for him, he had a wonderful time and   loved the freedom of the woods. Right away I noticed the effect of being surrounded   in the wilderness under extreme conditions had on him and how he started to   feel significant and strong.\" (M. Peaytt) Madeline adopted him and took him   under her wings. Within one year, this child succeeded in the ICO program by   becoming a backpacking leader certified in first aid and a white water rafting   leader certified in advanced wilderness first aid. At first, he didnt succeed   in achieving this goal, however, after working even harder at it and with the   support and guidance of Madeline and other co-leaders, he proved to the rafting   club that he was capable and devoted, allowing him to achieve his own status   as leader. Madeline also bragged after high school that her student entered   the army, became an EMT and attained Combat Medic Status expertise. After the   army, he decided he wanted to be a nurse, so he continued in the direction to   take him there, graduated one year ago and is now working in the Intensive Care   Unit in the local Galley Hospital.   This is an amazing and motivating story of a child who was at a complete disadvantage   to most other children and as stated earlier, he was homeless and did not attend   school until the seventh grade. Through the guidance, care, understanding, help,   encouragement and tools provided by Madeline, the ICO and its volunteers, he   was able to achieve a higher perception and awareness in himself, in nature   and in his sense of self worth. This enabled him to turn his life around and   become a productive, successful, happy and inspiring individual. Madeline is   proud to call him, \"My son and prize student. \" (M. Peaytt)   The volunteers of ICO believe in what the wilderness has to offer young children   in the way of discovering the beauty of the wild lands they treasure, the beauty   they can find within themselves, and how to enjoy these areas without harming   them. The ICO outings are one approach to teaching students about their surroundings,   learning about their strengths and how to overcome fears and inhibitions through   the use and experience of our natural world. These children are given an opportunity   they normally wouldnt have, to learn something new about the world they live   in and are shown how to respect and appreciate what our natural world is. Through   the guidance of the volunteers and participation in various outings which include   day hikes, backpacking, car camping, canoeing, white water rafting, bicycling   and cross country skiing, the children get involved in educational and enjoyable   activities, which allows them to become more aware of their surroundings, themselves   and their impact on nature. It is proven that through learning outdoor skills   about the wilderness environment, by fostering teamwork and cooperation, integral   parts of the ICO, children are better able to communicate and face the challenges   they encounter in their own life with confidence and success.   In The Path to Tranquility, His Holiness, The Dalai Lama succinctly   puts it this way, \"Human happiness and human satisfaction must ultimately come   from within one self. It is wrong to expect some final satisfaction to come   from money or from a computer.\" (pg. 38) It is learning to rely on ones self   and appreciating ones spirit, which will carry one to the next step, to climb   the next rock, jump to the next stone. Hiking/foot paths are varied in difficulty   and sometimes unpredictable. Some paths are rocky and steep and filled with   pricker bushes that go on for miles. While others are filled with fragrant and   flowery bushes leading downhill to a beautiful and lush landing of a cool stream.   Other paths can be a mixture of both and compliment each other in the process.   In getting through the rocky and tough terrain, one must remain focused and   aware of what is underfoot, all around and what may lie ahead in order to become   conscious of how to proceed. This is a challenge in itself. One relies on what   they already know and are capable of doing but may call for answers and strength   they do not have, nonetheless, still must generate the energy to get past the   challenge or through the pricker bushes without getting scrapped, cut or even   worse, scarred. One must ask oneself, \"How do I get past these pricker bushes   when I do not have hedge clippers?\" It is at this point, that one must carefully   attend to the situation at hand, and think about how they should get out of   it or to sit there and cry. Most, would choose the former.   His Holiness, The Dalai Lama also states in The Path to Tranquility ,   \"Tranquil or calm abiding is a heightened state of awareness possessing a very   single pointed nature, accompanied by faculties of mental and physical suppleness.   Your body and mind become especially flexible, receptive and serviceable. Special   insight is a heightened state of awareness, also accompanied by mental and physical   suppleness, in which your faculty of analysis is immensely advanced, thus, calm   abiding is absorptive in nature, whereas special insight is analytic in nature.\"   (pg. 57)   By asking ourselves to face the challenge and recognize what needs to be done,   we can succeed in the action and realize what is implied by the terms heightened   perception and awareness of ourselves through the natural world. If one remembers   the necessary steps taken to get through the steep, rocky, pricker bush filled   path, and what was asked of themselves, one can strike through and face any   challenge posed in the path of their own life with confidence, strength and   awareness.   According to eXperienti@, As Confucius said : I hear and I forget,   I see and I remember, I do and I understand. (pg. 1)   An educator and author of Sharing Nature With Children and Listening   to Nature, Joseph Cornell, reaches out to fellow educators on the importance   of getting kids and adults in tune with nature. Joseph Cornell holds conferences   and retreats for adults on how to deepen ones awareness of nature. People who   have attended his retreats walk away with something they could not have attained   elsewhere. A statement made on Sharing Nature Foundation website from   a participant in a past retreat declares \"This conference was so powerful because   it prepares you for both the inspirational and practical side of nature activities.   I feel I have touched nature with my heart, and I have the techniques to share   it with others.\" (pg. 1) One is presented with the necessary tools to heighten   ones awareness and to perceive nature and the impact it can have on them personally.   They, in turn share their experience and knowledge with the people they can   have a positive influence on. \"I would most certainly recommend this conference   to my colleagues and friends. What made this week so special was the combination   of conference and retreat. It provided so many direct experiences and a warm,   loving, and supportive atmosphere in which to share new insights and inspiration.\"   This was declared in a testimonial by a woman who also attended one of Joseph   Cornell's Sharing Nature Foundation conferences.   Joseph Cornell is considered an experiential educator who uses the teaching   technique of the act of doing rather than the passive being done to. I applied   one of his techniques to conduct my own experiment using my seven-year-old nephew,   Joey and his six-year-old friend, Ryan as my subjects to prove his philosophy.   They were perfect subjects and happy to volunteer. My intention was to take   them on a nature walk, blindfold them and to tell me what they heard, felt,   and smelled along the way, to identify and express these things in their own   words. In listening   to this adventure, which I highly recommend, my subjects illustrate the reliance   and sensitivity to their other senses that they needed in order to identify   their surroundings. Some of their association with nature came easily, while   other classifications required a moment or longer to name.   We went to a local town park in which they are familiar with. This park has   hiking and biking trails, boat landing for fishers and recreational vehicles,   equipped with a huge playground and picnic areas. Joey helped me gather the   tools I needed in order to conduct this experiment.   We started out on our little nature walk on top of the hill and reiterated   to Joey and Ryan the \"itinerary\". This was actually quite fun and my nephew   and Ryan loved taking part in this, as did their mothers. I held Joeys hand   and my sister held Ryans hand with his mother. As soon as we began our journey,   Joey said to me \"Dew, I hear a dog barking, I hear a dog barking, Dew and that   would be your ears\". Immediate attention to his surroundings without using his   sight, was key. Because I asked him to use his senses other than sight, he was   able to experience the importance of how his other senses interact with nature.   This is acutely demonstrated in the recording of our nature walk.   The next thing I asked them to do was create a sound map, an idea from Sharing   Nature With Children . We sat at the picnic tables located on top of the   hill and the plan was to draw the things in which they heard around them. The   pictures are simple, however, this was an interesting and useful study of how   and what children identify in their surroundings.   One can acquire great knowledge and understanding of many things when we allow   ourselves to be persuaded and introduced to different, as well as, multiple   approaches to understanding and receiving knowledge. We must be taught in a   fashion that allows us to obtain our own perception. Let us open our minds and   delve into the opportunities we have to employ these fantastic and universal   methods of applying and achieving absolute understanding in all areas of knowledge.   It is then, when we can know what is true, good and beautiful and pass these   wonderful things onto our future.       Bibliography     Abram, D., (1996). The Spell of the Sensuous.

These children are given an opportunity   they normally wouldnt have, to learn something new about the world they live   in and are shown how to respect and appreciate what our natural world is. Through   the guidance of the volunteers and participation in various outings which include   day hikes, backpacking, car camping, canoeing, white water rafting, bicycling   and cross country skiing, the children get involved in educational and enjoyable   activities, which allows them to become more aware of their surroundings, themselves   and their impact on nature. It is proven that through learning outdoor skills   about the wilderness environment, by fostering teamwork and cooperation, integral   parts of the ICO, children are better able to communicate and face the challenges   they encounter in their own life with confidence and success.   In The Path to Tranquility, His Holiness, The Dalai Lama succinctly   puts it this way, \"Human happiness and human satisfaction must ultimately come   from within one self. It is wrong to expect some final satisfaction to come   from money or from a computer.\" (pg. 38) It is learning to rely on ones self   and appreciating ones spirit, which will carry one to the next step, to climb   the next rock, jump to the next stone. Hiking/foot paths are varied in difficulty   and sometimes unpredictable. Some paths are rocky and steep and filled with   pricker bushes that go on for miles. While others are filled with fragrant and   flowery bushes leading downhill to a beautiful and lush landing of a cool stream.   Other paths can be a mixture of both and compliment each other in the process.   In getting through the rocky and tough terrain, one must remain focused and   aware of what is underfoot, all around and what may lie ahead in order to become   conscious of how to proceed. This is a challenge in itself. One relies on what   they already know and are capable of doing but may call for answers and strength   they do not have, nonetheless, still must generate the energy to get past the   challenge or through the pricker bushes without getting scrapped, cut or even   worse, scarred. One must ask oneself, \"How do I get past these pricker bushes   when I do not have hedge clippers?\" It is at this point, that one must carefully   attend to the situation at hand, and think about how they should get out of   it or to sit there and cry. Most, would choose the former.   His Holiness, The Dalai Lama also states in The Path to Tranquility ,   \"Tranquil or calm abiding is a heightened state of awareness possessing a very   single pointed nature, accompanied by faculties of mental and physical suppleness.   Your body and mind become especially flexible, receptive and serviceable. Special   insight is a heightened state of awareness, also accompanied by mental and physical   suppleness, in which your faculty of analysis is immensely advanced, thus, calm   abiding is absorptive in nature, whereas special insight is analytic in nature.\"   (pg. 57)   By asking ourselves to face the challenge and recognize what needs to be done,   we can succeed in the action and realize what is implied by the terms heightened   perception and awareness of ourselves through the natural world. If one remembers   the necessary steps taken to get through the steep, rocky, pricker bush filled   path, and what was asked of themselves, one can strike through and face any   challenge posed in the path of their own life with confidence, strength and   awareness.   According to eXperienti@, As Confucius said : I hear and I forget,   I see and I remember, I do and I understand. (pg. 1)   An educator and author of Sharing Nature With Children and Listening   to Nature, Joseph Cornell, reaches out to fellow educators on the importance   of getting kids and adults in tune with nature. Joseph Cornell holds conferences   and retreats for adults on how to deepen ones awareness of nature. People who   have attended his retreats walk away with something they could not have attained   elsewhere. A statement made on Sharing Nature Foundation website from   a participant in a past retreat declares \"This conference was so powerful because   it prepares you for both the inspirational and practical side of nature activities.   I feel I have touched nature with my heart, and I have the techniques to share   it with others.\" (pg. 1) One is presented with the necessary tools to heighten   ones awareness and to perceive nature and the impact it can have on them personally.   They, in turn share their experience and knowledge with the people they can   have a positive influence on. \"I would most certainly recommend this conference   to my colleagues and friends. What made this week so special was the combination   of conference and retreat. It provided so many direct experiences and a warm,   loving, and supportive atmosphere in which to share new insights and inspiration.\"   This was declared in a testimonial by a woman who also attended one of Joseph   Cornell's Sharing Nature Foundation conferences.   Joseph Cornell is considered an experiential educator who uses the teaching   technique of the act of doing rather than the passive being done to. I applied   one of his techniques to conduct my own experiment using my seven-year-old nephew,   Joey and his six-year-old friend, Ryan as my subjects to prove his philosophy.   They were perfect subjects and happy to volunteer. My intention was to take   them on a nature walk, blindfold them and to tell me what they heard, felt,   and smelled along the way, to identify and express these things in their own   words. In listening   to this adventure, which I highly recommend, my subjects illustrate the reliance   and sensitivity to their other senses that they needed in order to identify   their surroundings. Some of their association with nature came easily, while   other classifications required a moment or longer to name.   We went to a local town park in which they are familiar with. This park has   hiking and biking trails, boat landing for fishers and recreational vehicles,   equipped with a huge playground and picnic areas. Joey helped me gather the   tools I needed in order to conduct this experiment.   We started out on our little nature walk on top of the hill and reiterated   to Joey and Ryan the \"itinerary\". This was actually quite fun and my nephew   and Ryan loved taking part in this, as did their mothers. I held Joeys hand   and my sister held Ryans hand with his mother. As soon as we began our journey,   Joey said to me \"Dew, I hear a dog barking, I hear a dog barking, Dew and that   would be your ears\". Immediate attention to his surroundings without using his   sight, was key. Because I asked him to use his senses other than sight, he was   able to experience the importance of how his other senses interact with nature.   This is acutely demonstrated in the recording of our nature walk.   The next thing I asked them to do was create a sound map, an idea from Sharing   Nature With Children . We sat at the picnic tables located on top of the   hill and the plan was to draw the things in which they heard around them. The   pictures are simple, however, this was an interesting and useful study of how   and what children identify in their surroundings.   One can acquire great knowledge and understanding of many things when we allow   ourselves to be persuaded and introduced to different, as well as, multiple   approaches to understanding and receiving knowledge. We must be taught in a   fashion that allows us to obtain our own perception. Let us open our minds and   delve into the opportunities we have to employ these fantastic and universal   methods of applying and achieving absolute understanding in all areas of knowledge.   It is then, when we can know what is true, good and beautiful and pass these   wonderful things onto our future.       Bibliography     Abram, D., (1996). The Spell of the Sensuous.

Sight, sound, touch, smell and taste together contribute to how we understand and experience our surroundings. Conventional input and output for interactive media has made very limited use of our sensory system. As ubiquitous computing expands and applications for interactivity extend to more atmospheric realms, so does the potential for more multi-sensory design. Our goal is to expand the palette of interaction design to more fully engage our sensory apparatus. A particular focus will be on the aesthetic possibilities of such multi-sensory design. We will look at our senses in various combinations, examining how they closely interact and relate with one another. While smell and taste may not necessarily be directly evoked, it is possible to inspire these through a curious combination of audio-visual and tactile stimuli. A series of small assignments, each with a different sensory focus, some of them involving electronics, some not, will be followed by a more resolved final project.

{"detail": [{"content": "There are five senses that we are born with           Heightened Sensory Perception   by Julia Schneider   N.B.   This document contains attached audio file on a nature walk      We have lost the drive to discover or remember the importance of our natural   world. In our American Society at the turn of this century in the year two thousand,   true regard for what the natural world provides us is being lost and replaced   by fast paced, technology driven stimuli. It is the constant pressure of keeping   up with and as much as one knows about computers and cell phones, one knows   very little about himself. The process of reawakening the senses, by experiencing   the natural world leads to an awareness and perception of oneself that enriches   ones life. In order for a person to increase their sensitivity to their other   senses, one should experience the natural world by submerging or engaging in   it by hiking, biking, camping, white water rafting, etc. If we can focus more   energy on improving this area, naturally, our senses will begin to reawaken,   allowing us to gain better control over our lives. There are several different   vocations which demonstrate the positive effects of such exposure and learning   and the results prove worthwhile, specifically looking at the efforts taken   by educators, organizations, volunteers and spiritual leaders who are dedicated   to opening the minds of our youth.   There are several powerful \"points of entry\" described in Howard Gardners,   The Disciplined Mind, that provide excellent insight into sharpening   the senses. They instruct on how to organize, interpret and understand information   based on how it affects our different senses. These methods teach us how to   enhance our ability to gain knowledge. This will give way to the definitions   implied by the terms true, good and beautiful.   Using an aesthetic entry point, and strong reference to the Holocaust, Howard   Gardner, in The Disciplined Mind, explains this entry point by using   vivid imagery describing \"Robin Lakes Dissonance who seeks to convey the experience   of the concentration camps in dance. Consider this description: In the first   sectionwe see the dancers in a series of split-second flashes of light dying   horrible deaths. A man suspended on a wire is electrocuted in his desperate   attempts at escape. Bodies fall from the flaming ovens into a pile. The images   are powerful in their detail; we feel the mans spasms against the fence as   death throes, we feel the limp bodies stiffening into the contorted shapes only   corpses could retainscenes gradually lengthen into scenarios-prisoners on their   way to concentration camps, couples separated against their willnameless victims   have become real, identifiable people before youyou really feel as if you might   have a number tattooed on your arm. The arms of barbed wire in front of you   could as easily be enclosing you. You could as easily be dressed in the dancers   rags and bandages.\" (195). The approach in this description uses the art of   dance and setting of a stage. It captures the very essence of our mind that   allows us to imagine or picture the actual scene, as described and intended.   The scene is carefully arranged and performed to achieve the highest sense in   ones mind the illustration and understanding of the dance. The images are set   to engage the senses and become powerful tools in giving the audience a clear   picture to understanding the actual experience. This type of entry point allows   us to gain our own interpretation using artistic expression set in motion. In   which case, may be perceived as a beautiful art form, or a hellish description   played out in a drama. This offers the reader the opportunity to associate with,   and decide for himself his regard on the events that took place and their significance   to him.   Using a hands-on point of entry is also a powerful and invoking approach to   understanding. This is acutely demonstrated in Howard Gardners, The Disciplined   Mind , \"In some Holocaust exhibits designed for young people, each visitor   receives upon entry the name and photo of an actual European Jewish child. At   the end of the exhibition, the visitor learns the fate of that child.\" (197).   Given the suggestive intention of this depiction and of the provocative substance,   the visitor is lead through a series of dramatic events and given the opportunity   to identify with a victim of the Holocaust through a physical representation.   This is to allow that person to develop a real connection, an understanding,   and perhaps an appreciation for a fellow human being who experienced the worst   sensation life has to offer; torture and ultimately death through the iniquity   of other human beings. By inciting another aspect of interest, like this physical   and dramatic exhibition, one is able to gain this perspective and feeling of   the Holocaust through a heightened sense of perception.   A Mozart masterpiece is like a beautiful and soundly-constructed building.   Each piece, each artistic decision, must be carefully, by design, placed in   the right fashion with the intent to create and complete a perfect structure.   Howard Gardner illustrates effectively how a entire work of art can be envisioned   before it has been written or played out, achieving the desired result. A building   is a representation of someones complete thought through fruition, as is a   masterpiece a voice inside ones soul sounding out every note perfectly and   finally composed on paper and eloquently flowed through the senses. In a narrative   entry point, using a story telling or poetic form of communication, we can be   enchanted to discover through musical works, cinema or other forms of art expressions   and lead into another form of understanding and perception. As stated by Howard   Gardner, in The Disciplined Mind , \"Perhaps the most effective way to   involve a large number of learners is through vivid, dramatic narrative. People   of all ages find stories inviting.\" (189), we can begin to see what he means   by viewing one of Mozarts masterpieces as a story. Mozarts works are considered   complete stories because his compositions illustrate epics as a series of events   as deep and complicated as his own perception and experiences of life. He innately   captures his audiences attention and his focus of intention moves us through   his plays of life and his works of art steadily and effectively. Music is a   powerful and boundless form of expression in any language and delivers the message   of the performer accurately, gracefully and impartially.   The term learning is defined in The American Heritage College Dictionary ,   as \"The act, process, or experience of gaining knowledge or skill, 2. knowledge   or skill gained through schooling or study, 3. Psychol . Behavioral modification   through experience or conditioning.\" (772) According to eXperinti@, \"Experienced   based- All learning is experience based. Whether we hear a lecture, watch a   video, or read a book, our learning is \"based\" on those experiences. Unfortunately,   we remember 20% of what we hear, 50% of what we see, but 80% of what we do.\"   (pg. 1)   The Sierra Club Foundation is a well-known organization dedicated to the preservation   and education of our wilderness, based in San Francisco, CA. Within the Sierra   Club, lies Inner City Outings (ICO), a not for profit community outreach program   run by volunteers trained in recreational, outdoor and safety skills in addition   to environmental education and assigned in regional chapters across the US.   In their bi-monthly newsletter Inner City Outings ICO National News ,   I found their Mission Statement: The mission of the Sierra Clubs Inner City   Outings Program is to promote personal development by linking cultures, fostering   respect of self and others and providing leadership skills and to promote appreciation   and protection of our local and global environments through a process of spiritual   growth and sharing. The ICO program meets these goals by providing safe and   enjoyable outdoor experiences for persons who might not otherwise have them.\"   (pg. 1)   I spoke with several members in different levels of ICO to gain further insight   and purpose into their organization. The first ICO group was established in   1971 in the Sierra Clubs San Francisco Bay Chapter. I had the honor and pleasure   of speaking to one of the first founders in the Bay Chapter, Madeline Pyeatt.   Madeline is the chapters ICO leader and a teacher at Oakland Technical High   School. She created several of the ICOs activities like the rafting company   and runs the trails club which is the oldest running function since its founding.   \"I am at more of an advantage than most ICO volunteers because most of the children   who participate in my outings are also my students. I am able to see and keep   track of the impression that is made on my kids first hand.\" (M. Peaytt) Madeline   expressed her firm belief that not only wilderness skills are attained, but   problem solving techniques, team work, as well as, self-confidence from being   challenged and pushing ones limits, and by being able to recognize how good   it feels once they are there. \"Leaders are taught how to handle people who are   afraid of taking the next step or a challenge and see them through, which builds   their confidence and skills as leaders.\" (M. Peaytt) Madeline added, \"After   just a single day hike or backpack trip, I am not considered the students teacher   anymore, but a friend and that is most rewarding for me and my students. Trust   is gained, lessons are learned, and challenges are met with guidance, teamwork   and spirit.\" (M. Peaytt)   Madeline shared one of her prize student success stories with me, a student   who entered her ICO group from the recommendation of a counselor from the local   social services office. She asked me to keep in mind this was an extreme case   but also a chief example of how and what the ICO provides especially for disadvantaged   youth. Madeline was introduced to a twelve year old boy who was homeless and   uneducated. The boys counselor thought it would be a good idea of Madeline spent   time with him. She decided to take him on one of her upper level back packing   day trips. On the day of a scheduled trip, the worst storm of the year occurred   and all of the other kids backed out so it was just she, her new student and   a co-leader left remaining to take the trip. \"This boy had not had exposure   to much of anything before this particular day, especially the wilderness. He   took on the challenge with enthusiasm and heart and this excursion proved to   be a motivating and empowering experience for him, he had a wonderful time and   loved the freedom of the woods. Right away I noticed the effect of being surrounded   in the wilderness under extreme conditions had on him and how he started to   feel significant and strong.\" (M. Peaytt) Madeline adopted him and took him   under her wings. Within one year, this child succeeded in the ICO program by   becoming a backpacking leader certified in first aid and a white water rafting   leader certified in advanced wilderness first aid. At first, he didnt succeed   in achieving this goal, however, after working even harder at it and with the   support and guidance of Madeline and other co-leaders, he proved to the rafting   club that he was capable and devoted, allowing him to achieve his own status   as leader. Madeline also bragged after high school that her student entered   the army, became an EMT and attained Combat Medic Status expertise. After the   army, he decided he wanted to be a nurse, so he continued in the direction to   take him there, graduated one year ago and is now working in the Intensive Care   Unit in the local Galley Hospital.   This is an amazing and motivating story of a child who was at a complete disadvantage   to most other children and as stated earlier, he was homeless and did not attend   school until the seventh grade. Through the guidance, care, understanding, help,   encouragement and tools provided by Madeline, the ICO and its volunteers, he   was able to achieve a higher perception and awareness in himself, in nature   and in his sense of self worth. This enabled him to turn his life around and   become a productive, successful, happy and inspiring individual. Madeline is   proud to call him, \"My son and prize student. \" (M. Peaytt)   The volunteers of ICO believe in what the wilderness has to offer young children   in the way of discovering the beauty of the wild lands they treasure, the beauty   they can find within themselves, and how to enjoy these areas without harming   them. The ICO outings are one approach to teaching students about their surroundings,   learning about their strengths and how to overcome fears and inhibitions through   the use and experience of our natural world.

Sight, sound, touch, smell and taste together contribute to how we understand and experience our surroundings. Conventional input and output for interactive media has made very limited use of our sensory system. As ubiquitous computing expands and applications for interactivity extend to more atmospheric realms, so does the potential for more multi-sensory design. Our goal is to expand the palette of interaction design to more fully engage our sensory apparatus. A particular focus will be on the aesthetic possibilities of such multi-sensory design. We will look at our senses in various combinations, examining how they closely interact and relate with one another. While smell and taste may not necessarily be directly evoked, it is possible to inspire these through a curious combination of audio-visual and tactile stimuli. A series of small assignments, each with a different sensory focus, some of them involving electronics, some not, will be followed by a more resolved final project.    Prerequisites: H79.2301 Introduction to Physical Computing and H79.2025 Materials and Building Strategies (or equivalent experience).

In this class we look at information visualization as used in scientific representation. We create visualizations of the data that triggers our five senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste). In the process, we look at each of the canonical phases of information visualization: acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interact. The projects cover the range of modes of scientific visualization: photography, diagrams, illustrations, and models. By identifying the constraints of the data set and the insight to be communicated, students learn to develop the appropriate and creative methods for their visualizations. The class has bi-weekly assignments in which students use the Processing environment to present 5 data sets. Students learn to identify one question to be answered about the data and how to \u201csketch\u201d using processing. One assignment is a fully developed one for a final project, incorporating scientific data. We provide data sets or tools for collecting the data as starting points for each assignment. Basic programming skills are required. During the semester, we look at and read about great moments in scientific visualization whose range includes the double helix model, bubble chambers, and the Eames\u2019 powers of 10. Readings, films, and images hone in on representations of sense material.
