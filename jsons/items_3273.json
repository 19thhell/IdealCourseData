Students in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) need to fulfill 4 semesters of language as part of their College Core Curriculum (CORE). They can also fulfill their requirement with several placement exams. In-person placement exams in Spanish and Portuguese will be available for CAS students during the summer and throughout the Fall and Spring semesters: http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.placementexams    Portuguese         Spanish speakers with no formal training of Portuguese can  register directly for PORT UA 11 Portuguese for Spanish  Speakers.      Other students with no training in Portuguese can  register for PORT UA 1 Elementary Portuguese I or PORT UA 10  Intensive Elementary Portuguese.      Students with previous formal training and/or familiarity in Portuguese must  go to the College of Arts and Science\u2019s language exam website and take the  online exam, picking Portuguese among the choices: http://www.nyu.edu/cas/flpexam/ . Students will  receive a score placing them in a certain level and must register for that  level.      Students who score above the cutoff can take a written  in-person exam for exemption from the CORE requirement. They must sign up in  advance for the exemption exam. Information on dates and signing up can be  found at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams .  If they wish to continue their study of the language at NYU they must consult  directly with the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu .            Spanish    Students with no previous study of Spanish enroll in SPAN-UA 1 Spanish for Beginners I.

All other students must show proof of placement through the SAT II Placement Test (taken either before entering NYU or offered by CAS), the IB exam or the AP Test. If a student does not have any form of placement test available and has taken Spanish before, he/she needs to take the WebCAPE online placement exam (link provided at the end of this page). Students who have not taken a placement test and have taken Spanish before will not be allowed to stay in a course. There are no exceptions to this rule. Students with college Spanish from institutions other than NYU also need to take a placement test.

At the exam welcome screen students must provide their name, last name, NYU email and N number. The score and placement recommendation will be notified to the student and to the Department of Spanish and Portuguese immediately upon completion of the exam. Students must print their scores and bring them to class on the first week of classes.    Please be aware that the exam must represent each student\u2019s own work. Students are bound by New York University\u2019s College of Arts and Science Code of Academic Integrity ( http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity ), and must abstain from activities constitutive of fraud.
