We will also read about the post-publication history of these works, including Flaubert\u2019s trial for obscenity, Hardy\u2019s plea for \u201cCandour in English Fiction,\u201d and his turning from prose to poetry to escape censorship, and Chopin\u2019s abandoning novel-writing as a result of the controversy over her work. Other readings will likely include selections from J.S. Mill's\u00a0 The Subjection of Women \u00a0, and from the theory of Thorsten Veblen and Michel Foucault.

In this course we will explore controversial novels in which female characters struggle with lives largely limited by the cultural stereotypes of the Angel in the House and the emerging New Woman. Possible readings include Gustave Flaubert\u2019s\u00a0 Madame Bovary ( \u00a01856), Thomas\u00a0 \u00a0Hardy's J\u00a0 ude the Obscure \u00a0(1895), and Kate Chopin's\u00a0 The Awakening \u00a0(1899\u00a0 ) \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0We will contextualize each novel with readings on historical events in the French, English, and American settings. We will also read about the post-publication history of these works, including Flaubert\u2019s trial for obscenity, Hardy\u2019s plea for \u201cCandour in English Fiction,\u201d and his turning from prose to poetry to escape censorship, and Chopin\u2019s abandoning novel-writing as a result of the controversy over her work. Other readings will likely include selections from J.S. Mill's\u00a0 The Subjection of Women \u00a0, and from the theory of Thorsten Veblen and Michel Foucault.
