The mystery                              The Dress   This image started surfacing on social media on Wednesday, February 25, 2015. Here is the original Tumblr post . It depicts a \u20a450 dress and was posted on Tumblr by Caitlin McNeill, a singer and guitarist. The photo itself was taken by the mother of the bride, who also wore the dress at the wedding where McNeill played.   The majority of people \u00a0see the dress as white/gold whereas some see it as blue/black. Why do different people see the colors of the dress differently? The debate \u201cbroke\u201d the Internet in the following two days. In the first week of \u201cDressgate\u201d, there were well in excess of 10 million tweets on this issue (see graph below).   Here are some of the questions being asked:       What are the actual colors of the dress?   Why do different people perceive the colors of the dress so differently? Are there any biological or psychological explanations?   What is special about this particular photo that causes such disagreement?   Are there other instances of this phenomenon?       Besides the first one, these are very difficult questions, which even seasoned vision scientists have struggled to answer. Careful research will be needed, which will take time. In the meantime, we will try here to put together an evolving, annotated repository of data, theories, and speculations.   Tweets per day in millions                                                                                                  Facts and observations                                    FACT #1   The pixels in the image are yellow/brown (some areas are darker than others) and bluish grey. The color names that come closest are goldenrod and light steel blue . Pixel RGB values in various portions of the image are shown below.       What is RGB?     In a computer program such as Photoshop, the color of a pixel can be expressed as three numbers between 0 and 255, together called the RGB value. For example, a pure red pixel would have an RGB value of 255-0-0, a pure green pixel an RGB of 0-255-0, and pure blue pixel an RGB of 0-0-255. A white pixel would have an RGB value of 255-255-255, a black pixel 0-0-0, and a grey pixel would have three equal numbers but not 0 or 255)).               FACT #2   The dress was black and \u201c royal blue \u201d in reality. This has been confirmed by the seller, Roman Originals . The pixels in their online catalog image, below, are close to black (RGB: 0-0-0) and some shade of blue (RGB: 0-0-something)           FACT #3   The photo was overexposed. This was pointed out in an article on mashable.com . When corrected for overexposure, the pixel colors become similar to the ones in the Roman Originals image, as you can see below.               Observations (strong anecdotal evidence)         Different people see the dress differently on the same screen.   Some people can switch between the two percepts, though often when people initially see it one way, they will continue to see it that way.    It is easier to see blue/black if you focus on the bottom half than if you focus on the top half.  When a white/gold perceiver squints, they often start seeing the dress as blue/black.   When a white/gold perceiver views their screen at a shallow angle, they often start seeing the dress as blue/black.   A color-inverted version of the original image (see image on the right) is generally perceived as white/gold, but in the opposite regions.                                                                                                      Flawed explanations                                It's because of differences in screen brightness    Where we read this: http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/   Why it is flawed:   People viewing the same screen can still have vastly different percepts. Plus, if viewing on different screens were the complete explanation, we would experience such disagreements much more frequently than we do.         It's because 25% of people have a fourth cone    Where we read this: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/25-people-have-4th-cone-see-colors-p-prof-diana-derval   Why it is flawed:   While it is true that some people do have more than three cones, the percentage of the population that experiences tetrachromacy is nowhere near 25% . Also, If this was true, people wouldn't be able to switch into the other percept, as many do.         There are two different versions of the image in circulation    Where we read this: Comments sections on news pieces all over the world, also Twitter   Why it is flawed:   This is simply not true. While quite a few people seem to believe that there are actually two different versions of the same image going around, this is not the case. This is not some conspiracy to trick you. Of course - due to people trying various manipulations, there are different versions of the image circulating now, but there was only one original image, and it was unambiguously ambiguous. The easiest way to check this is to download the original image (at the top of this page) to your local computer, then have several people view it.         Differences in the retinal mosaic cause differences in percept    Where we read this explanation: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/business/a-simple-question-about-a-dress-and-the-world-weighs-in.html?_r=0   Why it is probably flawed:   It is true that there are dramatic differences in the distribution of the cones between people. For example, some people may have a lot of short-wavelength cones, whereas others may only have a few. However - to date - this has only accounted for minute (if any) differences in color vision between people. This does not account for the fact that some people \u201cflip\u201d after a while.         Personality factors (optimism, depression, left/right brained, etc.) cause differences in percept    Where we read this: All over the Internet   Why it is probably flawed:   While it is quite possible that personality factors play a role, there is simply no evidence to substantiate this. It is true that depression can affect perception , but only in subtle ways, and it would be very premature to attribute the dress effect to depression.                                                                                                      Narrowing down the problem                              Before we can even try to understand who perceives what dress colors, we have to understand the basics of color vision. At first glance, it may be surprising that the dress color that we perceive is not the same as the color of the light that reaches our eyes. In fact, it is even inaccurate to refer to both of them as colors. What is going on here?!   The illuminant   Light reaching our eye from the dress is a result of light reflecting off the dress. The dress itself does not emit light, it only reflects light from a light source (also called illuminant ), such the sun or a lamp. The light coming from the light source can be thought of as containing certain amounts of red, green, and blue light - the three components of white light. Like pixel colors, light colors can be expressed in terms of RGB values (Explained under Fact #1 above) [Note: This conceptualization is for didactic purposes. Scientists don\u2019t usually talk about the RGB of light but about its spectral density . But there is no reason to get worked up about that right now.]     The reflectance  The true color of the dress is based on the colors of light it reflects. The blue parts of the dress reflect most of the incident blue light, and absorb the red and green light. The reflectance properties can be represented as three decimal numbers. For example, if a surface reflects 50% of the red component, 50% of the green component, and nothing of the blue component, we write it as 0.5-0.5-0.   White light   The color of the light sensed by our eyes is determined by the color of the light source (illuminant) as well as by the reflectance of the surface:      Color of light sensed by the eyes \u00a0= Color of illuminant x Reflectance of surface   Let's do an example. If a surface with reflectance 0.5-0.5-0 is illuminated by white light, with an RGB of 255-255-255, then the R component of the light reaching our eye will be 0.5 x 255 = 128, the G component the same, and the B component 0 x 255 = 0. The resulting RGB is 128-128-0, or yellow. This means that our eyes will sense yellow light. However, that doesn't mean that we will necessary perceive the surface to be yellow - read on to understand that!   Other colors of light   If the same surface is illuminated by pure green light, which has an RGB of 0-255-0, then the light reaching our eyes will have an RGB of 0-128-0 -- dark green light. Imagine what happens if you illuminate that same surface with pure blue light, which has an RGB of 0-0-255. The resulting light reaching our eyes will have an RGB of 0-0-0, meaning no light at all will reach our eye! This is because the only color component of the light (blue) gets completely absorbed by the surface.   The brain   The brain is interested in the \u201ccolor\u201d (reflectance) of the surface, the reflectance, not in the color of the illuminant. The problem is that all the brain has no direct access to the outside world, only the light reaching our eyes. The brain has to interpret the incoming light to infer the color the surface, just like a crime scene investigator has to interpret incomplete evidence to infer how the crime happened, or a physician has to interpret symptoms to infer the patient\u2019s disease. This is shown in the diagram:     [Note: the idea that the brain is a smart investigator working with incomplete and imperfect evidence is an old one, dating back to Hermann von Helmholtz or even Alhazen . The mathematical description of this process is called Bayesian inference , which you might know from Nate Silver's The signal and the noise .]   The punchline   The fundamental difficulty of color vision is that there are multiple different combinations of light source color and surface reflectance that produce the same composition of light in our eyes! For example, yellow light reflecting off of a green surface will produce exactly the same composition of light in our eyes (RGB of 0-128-0) as green light reflecting off of a yellow surface.   This is an example of ambiguity : the brain cannot know for sure what the reflectance of the dress is, if it doesn\u2019t know the color of the illuminant.   Your brain is tasked with the difficult problem of reconstructing the reflectance of the surface without being given enough information. Scientists would say: the color of the illuminant is a nuisance parameter in the inference of surface reflectance.   How the brain solves this problem   This problem is really hard to solve! It\u2019s easiest if it is known what the color of the illuminant is. In that case, the brain can divide the color of the light sensed by the eyes by the color of the illuminant:     Reflectance of dress = Color of light sensed by the eyes / Color of illuminant     In other words: if we know the color of the light source, we can take it into account and perfectly reconstruct the reflectance of the surface - problem solved! Scientists would say: the brain discounts the illuminant.   This reconstructed reflectance becomes the color we perceive, or our percept . Now you will probably understand the opening statement of this section: what we perceive is not the color of the light sensed by our eyes, but the reconstructed reflectance after discounting the illuminant.   Examples   You may say at this point: isn\u2019t this too theoretical? How can I actually experience this? There are some really nice examples out there, all with the same principle: If we believe the color of the illumination to be different, then we will perceive different surface reflectance (\u201csurface color\u201d) even if the light sensed by our eyes is identical.   The first example is called the simultaneous contrast effect :    Most people will see the left central square as lighter than the right one, even though their pixel RGBs are identical. To verify that they are identical, punch two holes in a piece of paper, such that you can see a small portion of the left central square and the corresponding portion of the right central square when you hold the paper in front of your screen. Then compare. It may be even easier if you print the image out.   Ted Adelson , a world expert on color vision, explains the simultaneous contrast effect using the following diagram:    If we believe the left square is in the shadow and the right one is in the light, we discount the illuminant and conclude that the left one must be lighter than the right one.   Here is the same idea but with red and brown:     The pixel colors of the central discs, and therefore the RGBs of the light sensed by our eyes, are identical between the left and right (namely 190-82-20). We recommend that you do the two-hole test again!   The following demo by Dale Purves and Beau Lotto , also renowned color vision experts, was already famous and has been making the rounds in the wake of Dressgate. The pixel colors of the two marked squares and therefore the RGBs of the light sensed by our eyes, are identical, namely mid-level grey. We recommend that you do the two-hole test again! Yet, the left one appears blue, the right one yellow.     This same Lotto-Purves idea has been applied to the dress: if we cast the surroundings in blue or yellow light, then the same dress images will be viewed differently, because our brain discounts the illuminant. Here is the XKCD (a.k.a. geek heaven) version of that:     The pixel colors of the dress, and therefore the RGBs of the light sensed by our eyes, are identical between the left and right! Again, you can do the two-hole test.   Rosa Lafer-Sousa, a graduate student in the lab of Nancy Kanwisher at MIT , had the brilliant idea of embedding the dress in the Lotto-Purves image:     Again, the pixel colors of the dress in both images are exactly identical (it is the unedited original dress image!), but the dress appears different on both sides because our brain discounts the illuminant. No matter how you perceived the original dress image, here, you probably have little trouble seeing the left dress as blue/black and the right one as white/gold.   In all these examples, the context or surroundings inform us about the light source. Scientist s would say: the brain uses context to infer the illuminant, and then discounts the illuminant to infer the reflectance of the surface.   Color constancy   We tend to perceive the same surface reflectance in Rosa's left image above as in the catalog picture from Roman Originals (top of page), even though the light hitting their eyes is different . This is called color constancy . It means that when viewing Rosa's image, we are successful in discounting the illuminant.   Does this solve our mystery?     No, but it helps. In all examples above, the context gave us strong clues about illumination. Sometimes, like in the mystery dress image, we have very little information. Some people might nevertheless correctly figure out that the dress was brightly lit (the gloss on the top part of the dress can be a strong clue), and then discount that illuminant. In effect, these people would subconsciously be \"correcting for overexposure\" and \"correcting for light source color\" just like you can do in Photoshop. Stated yet differently, they will have good color constancy.   But not everyone might correctly figure out the illumination. This leads us to the following hypothesis:         Hypothesis: Different people infer the color of the dress differently because they have different beliefs about the color of the light (illuminant).         This hypothesis is by no means scientific fact yet. However, it makes sense given all we know about color vision, and it is one that most experts subscribe to.   The hypothesis does not solve our mystery, but narrows it down: instead of asking \u201cWhat causes people to perceive the dress differently?\u201d we can now ask the more specific question \u201cWhat might cause people to have different beliefs about the color of the illumination?\u201d. We will now examine this question.                                                                                                  Origins of illumination beliefs                              There are several possibilities where beliefs about illumination might come from. Some of these beliefs have to do with our expectations that based on our previous life experiences or are innate; these beliefs have nothing to do with the photo itself and are called priors . Other beliefs about illumination have to do with cues in the photo itself; these are called posteriors .   First some possible priors:       Owls vs. Larks   Whether someone is a morning person (lark) or a night person (owl) is largely determined by genetics. This lifestyle will dramatically affect the spectral mixture that one tends to be exposed to. Specifically, owls are expected to be exposed to more artificial lighting, which has a long-wavelength bias, meaning owls will expect warm light to be more likely. A bright warm light would lead to perception of the the dress as blue and black. By contrast, larks would be more likely to perceive the dress as white/gold.       Inside vs. Outside   Similar to the Owl vs. Larks explanation, the lighting of the environment can affect prior color exposure and subsequently, expectations. Sunlight has a broad spectrum while most artificial lighting is long wavelength. Fluorescent lighting has sharp peaks. Therefore, people who tend to work outside in the sun would be more likely to perceive the dress as white/gold and those that tend to work inside would be more likely to perceive the dress as blue/black.       Extended Exposure to Illuminated Screens   Most computer screens, cell phones, and tablets are so bright that they are calibrated towards cooler colors and shorter wavelengths, therefore, people who spend a lot of time looking at screens would be likely to see the dress as white/gold.       Perceptual History   People seek out what they like. People with different preferences can be expected to have a different perceptual history. Someone who likes warmer colors, such as red or orange, will have had more exposure to long wavelengths, whereas someone with a preference for cooler colors, such as blue or purple, will have had more exposure to short wavelengths. This can be interpreted as a surface prior, not necessarily an illumination prior.       Gold is special   As pointed out by Christoph Witzel , golden highlights occur when\u00a0 a brown-yellow surface is glossy\u00a0 and brightly lit. The dress also has such golden highlights - especially in the top right. Some people might have more extensive experience with glossy surfaces, allowing them to correctly infer the illumination.       Now some possible posteriors:     One belief about the illumination of the dress could derive from the background of the photo, which is brightly lit. One could conclude from that that the dress is brightly lit as well. As a consequence, one would tend to perceive the dress as black/blue in bright light. This would in fact be the correct interpretation.   Another possibility is that the brain notices that the pixels on the dress are on average darker than the pixels of the background. The brain could conclude that the dress is in the shadow, and therefore that the actual colors of the dress are brighter than they seem.   Other background-related cues - for instance, the background seems to be bluer/cooler on top, but warmer/yellowish at the bottom.                                                                                                    Other unsolved questions                              What kind of prior is it?   One of the biggest questions remaining is the question what kind of prior we are dealing with. Most of the expert discussion on this issue has focused on the illumination prior, discussed above. However, there is a second prior to consider, namely a prior over the type of fabric that the dress is made of. The reason this has not been addressed in more detail so far is that this issue is woefully understudied. There are only a few good papers on this, e.g. Adelson et al. (2007), and even they don\u2019t focus on fabric priors itself. Part of the reason is that it is hard to get a handle on someone\u2019s perceptual history. But in this case, it matters. The reason for that is that specularity is probably the reason behind the fact that people see an objectively brownish color of the horizontal stripes on the dress as \u201cgold\u201d (which is not a classical color). But how much of the differential experience is due to different illumination priors and how much due to different fabric priors is an open question and can only be resolved by future research.   Why do some people see the percept flipping, but others do not?   While it is the case that the \u201cdress\u201d stimulus is inherently ambiguous, it doesn\u2019t seem to be an instance of a \u201cbistable\u201d stimulus, like in the case of Rubin\u2019s vase or the \u201cduck/rabbit\u201d. It does flip for some people, but not most and if it does, it takes a very long time to do so, on the order of hours. This is very unusual and might reflect the involvement of perceptual learning. However, which part of the \u201cflipping\u201d is due to changes in interpretation and which results from genuine perceptual learning will only be resolved by further research.                                                                                                  Suggested experiments                              Experiment 1: Expose people to a particular kind of light, see what they see afterwards. To see if there are adaptation effects. This will be very challenging, because there is a strong perceptual learning component to this. It may be difficult finding test subjects who are \u201cnaive\u201d to the dress discussion. Potential subjects may be individuals over 60 years of age, who less active online (on average).   Experiment 2: Put the dress on different backgrounds, like Rosa Lafer-Sousa has done. We hypothesize that individuals who already see it correctly (blue/black versus white/gold) will not be able to \u201cflip\u201d back.   Experiment 3: Track eye movements to see which parts of the dress individual looks at first and how that may affect which colors they see it as. Manipulate conditions by showing only a portion of the dress with specific pixel colors at first, followed by the entire dress. See if that makes a difference.                                                                                                  Conclusion                              It is exciting that a simple photograph can make people think about the nature of their perception and even suggest new directions of research. It is still not entirely clear why some see the dress white/gold and others as blue/black or why some are able to switch between the two while others are stuck with their initial interpretation. It will probably take research on illumination and fabric priors to account for individual differences in the perception of the dress and similar stimuli.
