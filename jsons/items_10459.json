We are proud to be continuing this important tradition in service to our local New York City community as the NYU Clinical Literacy Practicum.    We see first grade children through high school adolescents. Our clients may need intensive tutoring in reading and writing skills or they may be students who just need a little additional help. We focus on word recognition skills (including decoding using phonics), reading and writing fluency, vocabulary development, and comprehension.    All tutors are completing their master's degrees in Literacy Education. Tutoring generally begins with an assessment of the child&rsquo;s reading abilities. Informal and formal measures may focus on such areas as oral reading, word recognition, reading comprehension, spelling, composition, vocabulary, and other related areas. Using the assessment data as a basis, an individual tutoring plan targeted to the child&rsquo;s needs, is developed. Tutoring is conducted either one-on-one or within a small group. The tutoring sessions are scheduled in alignment with the university calendar and are typically offered during the spring and summer semesters. The application period for the spring semester is November 15-December 31. The application period for the July tutoring sessions is April 15-May 31.    Download the clinic brochure for more information on the Literacy Clinic and the services we provide. For the application process to be considered complete, the child's parent and teacher must each submit the electronic application found in the menu bar on this page. Candidates are selected based on a variety of factors including highest need, date of application submission, and availability of tutors.
