But empathy is not exclusively the tool of novelists and playwrights. In our time, journalists such as Alex Kotlowitz, Adrian Nicole LeBlanc, Anne Fadiman and Susan Orlean (and earlier, John Hersey and others) have used a fiercely empathetic approach to create memorable and powerful nonfiction, often with social justice concerns. This course will survey the history and recent practice of empathetic nonfiction, focussing on seminal readings but looking briefly at links to novel-writing, psychology, neuroscience, and human rights. Along the way, we\u2019ll try our own hand at empathetic writing, with assignments that require original reporting and offer a chance to experiment with fundamentals of narrative writing such as scene-setting, character development, and writer\u2019s voice.

But empathy is not exclusively the tool of novelists and playwrights. In our time, journalists such as Alex Kotlowitz, Adrian Nicole LeBlanc, Anne Fadiman and Susan Orlean (and earlier, John Hersey and others) have used a fiercely empathetic approach to create memorable and powerful nonfiction, often with social justice concerns. This course will survey the history and recent practice of empathetic nonfiction, focussing on seminal readings but looking briefly at links to novel-writing, psychology, neuroscience, and human rights. Along the way, we\u2019ll try our own hand at empathetic writing, with assignments that require original reporting and offer a chance to experiment with fundamentals of narrative writing such as scene-setting, character development, and writer\u2019s voice.

No computers. No cell phones in class. Pencil and yellow legal sized paper only. Please be on time. Bring a jacket and a metro card.   For the first class, there is absolute silence when you enter the room. No talking. Not even to say hello to your neighbor. You want to hear a hello? Here it is: Hello. Now, no talking for the first ten minutes of class. It sounds stupid, but it is our first exercise.   Good writing is all about finding the right detail or set of details that will show, not tell, the event to the listener. You are always fighting gravity, always fighting the reader who will close the paper, book, magazine and tune you out. We will focus on placing you in the right mental place to find the details that will tell the story, from your perspective, in a way that is honest to your truth and hold the reader.   There will be some reading aloud in class. There will be no bloodlettings. If you\u2019re willing to fail, you will be successful. If you\u2019re already a journalistic success, this isn\u2019t the class for you. Remember, writing is the act of continually failing at excellence, and uniformity is the ceiling against which great writing will forever bump. The mid term and final will be your writing.   Before each class, you will be expected to read the following excerpts from \u201cA Nietzsche Reader\u201d (Penguin) translated by R. J. Hollingdale. They are not long, but they are important. We may alter this list based on my assessment of your abilities . Reading assignments in Gary Smith and Micheal Herr\u2019s books, as well as our Marvel Comic class, will be assigned as we go deeper into the semester and I am able to assess your abilities.

But empathy is not exclusively the tool of novelists and playwrights. In our time, journalists such as Alex Kotlowitz, Adrian Nicole LeBlanc, Anne Fadiman and Susan Orlean (and earlier, John Hersey and others) have used a fiercely empathetic approach to create memorable and powerful nonfiction, often with social justice concerns. This course will survey the history and recent practice of empathetic nonfiction, focussing on seminal readings but looking briefly at links to novel-writing, psychology, neuroscience, and human rights. Along the way, we\u2019ll try our own hand at empathetic writing, with assignments that require original reporting and offer a chance to experiment with fundamentals of narrative writing such as scene-setting, character development, and writer\u2019s voice.

No computers. No cell phones in class. Pencil and yellow legal sized paper only. Please be on time. Bring a jacket and a metro card.   For the first class, there is absolute silence when you enter the room. No talking. Not even to say hello to your neighbor. You want to hear a hello? Here it is: Hello. Now, no talking for the first ten minutes of class. It sounds stupid, but it is our first exercise.   Good writing is all about finding the right detail or set of details that will show, not tell, the event to the listener. You are always fighting gravity, always fighting the reader who will close the paper, book, magazine and tune you out. We will focus on placing you in the right mental place to find the details that will tell the story, from your perspective, in a way that is honest to your truth and hold the reader.   There will be some reading aloud in class. There will be no bloodlettings. If you\u2019re willing to fail, you will be successful. If you\u2019re already a journalistic success, this isn\u2019t the class for you. Remember, writing is the act of continually failing at excellence, and uniformity is the ceiling against which great writing will forever bump. The mid term and final will be your writing.   Before each class, you will be expected to read the following excerpts from \u201cA Nietzsche Reader\u201d (Penguin) translated by R. J. Hollingdale. They are not long, but they are important. We may alter this list based on my assessment of your abilities . Reading assignments in Gary Smith and Micheal Herr\u2019s books, as well as our Marvel Comic class, will be assigned as we go deeper into the semester and I am able to assess your abilities.

Practice the skills and techniques professionals use to produce story-telling images. Learn to capture fleeting moments, document daily life, and special events. By semester\u2019s end, you should have a basic understanding of the history of photojournalism and the impact photographs have on society, legal and ethical concerns of photojournalists, digital production of photographs, and the importance of captions and text accompanying those photos. You should also have a variety of photojournalistic images suitable for an entry-level portfolio. Many of your images should be suitable for publication.   Develop your own story ideas, cover city and campus events. Edit and scan your own photographs using Adobe Photoshop or any similar image processing program.\u00a0 Share your photos with classmates; critique your own work and theirs in a group setting.   This is NOT a darkroom or basic photography class, but some portion of the class will be focused on teaching basic skills. The emphasis is on taking and editing pictures. A basic understanding of camera operation and exposure is required and recommended.                                               Arthur L.
