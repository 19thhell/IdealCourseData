Our faculty includes writers, ambassadors, and dissidents who helped topple the Communist regime. NYU Prague's successful music program pairs students with the most talented musicians in the nation.   Prague is a vibrant center of culture. NYU Prague students attend global conferences hosted by NYU Prague. Internships are available with international magazines, online news agencies, NGOs and consulting firms. Students explore the bucolic Czech countryside on the many NYU Prague overnight and day trips . Our Kulturama program immerses students in Prague's rich culture - opera, film, theatre, music, Czech cuisine, politics, hockey, and much more.   NYU Prague is the only study abroad site to have a student webzine - The Prague Wandering , aimed at readers around the world. Budding media stars can also work on the PragueCast, our own podcast, entirely produced by students under the leadership of Prague's BBC correspondent.

Our faculty includes writers, ambassadors, and dissidents who helped topple the Communist regime. NYU Prague's successful music program pairs students with the most talented musicians in the nation.   Prague is a vibrant center of culture. NYU Prague students attend global conferences hosted by NYU Prague. Internships are available with international magazines, online news agencies, NGOs and consulting firms. Students explore the bucolic Czech countryside on the many NYU Prague overnight and day trips . Our Kulturama program immerses students in Prague's rich culture - opera, film, theatre, music, Czech cuisine, politics, hockey, and much more.   NYU Prague is the only study abroad site to have a student webzine - The Prague Wandering , aimed at readers around the world. Budding media stars can also work on the PragueCast, our own podcast, entirely produced by students under the leadership of Prague's BBC correspondent.

Our faculty includes writers, ambassadors, and dissidents who helped topple the Communist regime. NYU Prague's successful music program pairs students with the most talented musicians in the nation.   Prague is a vibrant center of culture. NYU Prague students attend global conferences hosted by NYU Prague. Internships are available with international magazines, online news agencies, NGOs and consulting firms. Students explore the bucolic Czech countryside on the many NYU Prague overnight and day trips . Our Kulturama program immerses students in Prague's rich culture - opera, film, theatre, music, Czech cuisine, politics, hockey, and much more.   NYU Prague is the only study abroad site to have a student webzine - The Prague Wandering , aimed at readers around the world. Budding media stars can also work on the PragueCast, our own podcast, entirely produced by students under the leadership of Prague's BBC correspondent.

Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.
