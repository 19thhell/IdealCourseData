Its mission is to enhance and facilitate research on all fields of biological anthropology and archaeology that are broadly related to the study of human origins and evolution from a biological and cultural perspective. The aim is to foster and support multidisciplinary investigations, with an emphasis on the development of collaborative projects, international fieldwork, and state-of-the-art laboratory research. Faculty members associated with the Center currently work on aspects of primate and human paleontology, skeletal biology and comparative anatomy, molecular primatology, primate socioecology and conservation, behavioral endocrinology, Paleolithic archaeology, zooarchaeology, and the origins of symbolism, complex societies, and cities and states. In addition to research, the Center also aims to promote a greater understanding and appreciation of the study of human origins among the academic community and the public at large through conferences, workshops, educational programs, and outreach activities.

Focus is on the extent to which Caribbean people were  given or demanded the freedom to create and maintain a postcolonial  Caribbean identity. We first discuss the sociohistorical conditions that  led to the creation of new Caribbean languages called pidgins and   creoles as the English language was transplanted from Britain to the  Third World. We then explore the relationship of the English-based creoles  to the social, cultural, political, and literary/expressive aspects of the  contexts in which they existed, and in which they continue to exist today  in the Caribbean, as well as in Britain and the United States. As far as  possible, parallels are drawn to French- and Spanish-influenced Caribbean  communities.
