Selected instructors will lead about 10 students in a collaborative semester-long project culminating in a public presentation and written report. Description Capstone seminars are problem-based, project-oriented courses for senior Environmental Studies students. They require self-initiated, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and integrative student work. The capstone entails students working for a client (actual or hypothetical) and using an applied approach to problem solving. Students work collaboratively on a current environmental problem, including characterizing the problem, analyzing possible solutions, implementing solutions, and publicly presenting the results.The aim is to improve a student\u2019s ability to synthesize and integrate material from a range of disciplines while deploying diverse methodologies and vocabularies in a problem-solving context. The capstone relates theoretical knowledge and skills to practical problems, while students work collaboratively in real world situations to research and communicate results to a variety of audiences.Each capstone works as a single team under the leadership of an instructor. Capstones meet weekly. Much of the work will be done outside of class in interviewing stakeholders, analyzing data and visiting sites. Experts may be brought in to brief the seminar on particular aspects of the problem under discussion. At the end of the term, projects are presented to the client, students, NYU faculty, and interested members of the community.

They work with resourceful and purposeful action, propelled to enact a vision of a more just world.   A major contribution of RCLA's research to the leadership field has been illuminating the specific leadership practices that community-based nonprofits employ to build leadership capital and create social change. While often overlooked in leadership studies, social change nonprofits represent a rich and essential resource for US civil society; serve as bellwethers for the field; and enact profound reforms to broken systems and structures. This work toward the common good reflects the human spirit at its best, and this leadership is essential to guarantee, sustain and invigorate democracy.   RCLA's findings are based on eight years of research through the Leadership for a Changing World (LCW) program, a partnership between the Ford Foundation, the Institute for Sustainable Communities* and NYU Wagner.\u00a0 LCW recognized approximately 150 exemplary community leaders who worked in 90 organizations around the country.   The goals of the program were to recognize and better understand social change leadership in American communities in order to contribute to changing the national conversation about leadership to one that recognizes the importance of community leadership and appreciates that leadership comes in many forms and from many different communities.   The Research and Documentation Component, housed at RCLA, was anchored in the belief that creating a new conversation about leadership depends on the ability to describe community leadership clearly and with an authentic voice. RCLA is committed to doing research about leadership with leaders, rather than on leaders.   Therefore, the program worked to generate new knowledge about community leadership through a collaborative approach. Award recipients were invited to become co-researchers and to explore collectively how leadership happens in their communities. Co-researchers were able to observe, analyze their own experience, and share reflections about what makes their practice successful, and what leadership challenges they confront.   Through these activities, we have developed new understandings about the ways in which communities trying to make social change engage in the work of leadership.   *The Institute for Sustainable Communities assumed management of LCW in October 2006 when the Advocacy Institute, which had administered the program since 2000, transferred its operations to ISC.       Leadership as a Collective Achievement   Viewing leadership as a collective achievement moves beyond focusing on the relationship between leaders and followers. It recognizes the process by which people come together to pursue change, and in doing so, together develop a shared vision of what the world should look like, make sense of their experience and shape their decisions and actions.

RCLA's findings are based on eight years of research through the Leadership for a Changing World (LCW) program, a partnership between the Ford Foundation, the Institute for Sustainable Communities* and NYU Wagner.\u00a0 LCW recognized approximately 150 exemplary community leaders who worked in 90 organizations around the country.   The goals of the program were to recognize and better understand social change leadership in American communities in order to contribute to changing the national conversation about leadership to one that recognizes the importance of community leadership and appreciates that leadership comes in many forms and from many different communities.   The Research and Documentation Component, housed at RCLA, was anchored in the belief that creating a new conversation about leadership depends on the ability to describe community leadership clearly and with an authentic voice. RCLA is committed to doing research about leadership with leaders, rather than on leaders.   Therefore, the program worked to generate new knowledge about community leadership through a collaborative approach. Award recipients were invited to become co-researchers and to explore collectively how leadership happens in their communities. Co-researchers were able to observe, analyze their own experience, and share reflections about what makes their practice successful, and what leadership challenges they confront.   Through these activities, we have developed new understandings about the ways in which communities trying to make social change engage in the work of leadership.   *The Institute for Sustainable Communities assumed management of LCW in October 2006 when the Advocacy Institute, which had administered the program since 2000, transferred its operations to ISC.       Leadership as a Collective Achievement   Viewing leadership as a collective achievement moves beyond focusing on the relationship between leaders and followers. It recognizes the process by which people come together to pursue change, and in doing so, together develop a shared vision of what the world should look like, make sense of their experience and shape their decisions and actions.

As the mental health needs of college students increase, both in the number of students seeking services and the severity of the pathology, 2 it is imperative that NYU continue to develop innovative approaches to engage students in necessary treatments.             Key Facts     Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds. 3   22.5% of NYU students reported that anxiety had impacted their academic performance in the past 12 months. 4   55% of NYU students reported that emotional or mental difficulties had hurt their academic performance for one or more days in the past month. 5   59% of NYU students demonstrating symptoms of depression reported that problems resulting from these symptoms had made it difficult forthem to do their schoolwork, take care of things at home, or get along with other people. 5   17.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing serious psychological distress in 2007. 5   8.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing a major depressive episode within the past year. 7   90% of college or university counseling center directors in the United States report an increase in psychological problems among their students. 7   The proportion of students, nationally, with a previous diagnosis of depression increased from 10% to 15% between 2000 and 2005. 8   75% of lifetime mental disorders have first onset by the typical college age range of 18-24. 9                                           Recommendations     Develop mental health outreach targeted to specific at-risk student groups to increase utilization of treatment.  Students from different backgrounds may experience greater levels of stigma toward mental health issues. For example, studies have shown that Asian international students - compared with American students - experience greater discomfort or shame with counseling, less openness to counseling, and a greater preference for a flexible counseling format. 10 Young adults who perceive public stigma surrounding mental illness are less likely to perceive a need to seek help. 11 This perception of stigma can contribute to underutilization of university mental health services, while concerns regarding language and culture can act as barriers to counseling. 10 New models advocate for a culturally sensitive continuity of care which tailors mental health outreach and services to diverse groups of people. 12 Ensuring that NYU\u2019s counseling services are culturally competent to accommodate the needs of a diverse student population is a necessity.       Raise student awareness of the impact of anxiety and depression on their ability to learn, function, and succeed.  Depression is a significant predictor of not only GPA but also the likelihood of withdrawing from the university. 1 Untreated depression is associated with a decrease ofa 0.49 point, or half a letter grade, in a student\u2019s grade point average. 13 In contrast, treatment for depression is correlated with a protective effect of 0.44 points. 13 Students who report greater psychological distress also tend to view themselves as less capable of succeeding, are more anxious about their class performance, 14 and possess lower self-efficacy and resource management skills. 13 With increased knowledge of the impact of mental health issues on their academic performance and college experience, students may be more likely to seek help or support.       Educate university staff and faculty about the impact of anxiety and depression on learning outcomes, ability to function, and student success.   By virtue of their interactions with students, university staff and faculty are uniquely positioned to have a positive impact on their students\u2019 mental health. Research has shown that when faculty and students are trained to recognize symptoms of depression, students may increase treatment-seeking behaviors. 15 Studies have emphasized the importance of training faculty and staff to understand the relationship between mental health and learning. 16 Additionally, graduate students who have functional relationships with their advisors are less prone to report emotional or stress-related problems. 17 Creating a university-wide culture and environment that encourages inclusiveness and support to augment campus mental health services has been recommended to improve outcomes for students. 16       Expand the development and utilization of holistic therapeutic interventions.  Evidence-based holistic interventions, such as biofeedback, art therapy, and music therapy have been shown to supplement traditional mental health treatments. Participation in the arts can benefit those with mental health difficulties, particularly increasing feelings of empowerment 18 and coping abilities. 19 Students using biofeedback in combination with relaxation techniques reported significantly lower anxiety and less mental and physical manifestations of stress than did those using relaxation techniques alone. 20 Music, as used by music therapists, has the potential to ameliorate the mental health of those with a variety of psychiatric conditions. 21 The expansion of holistic therapeutic intervention offerings may be particularly effective for students with emotional adjustment problems and serve to augment treatment for students with a mental health diagnosis.       Improve the coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community.  Fragmentation of the behavioral health service delivery system is noted as a significant obstacle to the receipt of quality mental health care. 22,23 Monitoring treatment compliance and efficacy among students diagnosed with depression using a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach among NYU primary care and counseling services as well as case management has been shown to ensure that students with mental health needs receive optimal treatment. 24 NYU students in need of long-term counseling are referred from Counseling and Wellness Services to high-quality clinicians in the community. Enhancing partnerships and improving coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community ensures that more students will receive effective and necessary mental health care.       Strengthen connections between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and student-run mental health interest groups and initiatives.   Student-run mental health initiatives, such as advocacy groups or peer-led education and support, are important components of suicide prevention and mental health promotion. Operating in conjunction with treatment, student mental health interest groups contribute to an atmosphere of inclusion and empowerment for mentally ill students. 25 Research suggests that when students become involved with student-run campus mental health awareness and/or advocacy groups, such as Active Minds, their attitudes of stigma toward mental illness decrease. 25 Furthermore, interpersonal contact between those with mental illness and those without is an effective strategy in reducing stigmatizing views of people with mental health issues. 25                                                           Indicator Technical Notes                               a) Engagement in mental health treatment among students who have seriously considered suicide     Data Source: ACHA #30J &amp; #31A1-31B7   Survey Questions: Have you ever seriously considered suicide? &amp; Within the last 12 months have you been diagnosed or treated by a professional for any of the following: anorexia; anxiety; ADHA; bipolar disorder; bulimia; depression; insomnia; other sleep disorder; OCD; panic attacks; phobia; schizophrenia; substance abuse or addiction; other addiction; other mental health condition?
