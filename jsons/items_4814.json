A/P/A Studies explores the histories,  experiences and cultural production of peoples of Asian or Pacific origins  living in and moving through the Americas. Our classes cross boundaries  between literature, history, visual culture, urban studies, legal studies,  and gender/sexuality studies, and connect the lives and concerns of local  communities to national and global dynamics.     Its faculty members, many of whom also operate as museologists, artists,  journalists and community activists, have a broad range of research  interests in the realm of APA Studies including contemporary piracy, the  fashion industry and avant-garde cinema. Classes, while open to everyone,  have traditionally been of particular interest to students majoring in  politics, East Asian studies, psychology, food studies, history, literature,  sociology. The Program is also a close partner of the A/P/A Institute. Learn more .
