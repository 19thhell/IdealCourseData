In this role, Bremmer will teach at the NYU Stern School of Business and will organize public events, including lectures and seminars, at the School of Business and at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies&rsquo; (NYU-SCPS) Center for Global Affairs. NYU President John Sexton said, &ldquo;We are pleased to name Ian Bremmer a Global Research Professor. His participation in campus life and discourse will powerfully contribute to NYU&rsquo;s intellectual vibrancy, and both his global outlook and experience are a good fit for a university whose unmatched global presence in major cities throughout the world is one of its defining characteristics. We proudly welcome him to the NYU community.&rdquo;  Peter Henry, dean of NYU Stern, commented, &ldquo;Ian Bremmer and the Eurasia Group set the standard of excellence for political risk analysis in business. In coming to teach at Stern, Ian brings significant experience to our classroom on the interplay between political risk, economic policy and growth, and helps us in our mission to prepare students for effective global engagement.&rdquo; Dennis Di Lorenzo, dean of NYU-SCPS, added, &ldquo;I am delighted that Ian Bremmer will participate, each year, in a major event for the Center for Global Affairs. His depth of knowledge and his ability to understand and to explain complex issues regarding political risk analysis will provide for a thoughtful and compelling exchange of ideas for our students and for the public at large.&quot; &ldquo;I plan to challenge students to address the intersection between political science and the marketplace &ndash; business and finance,&rdquo; said Bremmer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very excited to engage with the next generation of policy and business leaders in this process.&rdquo; Bremmer created Wall Street&rsquo;s first global political risk index and has authored several books, including the national bestsellers, E very Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World and The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations? He is a contributor for the Financial Times &ldquo;A-List&rdquo; and Reuters.com, and writes &ldquo;The Call&rdquo; blog on ForeignPolicy.com. He also has published articles in the Wall Street Journal , the Washington Post , the New York Times , Newsweek , Harvard Business Review , and Foreign Affairs . He appears regularly on CNBC, Fox News Channel, NPR, and other networks. Bremmer founded Eurasia Group in 1998 with just $25,000. Today, the company has offices in New York, Washington, D.C., and London, as well as a network of experts and resources around the world. Eurasia Group provides financial, corporate, and government clients with information and insight on how political developments move markets. Bremmer earned a Ph.D. in political science from Stanford University in 1994 and was the youngest-ever national fellow at the Hoover Institution. He previously taught at Columbia University and has held faculty positions at the EastWest Institute and the World Policy Institute. In 2007, he was named a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum. His analysis focuses on global macro political trends and emerging markets, which he defines as &ldquo;those countries where politics matter at least as much as economics for market outcomes.&rdquo; Contact: James Devitt               212.998.6808                james.devitt@nyu.edu                                                                                                                 News      NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights to Tackle Migrant Labor Rights in the Construction Industry    Foreign Policy Association Awards Medal to Dean Peter Henry    Follow @NYUStern on Twitter and like NYU Stern on Facebook         Basics      Directions &amp; Maps    Faculty Directory    Contact Us                                 FACULTY OPINIONS    Read Stern faculty opinions on  relevant business topics             Sitemap | Privacy | &copy; 2015 Leonard N.
