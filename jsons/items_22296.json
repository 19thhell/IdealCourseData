The graduate tax faculty includes several of the country\u2019s leading academic figures in taxation as well as tax practitioners who combine an extraordinary commitment to teaching with practical knowledge accumulated over years of experience at the most sophisticated levels of tax practice. Alumni of the program are found in prominent positions in tax practice, government, the judiciary and academia.   The program, offered on a full-time and part-time basis, is designed to provide a firm grounding in all of the major areas of federal taxation, offering over 50 graduate-level courses annually. While not an application requirement, students are expected to have taken a basic income taxation course before enrolling because all advanced tax classes take a rigorous approach to their material in order to effectively address the complexities of tax law. Going beyond a narrow, mechanical understanding, faculty emphasize theoretical and policy issues in locating responsible solutions to tax problems.   Focus on Curriculum   All full-time students will be assigned a faculty adviser to help them design a program of study. Students who wish to concentrate on areas of particular interest may follow suggested courses of study in:     General Taxation   Business Taxation   International Taxation (for US-trained attorneys)   Estate Planning   Tax Policy     In addition to these areas of concentration, a variety of courses are offered in other areas, such as state and local taxation, taxation of executive compensation, bankruptcy taxation, and civil and criminal tax procedure. More information regarding the suggested curricula and designing an individualized course from the various tax offerings is available from the Graduate Tax Program .   Programs for Practicing Lawyers   As the top program in the nation, the perpetual challenge is to be innovative, flexible and responsive to students\u2019 needs as well as the needs of the marketplace. For many years, practicing lawyers have enrolled in the LLM in Taxation on a part-time basis, benefitting from some evening classes taught by the nation\u2019s leading tax practitioners, the intensive tax courses offered by the Graduate Tax Program during the summer months, and some online classes. Also offered on a part-time basis are:     the Executive LLM in Taxation , which may be completed entirely online;   the Advanced Professional Certificate in Taxation , a 12-credit program of advanced tax classes in a specific area of concentration.

Please note that admissions deadlines differ for candidates with foreign credentials. The APC consists of a combination of related courses totaling at least 12 credits and not exceeding 14 credits. The APC in Taxation may be completed by students who wish to pursue only the Certificate, as well as students who have been admitted to the Part-time LLM in Taxation program.   Students may complete the program in one calendar year of part-time work. All APC requirements must be completed within four years. Since the APC consists of advanced courses, students must satisfy prerequisites. Many of the courses in the certificate programs may be available online. However, most states now regulate distance learning, and some states effectively restrict schools from offering small programs online. While the certificate programs are available to be completed online by New York residents, residents or domiciliaries of other states may not be able to complete these certificate programs online. Please contact the graduate tax program with any questions about this if you are a resident or domiciliary outside of New York state, and we can assess whether you can attend the program. The Advanced Professional Certificate programs are:     Corporate Taxation   The Corporate Taxation APC requires the following core courses:     Corporate Taxation I &amp; II   Taxation of Mergers and Acquisitions   Advanced Corporate Tax Problems (Students may request to substitute another advanced corporate tax course for ACTP)     Students then elect from the following offerings, pending availability:     Advanced Partnership Tax I   Advanced Partnership Tax II: Issues in Practice   Partnership Taxation   International Taxation I, II, &amp; III   Taxation of Financial Instruments   Taxation of Affiliated Corporations   Taxation of Private Equity Transactions   Taxation of Property Transactions       Estate Planning   The Estate Planning APC requires the following core courses:     Estate and Gift Taxation   Estate Planning   Income Taxation of Trusts and Estates     Students then elect from the following offerings, pending availability:     Advanced Partnership Tax   Corporate Taxation I &amp; II   Generation Skipping Transfer Tax   International Estate Planning   International Taxation I, II, &amp; III   Partnership Taxation   Tax Aspects of Charitable Giving   Tax Exempt Organizations   Taxation of Executive Compensation   Taxation of Property Transactions   Timing Issues and the Income Tax     International Taxation   The International Taxation APC requires the following core courses:     International Taxation I &amp; II     Students then elect from the following offerings, pending availability:     Advanced Corporate Tax Problem   Advanced Corporate Tax Problems: International   Advanced Partnership Tax I   Advanced Partnership Tax II: Issues in Practice   Corporate Taxation I &amp; II   International Taxation III   Partnership Taxation   Tax Treaties   Taxation of Property Transactions   Taxation of Mergers and Acquisitions   Transfer Pricing     State law restrictions and procedures   Please note that our online programs are not available in all states, and these certificate programs are only specifically authorized for online delivery to New York State residents. These certificates are not likely available in an online format in many other states. Some states have recently instituted complex registration requirements for out-of-state institutions. At this time we are unable to accept new distance-learning students who will undertake their studies from within the following seven states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Minnesota, Montana*, Oregon, and Wisconsin.   *We hope to complete Montana\u2019s authorization process soon and will update this list in the event we receive approval to educate Montana citizens.   Additionally, students from the following four states may enroll, but may not take examinations in these states: Delaware, Kentucky, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. Potential applicants from these states should contact John Stephens ( john.stephens@nyu.edu ) prior to applying to see if they are able to examine in these states either online or in-person under applicable state law. It may be possible for residents of these states to instead examine on campus in New York or from another state.   States may have unique complaint processes available, and a list of those can be found here , compiled by SHEEO (State Higher Education Executive Officers Association).

The graduate tax faculty includes several of the country\u2019s leading academic figures in taxation as well as tax practitioners who combine an extraordinary commitment to teaching with practical knowledge accumulated over years of experience at the most sophisticated levels of tax practice. Alumni of the program are found in prominent positions in tax practice, government, the judiciary and academia.   The program, offered on a full-time and part-time basis, is designed to provide a firm grounding in all of the major areas of federal taxation, offering over 50 graduate-level courses annually. While not an application requirement, students are expected to have taken a basic income taxation course before enrolling because all advanced tax classes take a rigorous approach to their material in order to effectively address the complexities of tax law. Going beyond a narrow, mechanical understanding, faculty emphasize theoretical and policy issues in locating responsible solutions to tax problems.   Focus on Curriculum   All full-time students will be assigned a faculty adviser to help them design a program of study. Students who wish to concentrate on areas of particular interest may follow suggested courses of study in:     General Taxation   Business Taxation   International Taxation (for US-trained attorneys)   Estate Planning   Tax Policy     In addition to these areas of concentration, a variety of courses are offered in other areas, such as state and local taxation, taxation of executive compensation, bankruptcy taxation, and civil and criminal tax procedure. More information regarding the suggested curricula and designing an individualized course from the various tax offerings is available from the Graduate Tax Program .   Programs for Practicing Lawyers   As the top program in the nation, the perpetual challenge is to be innovative, flexible and responsive to students\u2019 needs as well as the needs of the marketplace. For many years, practicing lawyers have enrolled in the LLM in Taxation on a part-time basis, benefitting from some evening classes taught by the nation\u2019s leading tax practitioners, the intensive tax courses offered by the Graduate Tax Program during the summer months, and some online classes. Also offered on a part-time basis are:     the Executive LLM in Taxation , which may be completed entirely online;   the Advanced Professional Certificate in Taxation , a 12-credit program of advanced tax classes in a specific area of concentration.

Please note that admissions deadlines differ for candidates with foreign credentials. The APC consists of a combination of related courses totaling at least 12 credits and not exceeding 14 credits. The APC in Taxation may be completed by students who wish to pursue only the Certificate, as well as students who have been admitted to the Part-time LLM in Taxation program.   Students may complete the program in one calendar year of part-time work. All APC requirements must be completed within four years. Since the APC consists of advanced courses, students must satisfy prerequisites. Many of the courses in the certificate programs may be available online. However, most states now regulate distance learning, and some states effectively restrict schools from offering small programs online. While the certificate programs are available to be completed online by New York residents, residents or domiciliaries of other states may not be able to complete these certificate programs online. Please contact the graduate tax program with any questions about this if you are a resident or domiciliary outside of New York state, and we can assess whether you can attend the program. The Advanced Professional Certificate programs are:     Corporate Taxation   The Corporate Taxation APC requires the following core courses:     Corporate Taxation I &amp; II   Taxation of Mergers and Acquisitions   Advanced Corporate Tax Problems (Students may request to substitute another advanced corporate tax course for ACTP)     Students then elect from the following offerings, pending availability:     Advanced Partnership Tax I   Advanced Partnership Tax II: Issues in Practice   Partnership Taxation   International Taxation I, II, &amp; III   Taxation of Financial Instruments   Taxation of Affiliated Corporations   Taxation of Private Equity Transactions   Taxation of Property Transactions       Estate Planning   The Estate Planning APC requires the following core courses:     Estate and Gift Taxation   Estate Planning   Income Taxation of Trusts and Estates     Students then elect from the following offerings, pending availability:     Advanced Partnership Tax   Corporate Taxation I &amp; II   Generation Skipping Transfer Tax   International Estate Planning   International Taxation I, II, &amp; III   Partnership Taxation   Tax Aspects of Charitable Giving   Tax Exempt Organizations   Taxation of Executive Compensation   Taxation of Property Transactions   Timing Issues and the Income Tax     International Taxation   The International Taxation APC requires the following core courses:     International Taxation I &amp; II     Students then elect from the following offerings, pending availability:     Advanced Corporate Tax Problem   Advanced Corporate Tax Problems: International   Advanced Partnership Tax I   Advanced Partnership Tax II: Issues in Practice   Corporate Taxation I &amp; II   International Taxation III   Partnership Taxation   Tax Treaties   Taxation of Property Transactions   Taxation of Mergers and Acquisitions   Transfer Pricing     State law restrictions and procedures   Please note that our online programs are not available in all states, and these certificate programs are only specifically authorized for online delivery to New York State residents. These certificates are not likely available in an online format in many other states. Some states have recently instituted complex registration requirements for out-of-state institutions. At this time we are unable to accept new distance-learning students who will undertake their studies from within the following seven states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Minnesota, Montana*, Oregon, and Wisconsin.   *We hope to complete Montana\u2019s authorization process soon and will update this list in the event we receive approval to educate Montana citizens.   Additionally, students from the following four states may enroll, but may not take examinations in these states: Delaware, Kentucky, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. Potential applicants from these states should contact John Stephens ( john.stephens@nyu.edu ) prior to applying to see if they are able to examine in these states either online or in-person under applicable state law. It may be possible for residents of these states to instead examine on campus in New York or from another state.   States may have unique complaint processes available, and a list of those can be found here , compiled by SHEEO (State Higher Education Executive Officers Association).
