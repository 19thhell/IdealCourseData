Are they indeed anchored in the sexual dynamics of the human family as argued by Freud, or are they a necessary stage in humanity\u2019s cultural formation as suggested by Girard et al (Violent Origins)? Moreover, how do biblical gender/sexual roles and the implementation of violence within them differ from those of the analogous Greco-Christian tradition and its 20th-century heir \u2013 Freudian psychoanalysis? What are the psychological and ethical implications of the differences between the biblical account of the first homicidal act (Cain and Able) and the classical Greek take on homicide in The Orestea or Oedipus Rex? These are some of the questions to be discussed in this class through a comparative close reading of selected biblical narratives and Greek myth and drama, accompanied by relevant assignments from biblical, classical Greek, and psychoanalytic scholarship; literary and feminist interpretation of the Bible; and artistic representations of biblical and classic Greek themes. The Dead Sea Scrolls, Judaism, and Christianity (HBRJD-UA 131) [Ancient/Rabbinic] Instructor: Prof. Alex Jassen Day &amp; Time: Thursday 12:30pm - 1:45pm Description: Survey of the importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls for the history of early Judaism and Christianity.

Conceptions of Gender in Ancient Egypt (HBRJD-UA 138 ) [Ancient/Rabbinic] Instructor: Prof. Ann Roth Day &amp; Time: Thursday 12:30pm - 1:45pm Description: The pharaonic Egyptian culture (3100 \u2013 30 BCE) was situated geographically in an unusual agriculture zone, dependent not upon rain and irrigation, but on an annual flood that left the land fertilized and well-watered. As a result, general conceptions of fertility, and hence gender, were somewhat anomalous. This course will deal with this hypothesis, and the traditional scholarship on Egyptian gender relations and sexuality, by examining archaeological remains, artistic representations, and texts throughout the pharaonic period. Russian Jewish History (HBRJD-UA 191) [Modern] Instructor: Prof. Gennady Estraikh Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm Description: Focuses on Jewish history in imperial Russia, from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 20th. It also gives an overview of the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. Topics include the government's policies toward Jews; attempts to integrate them into the larger society; the establishment and development of Russian Jewish civil society; Jewish participation in the revolutionary movement; aspects of Jewish social, economic, and cultural life in villages, town, and cities; the role of women in family and communal life; military service; anti-Jewish violence; and emigration. Israeli Politics and Society (HBRJD-UA 710) [Modern] Instructor: TBA Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 3:30pm \u2013 4:45 pm Description: Examines the power structure and mechanisms of contemporary Israeli politics beginning with the emergence of the provisional government in 1948.

Readings in Talmud: Hullin VIII (in Hebrew) (HBRJD-UA 784) Instructor: Prof. Lawrence Schiffman Day &amp; Time: Tuesday 6:30pm \u2013 8:00pm Description: Studies a selected section of the Hebrew and Aramaic text of the Babylonian Talmud, utilizing both traditional and academic methods of study.\u200e Emphasis is on mastering the themes and concepts while studying the text and its commentaries in depth. CORE Courses  Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Reformation (CORE-UA 400-070) Instructor: Prof. Mark Smith Day &amp; Time: Tuesday, Thursday 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm Description: Often viewed as a series of \"Protestant\" responses to the Roman Catholic   Church, the Reformation was a period of massive religious and political   conflict. It appropriated the Bible as the single basis of   authoritative knowledge and also transformed the study of the Bible   based on the language and textual scholarship that had emerged in the   wake of the Renaissance\u2019s rediscovery of classical texts. In taking up   the Bible as well as classical learning, the Reformation posed   fundamental questions about the nature of individual persons, society,   and humanity. These issues continue to inform fundamental ideas and   conceptual categories of religion and society in Western Europe and the   United States today. Ancient Israel (CORE-UA 514-001) Instructor: Prof. Daniel Fleming Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm Description: The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 BCE to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century BCE. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel (CORE-UA 537-001) Instructor: Prof. Ronald Zweig Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm Description: Explores the cultural values and expressions through which residents of the modern State of Israel have tried to come to grips with the manifold challenges their country has faced since its inception in 1948. Its founders envisioned citizens would initiate extensive changes in their economic and political behavior, family life, attitudes toward their bodies, relations with their neighbors, religious outlook, and view of their place in the world, and expected that these would find concrete expression in literature, art, music, architecture, and intellectual life. But they did not anticipate the challenges of rapid mass immigration, periodic wars, shifting geopolitical alignments, transformation of the global economy, and sweeping technological innovations. We analyze these far-reaching changes in the context in which Israeli culture has functioned and investigate how that culture has responded to them, drawing on journalistic accounts, short stories, and Israeli films and television programs.
