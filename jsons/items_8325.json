Have fun with them!        Date    Email content        1/21/15    For those of you who were in my corporate finance class, the torture begins again ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7edeOEuXdMU ). For those of you who are new to this experience, you will soon find out... I am sure that you are finding that break is passing by way too fast, but the semester is almost upon us and I want to welcome you to the Valuation class. One of the best things about teaching this class is that valuation is always timely (and always fun...) Just as examples: Is it time to buy or sell Twitter? Is Uber worth $40 billion? Is there a market bubble? What is the value added by the Kardashian sisters? Are the Dallas Cowboys really worth more than the New York Yankees? If you have not visited my blog, I put my thoughts down on these issues (though I am still working on the Kardashian valuation):    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/    1. Preclass work: I know that some of you are worried about the class but relax! If you can add, subtract, divide and multiply, you are pretty much home free... If you want to get a jump on the class, you can go to the class web page:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/equity.html    2. Syllabus &amp; Calendar: The syllabus for the class is available on the website for the class and there is a google calendar for the class that you can get to by clicking on     http://bit.ly/1xfQ1ov    For those of you already setting up your calendars, it lists when the quizzes will be held and when projects come due.    3. Lecture notes: The first set of lecture notes for the class should be available in the bookstore by the start of next week. If you want to save some money, they can also be printed off online (if you want to save some paper, you can print two slides per page and double sided). To get to the lecture notes, you can try     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/eqlect.htm    Please download and print only the first packet on discounted cashflow valuation. If you want to save paper, you can download the pdf file on you iPad, Android or Kindle and follow along...    4. Delivery choices: I hope to see you all in class for every session, but there are three supporting delivery mechanisms that I would like you to take advantage of:    a. Yellowdig: I don&rsquo;t much care for NYU classes and use it sparingly. I am trying out a new service called Yellowdig that combines social media, content and commentary.     https://www.yellowdig.com    You should be getting an invite to join the class. Please accept the invite.    b. iTunes U: I will also be posting the material for the class on iTunes U. If you have never used iTunes U, you need an Apple device (iPad or iPhone) and have to download the iTunes U app (free). Once you have the app, use the link below:     https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/valuation-spring-2015/id959944561    I really like the set up and I think you may enjoy it too.    c. YouTube Channel: There is a final option, if your broadband connection is not that great and you are watching on a Tablet/smartphone. There is a YouTube playlist for this class, where all class sessions will be loaded.     http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkh9m2BorqlC9L22LncmXWf_GPbBtScc    When you get a chance, check it out.    5. Books for the class: The best book for the class is the Investment Valuation book - the third edition. (If you already have the second edition, don't waste your money. It should work...) You can get it at Amazon or wait and get it at the book store... If you are the law-abiding type, you can buy &quot;Damodaran on Valuation&quot; - make sure that you are getting the second edition. If you can get the Asian edition, even better. It is exactly the same book and costs about a third. Or, as a third choice, you can try The Dark Side of Valuation, again the second edition, if you are interested in hard to value companies.. Or if you are budget and time constrained, try &quot;The Little Book of Valuation&quot;. http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/public.htm    6. Valuation apps: One final note. I worked with Anant Sundaram (at Dartmouth) isn developing a valuation app for the iPad or iPhone that you can download on the iTunes store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uvalue/id440046276?mt=8   It comes with a money back guarantee... Sorry, no Android version yet... As for Blackberry, fuggedaboutit... Dead technology walking!!! I am looking forward to seeing you in a few days (The first day of class is February 2, 2015. I think we are going to have a lot of fun (at least, I am... ).        1/28/15    Just a few quick notes leading into next week's class.    1. Please make sure that you got my email from last week. If you joined the class this week or just don't read class related emails during your break, you can find the entire email by going to     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/eqemail.html    2. Please do accept the invite to the class on Yellowdig that I sent you last week. ( https://www.yellowdig.com/board/Valuation+Spring+2015 )    3. Visit the website for the class and check out the Google calendar to make sure that you don't have any quiz conflicts:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/equity.html    Finally, we don't have to wait until next week to start talking about valuation, right? So, what do you think about the chaos in the currency market and how it is affecting stocks? What about oil prices? Lots to think about before class on Monday. Look forward to seeing you in KMEC 2-60 from 1.30-2.50 on February 2. Until next time!        2/1/15    As we get ready for class tomorrow, I think you my find this post that I put on my blog today useful in giving you a sense of what this class is about and what it is not about.    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/02/discounted-cashflow-valuations-dcf.html   I am going to post it on Yellowdig and you can add your own views (which can be different from mine). If you have not accepted your invite to Yellowdig and cannot find it, I will send out another invite tonight. I will see you tomorrow in KMEC 2-60 at 1.30 pm. Game on! (Superbowl, I mean!)        2/2/15    First, a quick note about today's class. During the session, I told you that that this was a class about valuation in all of its many forms &ndash; different approaches (intrinsic, relative &amp; contingent claim), different forums (for acquisitions, value enhancement, investing) and across different types of businesses (private &amp; public, small and large, developed &amp; emerging market). After spending some time laying out the script for the class (quizzes, exams, weekly tortures), I started on the intro to valuation by giving you my reasons for doing valuation (to fight looming lemingitis) and starting on the discussion of widely held misconceptions about valuations.    With that out of the way, have you classified yourself yet? Are you a proud lemming, a &quot;Yogi bear&quot; lemming or a lemming with a life-vest? While you are pondering that life-changing question, I do have some points to make:   &bull; Please do find a group to nurture your valuation creativity, and a company to value soon. If you are ostracized, please let me know...   &bull; Once you pick a company, collect information on the company. I would start off on the company's own website and download the annual report for the most recent year (probably 2012) and then visit the SEC website (http://www.sec.gov) (for US listings) and download 10Q filings. (You can pick any publicly traded company anywhere in the world to value. The non-US company that you value can have ADRs (but does not have to have ADRs) listed in the US but you still have to value it in the local currency and local market. You can even analyze a private company, if you can take responsibility for collecting the information.)   &bull; The web cast for the first class are up and running (or at least the streaming version). You can access it by going to:     http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/9f47a09c1e0c4608a1382558f8b02caa1d    The links to iTunes U and Yellowdig have not been posted yet, since I don't have the downloadable video file link yet.   &bull; Post class test: To review what we did in class today, I prepared a very simple post-class test. I have attached it, with the solution. Give it your best shot.    If you did not get the syllabus, project description and the valuation intro in class this morning, they are all available to print off from this site.    Sorry about the length of this email, but there will be more to come (I promise!).    Attachments: Post-class test and solution .        2/3/15    I hope that the sun outside is cheering you up and I hope that this email is not a downer. Two very quick notes before I leave you to your own devices. First, the first valuation of the week is up and I hope that you get a chance to do it. Uber, as you undoubtedly know, is the superstar of the car-sharing/tech space, attracting venture capital money at an almost unstoppable clip, It's value estimate has surged from a billion to $17 billion to $41 billion in the span of a year, which raises a valuation question. Is it worth that much? In this weekly challenge, I argue that the value that you attach to Uber is very much a function of what you think its business is (a car service company, a logistics company or a transportation company?), what type of networking advantages it will have in this business and its competitive advantages. You can start the challenge with this blog post that I had last month:     http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/12/up-up-and-away-crowd-valuation-of-uber.html    Follow it up by taking a look at the spreadsheet that I created for the company, where you can choose your narrative points and come up with a value.    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/uberDec14.xls    Feel free to make your choices and come up with your own estimate of value. Once you have it, please go to this Google shared spreadsheet and share your estimate.    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xlLMLSxNZOFjnol110WkrWSmEm378swfz5C4hu6J778/edit#gid=0    Let's get this going!    Second, the webcasts links are all up and running. Even if you were in class yesterday, pick your preferred link and try it out. You never know when you may need it:    Webcast page for the class for Stream, downloadable video and downloadable audio: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm    iTunes U: https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/id959944561    Yellowdig: https://www.yellowdig.com/board/Valuation+Spring+2015    YouTube: http://youtu.be/l4Vb6mJqURs    Second, please work on becoming part of a group and picking a company. They don&rsquo;t have to be sequential. It is true that some of you (law students, EMBAs, Langone MBAs) may have trouble finding a group. I have created a Google shared spreadsheet of Valuation Orphans where you can meet.    https://docs.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1aRV7UVM1Nh-x4rurEA-92mN73BFhoypD9lnhHKnoNkY/edit?usp=sharing        2/4/15    As I mentioned in Monday&rsquo;s class, we will start each class with a simple test, previewing what we will be covering during the class. While this may seem ass-backwards, it is meant to illustrate a simple fact. Most of the time, you will be able to reason your way to the right answer, even before we unveil it in class, and when you do not, it is useful to examine why. While I will usually not send you the start of the class ahead of time, I decided to do so today because I would like you to spend some time (say 5-10 minutes) thinking about it. So, please give the attached test a scan before class today. See you in class!    Attachments: biastests.pdf        2/4/15    Today's class started with a test on whether you can detect the direction bias will take, based on who or why a valuation is done. The solutions are posted online. We then moved on to talk about the three basic approaches to valuation: discounted cash flow valuation, where you estimate the intrinsic value of an asset, relative valuation, where you value an asset based on the pricing of similar assets and option pricing valuation, where you apply option pricing to value businesses. With each approach, we talked about the types of assets that are best priced with that approach and what you need to bring as an analyst/investor to the table. For instance, in our discussion of DCF valuation and how to make it work for you, I suggested that there were two requirements: a long time horizon and the capacity to act as the catalyst for market correction. Since I mentioned Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman as hostile acquirers (catalysts), you may want to look at Herbalife, the company that Ackman has targeted as being over valued and Icahn did for being under valued. See if you can get a list going of how he is trying to be the catalyst for the correction... and think about the dark side of this process.       Speaking about input fatigure, I am attaching the link to a New York Times piece on decision fatigue. It is a fun and interesting read. Please take a look at it, when you get a chance:    http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?pagewanted=all   We ended the class today with the question of whether equity valued directly (by discounting cash flows to equity at the cost of equity) will yield the same value as equity valued indirectly (by valuing the firm and subtracting out debt). i know that we really have not delved into valuation in depth, but if you are up to it, try the first weekly challenge (which is attached). When you are done, go into NYU Classes (it is the only time I will use NYU classes) and submit your answer. I will give you mine on Sunday. I am also attaching the post class test and solution for the session.    Attachments: Post-class test and solution .        2/5/15    It is never too early to start nagging you about the project. So, let me get started with a checklist (which is short for this week but will get longer each week. Here is the list of things that would be nice to get behind you:    Find a group: If you have trouble finding one, try the orphan spreadsheet for the class. ( https://docs.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1aRV7UVM1Nh-x4rurEA-92mN73BFhoypD9lnhHKnoNkY/edit?usp=sharing )    Pick a company: This will require some coordination across the group to make sure that you meet the minimum criteria (at least one money loser, high growth, emerging market, service company)    Find the most recent annual report for your company.    If your company has quarterly reports or filings pull them up as well.    In doing all of this, you will need data and Stern subscribes to one of the two industry standards: S&amp;P Capital IQ (the other is Factset). It is truly a remarkable dataset with hundreds of items on tens of thousands of public companies listed globally, including corporate governance measures. However, to use Capital IQ, you have to enroll and this is an email I got earlier this week about enrolling. Please, please register now. You will not regret it and it will not only save you lots of time in the future but will give you another weapon you can use in analysis.    Professor Damodaran,    My office has sent the below message to your department for distribution, but I wanted to make sure that you have this information, since I know you have incorporated Capital IQ into your coursework in the past.    The enrollment period for spring semester Capital IQ accounts is currently underway. If you are planning to have your MBA students use Capital IQ this semester, please let your students know they have from now until February 25th to request spring semester accounts by filling out the Capital IQ form on their Career Account. Please note that even if students will need Capital IQ for projects later on in the semester, they will need to request access during this official enrollment period at the beginning of the semester.    For non-MBA Stern students, there are 10 Capital IQ-enabled terminals on campus that do not require a Capital IQ account. The undergraduate terminals are located in the computer bank near Stair Y on the LC level, and the graduate terminals are located on the 5th floor of KMC outside Suite 5-100. Capital IQ is accessed by clicking the Capital IQ bookmark in Firefox or a different browser.       Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about Capital IQ access,        2/6/15    I know that many of you still pondering your company choices and group dynamics, but if and when you pick a company, the first step is to get the raw material you need for your valuation. These include data on the company (annual reports, regulatory filings like the 10K/10Q), sector wide data (numbers for other companies in your sector) and macro economic data. I know that many of you already know exactly how to do this. However, if you feel uncertain, you can try this webcast out.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/gettingdata.mp4    Incidentally, I do talk about using Capital IQ to get sector wide information in this webcast.    On a different note, a couple of reminders of notes that I have already sent out. First, the valuation of the week (Uber) and the shared google spreadsheet await you. You can find the full details on the webcast page for the class:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm   Give it a shot, when you get a chance. Second, the weekly challenge was posted (and emailed to you) a couple of days ago. I will post my solution on Sunday, but please try it out before then. To submit your answer on NYU classes, here is what you will need to do. Log into NYU classes and click on assignments. You will see the first weekly challenge up there. Come up with your answer and submit it here. You are off to the races.        2/7/15    Just a quick hit and run. Your first newsletter is attached. No real news to report, especially if you were in class, but no harm checking it out. Have a great weekend!    Attachments: Newsletter #1        2/8/15    First things first. This week, we will be delving into the mechanics of discount rates, starting with the risk free rate and then moving on to the equity risk premium. They are both central to valuation and we live in unusual times, where the former, in particular, is doing strange things. Additionally. I hope that you had a chance to try the first weekly challenge. If you did, you can check your solution against mine. Even if you did not, you can try the challenge now (or in the near future) and check out the solution.    Finally, we will be starting off tomorrow's class with the question of firm versus equity valuation. I am attaching the cash flow table that we will be using for the start-of-the-class test as well. If you get a chance, please take a look at it before you come into class.    Attachments: Weekly Challenge Solution , Start of the class test        2/9/15    Today's class started with a look at a major investment banking valuation of a target company in an acquisition and why having a big name on a valuation does not always mean that a valuation follows first principles. After setting the table for the key inputs that drive value - cash flows, growth, risk, we looked at the process for estimating the cost of equity in a valuation. The key concept is that of a &quot;marginal&quot; investor, who is diversified and looking at risk through that investor's eyes. We spent the rest of the session talking about what should be (but no longer is) the simplest input into the process: the risk free rate.    I hope that the discussion of riskfree rates a left you fairly clear about what to do next. In case, you are still confused, this is the next step in the process:    1. Pick a company (in case you have not already).    2. Determine a currency that you will value the company in. Once you have decided on the currency, find a riskfree rate in that currency. If your company is a US or European company, you just got lucky. Either take the easy way out and use the US T.Bond rate as the dollar riskfree rate and the German 10-year bond rate as the Euro riskfree rate, or adjust them for the default risk you see in each sovereign.    If you are valuing a company in an emerging market in the local currency (be brave), your job is a little more complicated.    2a. Get the longest term government bond rate you can get in the local currency. You can check out the Economist (look at the tables towards the end of the publication and at the long term interest rate). You can also try this site for long term local currency government bond rates:    http://www.tradingeconomics.com/bonds    2b. Get the local currency rating for the country by going to the moody's web site: http://www.moodys.com (Look under sovereign ratings). Estimate the default spread given the rating by downloading the country default spread spreadsheet that you can find at the link below    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/ctryprem.xls    2c. If you prefer to get CDS spreads, use the current CDS spreads that I have as an attachment (I will post both under the webcast page fand on the coursekit page as well)    2d. Riskless Rate = Government bond rate - Default Spread given rating    I have a paper on riskfree rates that elaborates on the discussion in class today. It is really not a painful read, if you can spare the time. You can get to it by going to:     http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1317436    I also have a follow-up paper on the &quot;What if&quot; series.. what if nothing is riskfree     http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1648164    Finally, I did a post on my blog specifically on the question of the risk free rate being low and the implications for valuaton:     http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2011/09/risk-free-rates-and-value-dealing-with.html    The topic seems to have acquired some followers among appraisers/analysts. This article provides a reasonable synopsis of where they stand:     http://www.hl.com/email/pdf/FW_Sep2011.pdf   The post class test and solution are also attached.    Attachments: Post-class test and solution .        2/10/15    This week&rsquo;s valuation is of a very different company from last week&rsquo;s, from the pinnacles of hope (Uber) to the valley of despair (Petrobras). It is a fascinating case study in how to destroy a company quickly, a perverse exercise in doing everything that you can do wrong in corporate finance. Start with the blog post:     http://bit.ly/1z5Po1D    Once you have read it, try the excel spreadsheet that contains the valuation:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/PBR2015.xls    When you have tried your hand at it, then go to the shared Google spreadsheet and give me your views;    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vBtn9QkFZCvKHi7tzbJnoirmwYOzGZG2VSD5kIMXFk/edit?usp=sharing   Hope you get a chance to try it.    Attachment: Petrobras Valuation        2/11/15    We are little more than halfway through the discussion of equity risk premiums but the contours of the discussion should be clear.    a. Historical equity risk premiums are not only backward looking but are noisy (have high standard errors). You can the historical return data for the US on my website by going to    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/data.html    Click on current data, and look to the top of the table of downloadable data items.    b. Country risk premium: The last few months should be a reminder of why country risk is not diversifiable. As you see markets are volatile around the world, I think you have a rationale for a country risk premium. You can get default spreads for country bonds on my site under updated data. If you are interested in assessing and measuring country risk, to get from default spreads to equity risk premiums, you need two more numbers. The first is the standard deviation for the equity market in the country that you are trying to estimate the premium for. Try the Bloomberg terminal. Find the equity index for the country in question (Bovespa for Brazil, Merval for Argentina etc.) and type in HVT. This should give you the annualized standard deviation in the index - change the default to weekly and use the 100-week standard deviation. Do the same for the country bond in question. The two standard deviations should yield the relative volatility. If you have trouble finding either number, just multiply the default spread by 1.5 to get a rough measure of the country risk premium.    As for other sites that look at country risk, here is one that you may want to look at. It is the site maintained by Professor Campbell Harvey at Duke who does very good work on country risk:     http://www.duke.edu/~charvey/Country_risk/couindex.htm    If you want my estimates of country risk premiums, check under updated data on my website. The direct link is below:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/ctryprem.xls    On the same theme, the weekly challenge for this week will let you work your way through the country risk premium numbers on your own.    c. Company risk exposure to country risk: My concept of lambdas for countries is a work in progress. I have a paper on the topic that you can read, if you are so inclined:     http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=889388    d. Implied equity risk premiums: I know that we barely touched this concept in class today, but its is not rocket science and I am sure that you can work with it. I am attaching the excel spreadsheet that will allow you to compute implied equity risk premiums. I am using the numbers that I used at the start of February to come up with an equity risk premium of 6.01%.    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/implprem/ERPFeb15.xls    Please try to update the implied premium, using today's numbers for the S&amp;P 500 (easy) and the 10-year T.Bond rate (easy). Leave everything else untouched including growth rate in earnings for next five years &amp; updated dividends and buybacks from the spreadsheet (since these were updated a month ago). Follow the instructions to get the updated equity risk premium. We will explore it further in class a week from today (since there is no class on Monday).    The post class test and solution are attached.    Attachments: Post-class test and solution .        2/12/15    I hope the week was a good (and productive one). Next week is a short week, since we have no class on Monday. Just to prod you (and harass you), I want to check on where you are on the project. Assuming that you have picked a company, joined a group and downloaded the financials, I had suggested after Monday's class that you estimate a riskfree rate in the currency that you will be doing the valuation in. If you have doubts about how to do this, the weekly challenge for this week will be a good way to test your understanding. It is online in the usual spots (webcast page and iTunes U) and is attached to this email. As with the first weekly challenge, you should be able to submit it on NYU classes. By the way, if you do have a chance, give the Petrobras valuation (on webcast page) a few minutes of your time as well....    Once you have a risk free rate, here are your next few steps:    Get a geographical breakdown of the countries/regions of the world that your company operates in. It should be in your annual report or financial disclosure forms somewhere. If you cannot, them's the breaks...    Get the total equity risk premium and country risk premium for the countries/regions: If you want to do this yourself, the weekly challenge will give you a template. If you want to take a short cut and use my estimates of country risk premiums, that is fine too.    Get a weighted average of the country risk premiums: You can use revenue weights of the country/region to compute the weighted average.    Finally, I hope you have had a chance of updating the implied equity risk premium spreadsheet that I sent you with Wednesday's email. All you have to do is update the S&amp;P 500 and the US treasury bond rate and use the goal seek (instructions on spreadsheet).    Attachments: Weekly Challenge #2        2/13/15    As you get ready for the long weekend, a couple of quick notes:    1. Implied ERP: In case you have a chance to try out the implied ERP spreadsheet (attached again to this email), I put together a short webcast (20 minutes) on both the mechanics of the implied ERP (using the February 2014 version of the spreadsheet) and how I get the numbers for the spreadsheet. I hope you get a chance to look at the webcast (and any feedback on making these webcasts more useful will be appreciated):    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/ImpliedERP.mp4    Presentation: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/ERP/ImpliedERP.ppt    Spreadsheet: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/implprem/ERPFeb14.xls    I have also put the links up on my webcast page(and Yellowdig &amp; iTunes U) for the data on buybacks and earnings growth.    2. Musk&rsquo;s narrative: In spite of my bearish views on Tesla, I have always liked Elon Musk for his charisma and vision. In fact, he has often been much more reasonable about Tesla&rsquo;s growth prospects that some of his more rabid fans (who also happen to be Tesla stockholders). Thus, I was surprised to read this:     http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2015/02/12/tesla-motors-could-reach-apples-market-cap-levels-ceo-musk-says/?mod=WSJ_LatestHeadlines    I especially focused on his rationale for why Tesla could be worth as much as Apple in 10 years. Quoting Musk, &ldquo;If you take this year&rsquo;s revenue, around $6 billion or thereabout, and if we&rsquo;re able to maintain a 50% growth rate for 10 years and achieve 10% profitability number and have a 20 (price-to-earnings ratio), our market cap would be basically the same as Apple&rsquo;s is today&rdquo;. Remember we talked about narratives and how they can spill out of control, if you are not disciplined. This is about as absurd a set of presumptions that I have seen strung together in one sentence. Food for thought!    3. Review Sessions: If you are having trouble keeping up with the class or working through the concepts, the TAs will be running review sessions every week on Wednesdays from 4.30-5.30 in 2-90. To attend these sessions, please sign up in the shared Google spreadsheet that has been set up for the purpose.   https://docs.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1kjszWGZqmwwl_2-bx3MWM0B6tjT6JZx4oGbcDfg5Kjg/edit#gid=0        2/14/15    Last week, we put the basics of valuation behind us and started on the nuts and bolts. In particular, we spent Monday talking about how to estimate risk free rates in different currencies and why they may be different. On Wednesday, we looked at equity risk premiums, talked about why historical risk premiums may be flawed and how to estimate equity risk premiums in other markets. Next week, we will have only one session and will examine a different way of thinking about equity risk premiums and also talk about alternatives to measuring the relative risk in a stock. I know that this is a long weekend and I hope you have fun. However, please do find a group, pick a company, estimate a risk free rate in the currency of your choice and start thinking about the ERP for your company. ( What a fun sucker? I know.. I know.. That is what my kids call me too&hellip;)    Attachments: Newsletter #2        2/15/15    I will keep this short. The solution to the second weekly challenge is attached, with the challenge. If you did not get a chance to do it, you can still try it. Next week is going to be a short one, since we have no class tomorrow. On Tuesday, I will still put up my valuation of the week and on Wednesday, we will look at how to estimate implied equity risk premiums and estimating the relative risk of a company. If you have picked a company, try to find a beta for your company from a service and bring it to class with you. Other than that, not much more to do. Have a wonderful rest of the weekend.    Attachments: Weekly Challenge #2 Solution        2/17/15    I hope that you had a productive weekend (or at least a fun one). Well, it is time to get back to work and to celebrate. I usually don&rsquo;t repeat valuations of the week, but I decided to make an exception this week, since this merger is one that we have all heard about (and have opinions about). A year ago, almost to the day, I posted my assessment of the Comcast/TWC deal. You can begin by reading the news story of the deal as it happened in February 2014:     http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-12/comcast-said-to-agree-to-pay-159-a-share-for-time-warner-cable.html    I posted this on my blog on February 18, 2014:    http://bit.ly/1ht9ejW    You get the summary data, as of February 2014, for the two companies at the link below:    Comcast Summary data: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/ComcastSummary.pdf    TWC Summary data: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/TWCSummary.pdf    The spreadsheet containing my valuation of synergy is at the link below:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/TWCComcast.xls    It is a year later and the merger that looked like a sure thing a year ago is faltering:     http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/02/02/investors-concern-mounting-over-time-warner-cable-comcast-deal/    I know that the numbers have changed for the two companies, as have the risk free rate and equity risk premium. I updated all of the numbers in this spreadsheet:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/TWCComcast2015.xls    If you get a chance, give the synergy spreadsheet a shot and when you are done, go into this shared Google spreadsheet and give me your assessments on what you think of this merger (that now may not go through):    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ujtm0jqYS9LggLliovwBH7W-gfSFbYuxdy64oCVWukg/edit?usp=sharing        2/18/15    By now, you are probably tired of equity risk premiums and I don't blame you. Today's session, though, was all about implied equity risk premiums and what causes them to change over time. Other things remaining equal, higher stock prices, higher cash flows and higher expected growth all push up the ERP, whereas a higher riskfree rate pushed the ERP down. If you get a chance, please play with the equity risk premium spreadsheet to check for yourself.    As for the inputs into the model, there is not much suspense. Here is where you can get them:    a. Level of the index: Almost everywhere    b. Cash flows on the index: For the S&amp;P 500, I go to the source:    http://www.standardandpoors.com    Click on the S&amp;P 500 and then on index announcements. The most recent release on the buybacks/dividends on the index should be there somewhere. The only problem is that S&amp;P updates these numbers on December 15, March 15, June 15 and September 15. So, you will have to leave the numbers unchanged during those months where there are no updates.    You have a choice on which cash flows to use in computing your premium: Current (trailing 12 month), average over last 5 years, average over last 10 years.    c. Expected growth rate: The easy route is to do what we did in class and get the data from Yahoo! Finance, where you will find it in any company's Yahoo page (under analyst estimates at the bottom of the page ). The better way to get it is to find a Bloomberg terminal, find the index in question (S&amp;P 500 in this case) and type in EE. You will get expected earnings at least for the next 2 years and you can extrapolate from there.    d. Riskfree rate: Use the ten-year default free rate in the currency in which your expected growth/cash flows are denominated. For the S&amp;P 500, this would be the 10-year US treasury bond rate.    If you want to carry forward and compare the equity risk premium to the bond default spread, here are the places you can go to get those numbers:    a. For the bond default spreads, visit my favorite macro data source (FRED, the Federal Reserve data site in St. Louis)    http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/    Click on categories first, then on interest rates and then on corporate bond rates. Finally, click on Moody's. You will see Baa rates going back to 1919 (Isn't that awesome?) You have to subtract out the ten-year bond rate and if you want to get that, you should find that on FRED as well. There is a iPhone and iPad app for FRED that you should download. It is free and you can download directly into Excel...    b. For the cap rates, you should try this site:    http://www.realtyrates.com/commentaryg.htm l    I am sure that there are better sources, but most of them require you to pay money. I am cheap..    If after all of this, you still want to read more about equity risk premiums, here is the link to my magnum opus (or something opus), the annual update I do on equity risk premiums:     http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2409198    Download the paper and browse through it. You will see much that is familiar. (The 2015 edition should be out in the next two weeks)   As for betas, the key thing to recognize is that it is a means to an end: a way of adjusting for relative risk. So, keep your eyes on the prize and don't let your disdain for modern portfolio theory get in the way of adjusting for risk and estimating value. The post class test and solution are attached.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        2/19/15    We spent much of today&rsquo;s sessions talking about equity risk premiums, how they have moved over time, both on their own and in relation to other variables such as the risk free rate, the corporate bond default spread and real estate cap rates. The best way to see the relationship is for you to look at the data yourself. So, when you get a chance try the weekly challenge for this week that comes accompanied with an excel spreadsheet containing historical data on equity risk premiums, interest rates and corporate bond default spreads.    Attachment: Implied premium challenge , data        2/20/15    If you have picked a company and collected the basic data (see last week's webcast), you probably more data in front of you then you want. In particular, those of you who have picked US companies have a 10K to read, in all of its bulk. Today's valuation tools webcast is about reading a 10K, with the intent of valuing a company. You can get the webcast by going to:    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/Reading10Knew.mp4    The webcast is accompanied by some supporting material, which you can get below:    Presentation: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/PG/Reading10KPG.pdf    P&amp;G 10K: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/PG/ProcterGamble10K.pdf    P&amp;G valuation: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/PG/P&amp;Gvaluationfixed.xls    This is a longer webcast than I would have preferred it to be.    Two final quick notes. First, if you are having troubles with this class, please do come in and see me. If you are too intimidated to do so (Why? Am I that scary?), you should draw on the TAs for the class and even try their review sessions next week.    Second, I don't mean to scare you but the first quiz is a week from next Wednesday (March 4). If you are interested in starting your preparation for the quiz, you can find every quiz 1 I have ever given in this class and there are a lot of them at the links below:    Past Quiz 1s: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz1.pdf   Past Quiz 2 solutions: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz1sol.xls        2/21/15    I hope that you are enjoying your &ldquo;cold&rdquo; weekend. I am attaching the newsletter for the week, in case you get really, really bored and have absolutely nothing else to do.    Attachment: Newsletter #3        2/22/15    I hope you had a chance to try the weekly challenge. If you did, you probably found it more an exercise in statistics than valuation and that is good. Statistics is a vastly under used tool in valuation. On a different note, we will complete our discussion of bottom up betas and discount rates this week. If you can find a beta page for your company (on Bloomberg or elsewhere) and the business breakdown for your company, you can see the contrast between the regression and bottom up betas for yourself.    Attachment: Weekly Challenge 2a solution        2/23/15    Today's class represented the final pieces of the discount rate puzzle. We began with a continued discussion of bottom up betas, focusing on defining comparable firms and expanding the sample. I did make a big deal about bottom up betas, but may have still not convinced you or left you hazy about some of the details. If so, I thought it might be simpler to just send you a document that I put together on the top ten questions that you may have or get asked about bottom up betas. I think it covers pretty much all of the mechanics of the estimation process, but I am sure that I have missed a few things.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/TenQs/TenQsBottomupBetas.htm   We continued with the cost of debt, starting with a definition of the cost of debt as a long term, current cost of borrowing and laying out a procedure for estimating this cost, even for firms that don't have traded bonds/ bond ratings. We also took a detour into estimating the cost of debt for firms that may receive subsidized debt from the government/ other entities. I am attaching the post class test and solution for today's class.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        2/24/15    This week&rsquo;s valuation is a fun one to do, since the company was started in New York and some of you may have eaten at it. The place to start your valuation is with my overview:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/Valuationofweek/ShakeShack.htm    Follow up with the prospectus:    http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1620533/000104746915000523/a2222881z424b3.htm    Get a sense of what the revenues and margins look like by restaurant:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/restaurants.xls    Then create a narrative for Shake Shack. Is is going to be the Chipotle of the next decade? Cheesecake Factory? Ruby Tuesday? My valuation is in this spreadsheet:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/ShakeShack2015.xls    I made it Ruby Tuesday-like in terms of revenues, gave it the margins of the 75th percentile restaurant and get a value per share of about $20, about the offering price but well below the current price. Have a go at it and once you have your values, visit the google shared spreadsheet:     https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rCy3PJeddXgMqNKrvh4ZElncpDp7-qzF6bOVafGlSK0/edit?usp=sharing    Have fun with it.        2/25/15    Today's class looked at the getting the base year's earnings right and explored several issues:    1. To get updated numbers, you should be using either trailing 12 month numbers or complete the current year with forecasted numbers. In either case, your objective should be to get the most updated numbers you can for each input rather than be consistent about timing.    2. To clean up earnings, you have to correct accounting two biggest problems: the treatment of operating leases as operating (instead of financial) expenses and the categorization of R&amp;D as operating (instead of capital) expenses. The biggest reason for making these corrections is to get a better sense of how much capital has been invested in the business and how much return this capital is generating.    3. While truly extraordinary items are easy to deal with, accounting ploys to move expenses into the extraordinary column may require some detective work. For those interested in forensic accounting, here are a couple of references:    http://www.amazon.com/Financial-Shenanigans-Accounting-Gimmicks-Reports/dp/0071703071/ref=pd_sim_b_8    http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Cash-Flow-Reporting-Sustainable/dp/0471469181/ref=pd_sim_b_2    Finally, this is an FT article on Amazon from last week that is illustrative of the games that companies play:    http://blogs.ft.com/lex-live/2015/02/19/amazon-in-its-own-words/    If you are really interested in nailing down the basics of cash flows (and preparing for the quiz next week), please try the post-class test (with solution) that is attached but really do try the weekly challenge for this week. It is a great exercise in tying up loose ends.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        2/26/15    With the quiz coming up next Wednesday (March 4), you have probably put the project on the back burner. But just in case you are working on it (and it is great preparation for your quiz), here is where you should be. You should obviously have a company picked and been able to estimate the different pieces that go into the cost of equity: a risk free rate in the currency of your choice, an equity risk premium reflecting where the company operates and a beta, reflecting the businesses it is in. For your debt, you should have a pre-tax cost of debt, based upon an actual or synthetic rating and converted this pre-tax cost of debt into an after-tax cost with a marginal tax rate. Finally, you should be able to use this pre-tax cost of debt, in conjunction with the book value of debt, interest expenses and the &quot;weighted&quot; maturity of the debt to convert the interest bearing debt into a market value.    If you find yourself struggling with the lease and R&amp;D adjustments that we talked about yesterday, do try the weekly challenge, which I have attached to this spreadsheet. Also, if you want to get a start on prepping for the quizzes, you can find every quiz that I have given in the valuation class for the 17 years in the links below, with the solutions.

Remember that you perfect a craft by doing.    Attachments: Weekly challenge #3        2/27/15    I know you are busy doing other stuff, but as the discussion shifts from discount rates to cash flows, the details start mounting and it is easy to get lost in abstractions. If you are interested in getting past abstractions, I have put together three webcasts for this week:    How to compute trailing 12 month earnings: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/Trailing12month.mp4 (Uses Apple from late 2012)    How to convert leases to debt: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/Leases.mp4 (Uses Disney in 2012)    How to capitalize R&amp;D: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/R&amp;D.mp4 (Uses Microsoft annual reports from 2012 &amp; 2011)    They are all about 10-15 minutes each... and you can download the spreadsheets and supporting material by going to     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm   I hope you get a chance (at least after the quiz) to watch one or more of these webcasts.        2/28/15    I hope that I have not ruined your weekend with the impending quiz, but if I have, so be it. I am attaching the newsletter for the week. I also posted a couple of items on my blog that you may find interesting. The first is a listing of what I term twisted DCFs, which have a D and a CF but don&rsquo;t really result in a DCF:     http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/02/dcf-myth-1-if-you-have-ddiscount-rate.html    The second is a post on why I think it is a mistake to keep talking about tech companies as if they shared common characteristics:    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-aging-of-tech-sector-pricing.html    Attachment: Newsletter #4        3/1/15    Next week brings the quiz, with all the angst and stress that quizzes usually bring. Note that the quiz will be in the first 30 minutes (1.30-2) of Wednesday's class and will cover everything through cashflows (about page 145 in the packet). We will not cover growth on this quiz. So ignore them on the past quizzes. What past quizzes, you ask? Here are the links:    Past quizzes: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz1.pdf    Past quiz solutions: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz1sol.xls    It is open book, open notes and open iPad but not open laptops. (Sorry!) If you are going to miss the quiz, you need to let me know before Wednesday at 1.30.    We will spend tomorrow finishing the discussion of cash flows and then start on growth rates, by first looking at the usefulness (or lack thereof) of historical (past) growth. We will then move to both analyst estimates and what I like to term intrinsic or fundamental estimates of growth, which we probably will turn to after the quiz on Wednesday. Yes, there is class after the quiz. Finally, the weekly challenge #3, which I have been nagging you to do, has a solution. I have attached it (with the rating spreadsheet that I needed to get the solution).    Attachment: Solution &amp; Synthetic  rating        3/2/15    Today's class covered a lot of topics, some related to cash flows and some related to growth. Let's start with the cash flow part first. I argued that capital expenditures should be defined broadly to include R&amp;D and acquisitions, for consistency reasons. If you want to count the good stuff (growth) that comes from these investments, you have to also count the cost. To get from cash flow to the firm to cash flow to equity requires us to bring in cash flows to and from debt. While borrowing more can make your cash flows to equity higher, they also make your equity riskier, raising the cost of equity. The net effect of leverage on the value of equity can be positive, negative or neutral, depending on the firm and where it is in its borrowing cycle. On growth, we started with historic growth and quickly dispensed with the notion that it is a fact. Depending on how it is estimated (arithmetic vs geometric) and over what period, you can get different numbers. It is also thrown off when a company's earnings go from negative to positive and generally becomes lower as companies get larger. While you can use analyst forecasts of growth, they have historically not done much better than time series forecasts, perhaps because analysts wear multiple hats.       One final point. As you work through the past quizzes, you will notice a lot of problems that deal with country risk and cost of equity. You will notice that in some of these questions, the answer uses the weighted equity risk premium approach, where you compute the equity risk premium for the risky country or countries, and multiply by the beta. In others, I use the more elaborate lambda approach, with lambda estimated by dividing the proportion of revenues in the country (for the company) by the proportion of the average company in the market.    Cost of equity = Risk free rate + Beta (Mature market premium + Country risk premium(s)); the equity risk premium can be a weighted average across multiple countries.    Cost of equity = Risk free rate + Beta * Mature market premium + Lambda(s) * Country risk premium(s)    Which one should you use? If you are given the data on what the average company makes in an emerging market, I am nudging you towards using a lambda approach. If that is not given, use the more conventional beta approach. Also, if you see an equity risk premium of 5.5% being used when none is given in the problem, that reflects a time period when I used to let people look up the ERP in their lecture notes and that was the historical ERP at the point in time that these quizzes were written.    As for the quiz, it is in the first 30 minutes of Wednesday's class. There will be class after the quiz. So, please hang around, if you finish early. IF YOU WILL NOT BE MAKING THE QUIZ, I NEED TO KNOW BEFORE 1.30 ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. If you are, it is open-book, open-notes but no laptops. You can use your iPads but no connectivity... I have attached the post-class test and solution.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/3/15    have views on: Apple. As you may know, I have been posting on Apple a long time on my blog and rather than point you to every post, I will point you to a long post from April of last year, where I referenced all my earlier posts and valuations of Apple:    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/04/watch-gap-apples-long-and-twisted.html    Once you have read this post, where I argued that Apple was approaching a full valuation in April, fast forward to the most updated numbers for Apple in this link:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/AppleFAMarch2015.pdf    Finally, here is my latest valuation of Apple:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/AppleMarch2015.xls    Play with it and make your own judgments on growth, margins, trapped cash and risk. Once you have a number, go in and add it to the shared Google spreadsheet:    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v3RCLLJwKrOperClX73cinO8uN4vpk6ocs9HSUR6JoM/edit?usp=sharing   You may want to do this after the quiz but it will give you some talking points when you are sitting at the beach on Caribbean resort trying to impress someone with your investment acumen.        3/4/15    The quizzes are done and you can pick them on the ninth floor of KMEC. As you come of the elevators, head towards the main doors and before you get to the doors, look to your right and you should see a table. You will see two (neat) piles in alphabetical order, face down. Please pick up only your quiz. I have attached the solution (with the grading template) and the distribution. If you have any issues with the grading of your quiz, please come an see me and don&rsquo;t go to the TAs. I will be in some of tomorrow and day after.    Attachments: First    quiz , the solution and the distribution of  grades.        3/4/15    I won't ask you how the first quiz went because that may evoke the wrong response. The good news is that it is over. If you were able to hang in there mentally and physically, we did complete our discussion of growth by looking at the fundamentals that drive growth. Starting with a very simple algebraic proof that growth in earnings has to come either from new investments or improved efficiency, we looked at how best to estimate growth in three measures of earnings: earnings per share, net income and operating income. With each measure of earnings, the estimation of growth boiled down to answering three questions: (1) How much is this company reinvesting to generating for future growth? (2) How well is it reinvesting? (3) How much growth is added or lost by changes in returns on existing investments? The weekly challenge for this week revolves around fundamental growth. Try it, if you get a chance. I have also attached the post class test and solution for today's class. Hope you get a chance!    Harking back to the quiz again, I am truly sorry for not sending you the review session. I know that it is too late for this quiz, but if you did badly, you may still find it useful (albeit frustrating).     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/valquiz1review.mp4    The supporting presentation for the quiz is at the link listed below:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pptfiles/val3E/valquiz1review.pptx    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/5/15    I hope that most of you have picked up your quizzes. I will leave them out until Monday but please do pick them up, if you have not already. You are probably in no mood for more valuation, but if you are, I would spend some time estimating the &quot;secret number&quot; in valuation: the return on invested capital and/or return on equity. Here are the steps:    1. Start by getting the current year's operating income and net income. Do all of the things we talked about last week including    - removing any one time charges or income    - update the numbers to make them current    - see if you can find out the interest income earned on cash and multiply by (1-tax rate). If you cannot find it, just multiply last year's cash balance by the treasury bill rate during the year.    Your preliminary estimate of income will be:    After-tax operating income = Operating income (1- Effective tax rate)    Net Income from non-cash assets = Net Income - Interest income from cash (1- tax rate)    2. Go to the balance sheet for the prior year (if you are doing trailing 12 months, go to the same quarter of the previous year)    - Get the shareholders' equity (this can be negative for some firms)    - Add up the interest bearing debt on the balance sheet (short term and long term debt)    - Get the cash balance    Your preliminary estimate of invested capital    Invested capital = Shareholders equity + Total Debt - Cash    Your preliminary estimate of book value of equity in non-cash assets will be    Book equity from non-cash assets = Book equity - Cash    3. Adjust for leases &amp; R&amp;D    - Adjust the operating income and net income for leases &amp; R&amp;D    - Adjust the book debt for the PV of operating leases    - Adjust the book equity for unamortized R&amp;D    Recompute your invested capital    4. Compute your ROE, non-cash ROE and ROIC    ROE = Net Income/ BV of equity    Non-cash ROE = Net Income from non-cash assets/ Book equity from non-cash assets    ROIC or ROC = After-tax operating income/ Invested Capital    You may get strange looking numbers. For instance, for some firms with large cash balances, your ROIC can be astronomical or negative. For young, growth firms, the ROIC and ROE can be negative. Don't freak out. You still have the power to override these numbers, when you make your forecasts for the future. In other words, what you really care about is ROE and ROIC on future new investments and you are not bound to use last year's numbers. If you are looking at industry averages for these numbers, they are on my website under updated data.    We also talked about items like goodwill and restructuring charges that can throw you off. If you are interested, here is the sleep-provoking paper of mine on ROE and ROIC that you will find absolutely engrossing (NOT!!!):    http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1105499        3/6/15    This week, we focused on estimating growth from fundamentals and built growth rates from accounting returns - return on equity and return on invested capital. Accounting returns can be messy and misleading. In this webcast (that some of you may remember from the corporate finance class), I look at the process of estimating accounting returns, using Walmart as my example:    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/ROIC.mp4    Walmart 10K (2013): http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/ROIC/walmart10K.pdf    Walmart 10K (2012): http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/ROIC/walmart10Klastyear.pdf    Spreadsheet: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/ROIC/walmartreturncalculator.xls    I hope you get a chance to take a look at it.    I have also attached this week&rsquo;s challenge, though you are probably burnt out after the quiz. If you do get a chance, give it a shot. It is also centered around estimating fundamental growth for a company.        3/7/15    Finally, it looks like we have a weekend that we can actually be outside and I hope you get a chance. Two very quick notes. First, the newsletter for the week is attached. Second, the second and third packets are ready to download online.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm   Look to the top of the page. The bookstore should also have a combined packet that includes packets 2 and 3 on their shelves right now, if you want to skip downloading and printing on your own.    Attachment: Newsletter #5        3/8/15    I hope that you had a chance to try the weekly challenge (I know.. I know.. No chance.. but no harm trying).... I have attached thes solution to this email. Just a heads up that this week, we will turn our attention to that big number in every DCF valuation, the terminal value, as well as how best to pick the right DCF model to value your company. If you want to get started on the DCF valuation for your company, it is a good week to get started or moving.    Attachment: Solution to weekly challenge #4        3/9/15    The heart of today's class was the discussion of terminal value. We began by ruling out using multiples to get terminal values, at least in the context of intrinsic value. To keep terminal values in check, you have to follow four basic rules/principles:    1. Constrain your terminal growth rate to be less than or equal to your riskfree rate (which is a proxy for long term growth in the economy)    2. Don't wait too long to put your company into stable growth (and try not to push past 10 years)    3. The key input in your terminal value computation is your return on capital (and excess return assumption). If your return on capital = cost of capital, your terminal growth rate does not add any value.    4. Give your company the characteristics of a stable growth company in terms of excess returns and cost of capital.    As for which model is right for you, use a firm valuation model if you believe that debt ratios will change over time or are not sure and reserve the dividend discount model for desperate times (when you lack the inputs to compute cash flows).   I have attached the post class test &amp; solution for today's class.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/10/15    Given that you just got your quiz back and probably want to get to work on your DCF valuation. So, I decided to go off on a tangent and reuse an offbeat assessment that I did on Bitcoin about a year ago. Like me, you have probably been watching Bitcoin go from $13 to $1000 and back down to $280 and wondered not only what was driving the price but what exactly it was. In my post a year ago, when Bitcoin was at $640, I pondered whether Bitcoin had a future and what its value was:    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/03/bitcoin-q-bubble-or-breakthrough-both.html    The numbers in the post may be dated but try to make your own judgments on four issues:    1. Do you think Bitcoin is a currency?    2. If no, what is it? (An equity instrument, a credit card, a scam)    3. Would you buy Bitcoin for a transaction? (I have a list of vendors who accept Bitcoin, in my post, and lay out the process for acquiring Bitcoin)    4. Would you trade in Bitcoin at today's price?    Finally, I looked at five currencies: the US $, the Chinese Yuan, the Argentine Peso, Gold and Bitcoin as competing currencies and given my priors, I ranked them as follows from best to worst as a currency that I would like to be paid in or in my pocket in any part of the world: US dollar, Gold, Chinese Yuan, Bitcoin, Argentine Peso. Please make your own rankings. Once you have them, go to this shared google spreadsheet and give me your views:    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Alt0SdORYnWadDdkQ3hobGdTdjNzSzgzQTdfUmNWRGc&amp;usp=sharing        3/11/15    Today's class was about the loose ends in valuation, items we often pay little heed to or attach arbitrary premiums/discounts for. We began by looking at cash and whether it should command a premium at some companies (if they have a good track record and have restrictions on raising capital) and a discount at others (if investors don't trust you with the cash). We then looked at cross holdings in other companies and the numerous barriers to valuing them. Third, we looked at other assets and argued that you should never double count assets. I have attached the post class test and solution.    On a different note, please do get a jump on the DCF valuation of your firm. The valuation is due on April 3 but only for feedback, not grading. So, don't feel the pressure to get it right. Just get it done. I have also attached the weekly challenge for this week, though this is little chance that you will be able to do it, on spring break. I will give a longer window than usual for submissions, and not send you the solution until March 23. Just one more email later today with the to do list for the valuation and I will then leave you to your own devices (I promise).    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/12/15    s you take for different parts of the world, I know that the last thing you want to think about is your DCF valuation. Anyway, I thought I would lend a helping hand:    1. Model building versus Model borrowing: This is not a modeling class and I am fine with you borrowing and adapting my models. If you decide to build your own model, keep it simple. Please do not use investment banking valuation models that you may have borrowed from a prior, current or summer job. Not only do they add detail, where you need none, but they often have fundamental mistakes built into them.    2. Which model should I use? First, go through the slides from a couple of sessions ago where we developed a roadmap for picking the right model. Once you have decided whether you want to use dividends, FCFE or FCFF, here is my suggestion. For companies where operating margins are not likely to change dramatically, use one of the ginzu models on my website. They are versatile and will do a lot a great deal of your dirty work (capitalizing R&amp;D, converting leases to debt, taking care of management options) for you. For companies where margins are likely to change over time or companies with negative earnings, use the higrowth.xls spreadsheet (even if you do not expect high growth). In particular, stick with the following choices:    a. fcffginzu.xls: if you are doing a FCFF valuation of a firm that has positive operating income and you do not expect dramatic shifts in margins (and return on capital) over time    b. fcffsimpleginzu.xls: if you are doing a FCFF valuation for a money losing firm or a high growth firm or want to allow your margins to change over time. (This is the most general model of the four.)    c. fcfeginzu.xls: if you are doing a FCFE valuation of a firm that has positive net income and you do not expect dramatic shifts in margins and leverage over time    d. divginzu.xls: for financial service firms    You can find all four of these under spreadsheets on my website.    Let me clarify, though, what I would like to get from you when you turn it in:    1. Each of you can turn in your valuation individually. You do not have to submit as a group.    2. All I want is a base case valuation of your firm. It will be easiest if you submit the excel spreadsheet containing your valuation and include your assumptions page in the same spreadsheet.    3. There is no hard copy required and you can submit your DCF valuation spreadsheet electronically. But please do the following:    In the subject enter: &quot;My perfect DCF Valuation&quot;. Do not deviate from the script or my filtering program will dump your email into my general email pile.    In the email text, specify the name of the company that you are valuing (yes, there are people who have submitted valuations of unnamed companies), the price per share that the stock is trading at on the day of your valuation and your estimate of value per share.    4. Your DCF valuation will not be graded. I will review the valuation and send you back your own spreadsheet with my comments embedded in the spreadsheet. Some of the comments will be suggestions (which you are free to ignore) and some will be stronger than suggestions (and these should probablyy not be ignored).    5. If you don't get back your valuation within 48 hours of submitting it, please send me another email to let me know. My filtering program sometimes works in mysterious ways.    6. If you get done before April 4, go ahead and send your valuation in early.    So, don't freak out about this deadline. It is more feedback on your valuation than judgment day...    Finally, if you are one of those people who likes checklists, I have attached one of those as well. Hope you find it useful.    Attachments: Dividend Discount Model , FCFE Discount Model , FCFF Discount Model , General FCFF Model , Valuation Checklist        3/21/15    I hope that your spring break was great but the bad news is that it is almost over. I don't mean to be the skunk at your party, but it is my duty to remind you that your DCF valuation is due for feedback by April 3. If you are working on it or plan to work on it, you will undoubtedly find that errors you make on your terminal value can drown out all of the good work that you do in estimating your inputs. I have a webcast that you may find useful in checking your terminal value (or someone else's estimate of terminal value). I hope you get a chance to check it out.    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/terminalvalue.mp4    Terminal value DCF (for use with the webcast): http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/webcasts/TermValueCheck/termvalueDCF.xls    Terminal value analyzer: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/webcasts/TermValueCheck/termvaluecheck.xls    Finally, if you want to see how this works in practice, take a look at the attached equity research report on Tesla from Morgan Stanley. Skip through the first 40 pages (they are impressive but a distraction) and go to page 41 to the DCF valuation. Put the terminal value to the test (using both the EBITDA multiple and the perpetual growth model used by the analyst). I am also attaching the newsletter for this week.    Attachments: Newsletter #6        3/22/15    Hope you are back and raring to go (Right... But no harm hoping...)! Anyway, ready or not, we are back to work tomorrow. After tying up a couple more loose ends (complexity, debt to net out of firm value to get to equity value and employee options/restricted stock), we will start on a series of valuations. We will begin easy, using a stable growth dividend discount model to value Con Ed, move up the difficulty ladder to value 3M with a FCFF model before and just after the 2008 market crisis and follow up with a valuation of the S&amp;P 500 at the start of 2015. We will then move into what I call the dark side of valuation, looking at difficult to value companies across the life cycle (from start up to decline), across sectors (financial service, cyclical, commodity) and across markets. If you are having trouble with your DCF valuation, odds are that we will address that issue in the context of valuing some other company in the next few sessions. I am also attaching the solution to the weekly challenge for this week. While you probably did not get a chance to work through the challenge, please do take a look at it since it relates to DCF's biggest number, the terminal value.        3/23/15    Today, we put the last two loose ends to rest. First, wwe went back and looked at defining debt. While we used a narrow definition of debt, when computing cost of capital, we argued for using a broader definition of debt, when subtracting from firm value to get to equity value. Next, we talked about how best to deal with both currently outstanding employee options and potential options grants in the future. With the former, we argued for using an option pricing model to value the options and netting that value out of equity value, before dividing by the number of shares outstanding. With the latter, we suggested incorporating the expected cost into the operating expenses, thus lowering future earnings and cash flows.    We then started on our first valuation, Con Ed, using a stable growth dividend discount model. To qualify to be valued with this model, we argued that a company had to meet three criteria: have a high payout ratio, have a fundamental growth rate less than that of the economy (or the risk free rate) and a beta close to one. We will continue with more valuations in Wednesday&rsquo;s session. If you are interested in downloading the excel spreadsheets with these valuations, you can get them here:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/covalsSpr2015.htm   I have also attached the post class tests/solutions for today.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/24/15    I am sorry to get this to you so late in the day but I was otherwise occupied. The company that I valued this week is CRH, an Irish company. If you have never heard of it, I don&rsquo;t blame you because I had not either. It is the third largest construction company in the world and you can start by reading the Bloomberg description of the company.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHBloomberg.pdf    You can then check the financial history of the company and its current bond rating, again using Bloomberg summaries:    Financial Summary: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHBloombergFA.pdf    Bond/Debt Rating: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHBloombergDebt.pdf    Finally, take a look at the annual report for 2014 for the company, which contains information on geography and product segments:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHAnnualReport.pdf    My valuation of CRH from earlier today (fresh of the press) is at the link below.    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHAnnualReport.pdf    You are probably wondering why I picked such a boring company to analyze and here is where it gets interesting. As part of a merger of Lafarge and Holcim, two European construction/engineering companies, those companies were required by the EU to shed assets and CRH was the acquirer.    Story on merger: http://www.wsj.com/articles/holcim-lafarge-confirm-asset-sale-talks-with-crh-1422859051    Story on asset purchase: http://www.wsj.com/articles/crh-confirms-6-5-billion-deal-to-buy-holcim-lafarge-assets-1422807500    We know that CRH paid 6.5 billion Euros for the assets and that the assets generate 6 billion Euros revenues in Asia, Latin America, UK and Canada. That is a big investment and if you are valuing CRH, you are probably at a loss on how to incorporate the effect of this asset acquisition into the value. Here is how I did it and you can take issue with it. I treated it like a capital budgeting project and estimated earnings and cash flows, based upon the average across construction companies globally for EBITDA margins and working capital. The present value of my cash flows came in at 6.27 billion Euros, about 230 million Euros less than what CRH paid for them.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHassetacquisition.xlsx    It is true that my estimates are based upon very limited information but it illustrates a simple process for dealing with add on actions. Since this may happen with the firms that you are valuing, please take a look at what I have done. It may be helpful. Finally, if you do try your hand at the valuation, you can input your numbers into the shared Google spreadsheet:    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KEiIkbOJxZlDYDfhRMduxeyQbpBLJS0VI31HAEQsDXI/edit?usp=sharing        3/25/15    In today's class, we started with two conventional valuations, one of 3M and the other of the S&amp;P 500. We then talked about the valuaton of young, growth companies by emphasizing that you will be wrong 100% of the time and that it was okay, because the market is usually even more wrong. Next session, we will continue with the discussion by looking at mature companies. Overall, we are approaching the end of the DCF section of this class. If you have not printed off packet 2 of the lecture notes, please do so or buy the packet at the bookstore (you will get packets 2 &amp; 3 consolidated). We will be getting to it next week. I have also attached the weekly challenge for this week (built around management options) and the post class test and solution.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/26/15    So, where are you in the DCF process? I hope that you have picked a company, collected the financials and actually tried to do a base case. A piece of advice. Get a base case valuation going with just minimal information (last annual report or 10K) and come back to it with more details. I have reattached the valuation checklist I sent you a couple of weeks ago, since you may find it more useful now. In case, you have forgotten which spreadsheets work best if you want to start with one of mine, you should stick with the ginzu versions:    a. fcffginzu.xls: For a firm with stable operating income and return on capital: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/fcffginzu2015.xls    b. fcffsimpleginzu.xls: For a money losing firm or a high growth firm or want to allow your margins to change over time (This is the most general model and you can use it for almost any non-financial service firm): http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/fcffsimpleginzu2015.xls    c. fcfeginzu.xls: For valuing a firm using the FCFE approach: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/fcfeginzu2015.xls    d. divginzu.xls: for financial service firms and perhaps REITs/MLPs: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/divginzu2015.xls    Finally, if yesterday&rsquo;s session provoked or rekindled your interest in Amazon, you may find this blog post I had in October 2014 interesting (because it not only compares my forecasts from 2000 to the actual numbers at the company but also provides an updated valuation):    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/10/if-you-build-it-revenues-they-profits.html    Attachments: Valuation Checklist        3/27/15    As you work on your perfect DCF valuations, employee options that your company has granted and continues to grant may be a source of imperfection. I know that we went through the mechanics in class. First, value the outstanding options, using an option pricing model. Second, subtract the value of the options from the equity value that you estimated in a DCF. Third, divide the remaining value by the number of shares outstanding (the actual number, not the diluted number). The mechanics of doing this can be tricky and that is why this week's weekly challenge is built around options. After you have tried the challenge, you may also want to watch this webcast that I put together on doing this in practice. I used Cisco, a monster option granter, to illustrate the mechanics. You can find the links below:    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/Employeeoptions.mp4    Cisco 10K: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/webcasts/EmployeeOptions/cisco10K.pdf    Spreadsheet for options: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/webcasts/EmployeeOptions/ciscooptions.xls   I hope you get a chance to watch the webcast and that you find it useful.        3/28/15    If you have finished your DCF and sent it to me, thank you! You should be hearing from me soon. If you are working on your DCF right now, I am sorry for distracting you. Please get back to work. If your question is &ldquo;what DCF&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you. No matter what you are doing, the newsletter is attached.    Attachment: Newsletter #  7 (March 28)        3/29/15    News on two fronts. The first is that the solution to the option weekly challenge is attached. If you are at all confused about valuing employee options, I would check it out. The second is an update on the week to come. We will start tomorrow by looking at other companies on the dark side of valuation, including distressed companies, cyclical companies and emerging market companies. On Wednesday, we will (hopefully) finish our discussion of packet 1. If you can, please download, print or buy packets 2/3. They are both ready to download online:    Packet 2: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/packet2spr15.pdf    Packet 3: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/packet3spr15.pdf    You can also get the powerpoint versions on the website for the class:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm    Look to the top of the page.   Also, not to be a nag, but please do work on your DCFs and get them to me by Friday.    Attachments: Weekly Challenge #5: Solution &amp; Option value        3/30/15    In today's session, we started with the depressing job of valuing declining and distressed companies, moved on to emerging market companies and ended with financial service companies. We are almost to the end of the DCF process now with only a couple of loose ends to tie up. Next session, we will look at the difference between value and price, what it tells us and what it does not. The post class test and solution are attached.    On a different note, please do work on your DCF valuations this week and try to get them to me by Friday. I could draw lines in the sand (by 5 pm Friday, or else) but I will not. So, do your best and I will do mine.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/31/15    In keeping with my exhortations to you to go where it is darkest, I decided to value Lukoil, a Russian oil company. You can start by reviewing the blog post that I had in November 2014 about Lukoil and Vale:    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/11/go-where-it-is-darkest-when-company.html    You can follow up with this updated summary of where Lukoil stands today (from Bloomberg):    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/LukoilBloombergMarch15.pdf    You can back up the Bloomberg numbers and get more details by downloading the Lukoil annual report for 2014 (it is in English):    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/LukoilAnnualReport.pdf    You can check out my valuation of Lukoil from March 2015:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/LukoilMarch2015.xls    Finally, you can tweak, modify or adjust the numbers to arrive at your own estimate of value for Lukoil and enter them in the shared Google spreadsheet:    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBOe327TnpycL-2dUorG2fX3x1t6zCsS2Gx9pldxV1c/edit?usp=sharing        4/1/15    In today's class, we finally put to rest DCF by having a discussion of the difference between value and price, why they might be different and when the gap will close. Before entering into that discussion by talking about the values of intangible asset companies and commodity/cyclical companies. With the latter, we noted the importance of keeping separate our macro views (about the economy or commodity) from our micro views, and the use of Monte Carlo simulations to deal with uncertainty. During that discussion, I talked about a paper that I have on statistical distributions and the link is below:     http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/papers/probabilistic.pdf    We ended the class by starting the discussion of multiples and comparable firms. We will continue that discussion after the second quiz. I have put the review session up online (on the webcast page for the class) with the presentation. The links are below:    Presentation: http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/valquiz2review.pdf    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/valquiz2review.mp4    You can also find all past quizzes with the solutions in the following links:    All past quiz 2s: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz2.pdf    Quiz 2 solutions: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz2sol.xls   You will see relative valuation problems (multiples) popping up in the pre-2008 quizzes. You can ignore them!    Attachments: Post class test and solution        4/2/15    I know that it seems like I am piling on, with your DCF due tomorrow and your quiz on Monday and I am sorry. However, I will not harass you too much today.    1. DCF: Please remember to put &quot;My Perfect DCF&quot; in the subject, when you send your DCF to me. All you have to send is your spreadsheet, with questions and comments embedded in it (if you have any)    2. Quiz: The quiz review, presentation and links to past quizzes were in yesterday's email (which I just resent). In case you did not get it or my retry, you can also get them by going to    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm        4/3/15    As I check my mailbox, I see that most of you have turned in your DCF valuations. I appreciate the effort and will get them back to you as soon as I can. I spent all day yesterday adn the day before grading corporate finance quizzes which came due on Wednesday and have not had a chance to look at the DCFs but I promise that I will get them back to you soon. There is no valuation tools webcast this week, as we take a break to get ready for the quiz. However, if you really miss the weekly challenges, I have attached the one for this week but it is on multiples (and hence not on your quiz). I will see you Monday at 1.30. Please don't be late and if you are going to miss the quiz, let me know ahead of 1.30    Attachments: Weekly challenge #6        4/4/15    Just in case you run out of things to do this weekend, the newsletter is attached. I am working my way through your valuations and will try to get them to you by Monday.    Attachment: Newsletter#  8 (April 4)        4/5/15    We have the quiz tomorrow in the first 30 minutes, followed by a continuation of the discussion of relative valuation. We will look at defining, describing and analyzing multiples. Please bring packet 2 to class tomorrow. Until next time! (I am also attaching the solution to weekly challenge #6 on the off chance that you tried it).    Attachment: Weekly Challenge #6 Solution        4/6/15    By now, all but a handful of you (I think I have about 8 DCFs left to do) should have received back your DCF valuation back. If you don&rsquo;t hear back by tomorrow, please send it again to me. Rather than make myself into an all-knowing oracle (which I am not), t thought I would take you through the process I used to diagnose your DCF valuations.    Input page checks    Step 1: Currency check: What currency is this company being valued in and is the riskfree rate consistent with that currency?    Right now, if you are valuing a company in US dollars, I would expect to see a riskfree rate of about 2% here.. though some of you used 30-year bonds rates which would give you a slightly higher value). if you are valuing your company in pesos or rubles, I would expect to see a higher riskfree rate, (Watch out for the tricky ones.. a Mexican company being valued in US dollars or a Russian company in Euros.. Your riskfree rates should revert back to 0.2%, if this is the case)    Step 2: ERP check: Is the equity risk premium being used consistent with where the market is right now and where this company has its operations?    If you are analyzing a company with operations only in developed markets, I would expect to see a number of about 5.5-6% here... That is because the current implied premium in the US is about 5.7% (April 2015). If you are using a premium of 4%, you will over value your company. If your company is exposed to emerging market risk, I would expect to see something added to the mature market premium. While I begin with the presumption that where your company is incorporated is a significant factor in this decision, it should not be the only one in this decision. Coca Cola and Nestle should have some emerging market risk built into them.    Step 3: Units check: Are the inputs in consistent units?    Scan the input page. All inputs should be in the same units - thousands, millions, billions whatever... What you are looking are units with far too many digits to make sense. (Check the number of shares. It is the input that is most often at variance with the rest, usually because you use a different source for it than the financial statements)    Step 4: Normalization check: If earnings are being normalized, what is the normalized value relative to the current value? If reinvestment numbers are off, should they have been normalized as well?    In some cases, we normalize earnings by looking at historical average earnings or industry average margins. While this is perfectly defensible, you want to make sure that the normalization is working properly. Thus, if earnings of $ 3 million are being replaced with earnings of $ 3 billion, you want to make sure that this company has generated earnings like these in the past. You may also want to consider an alternative which is to allow margins to change gradually over time rather than replace current with normalized earnings.    As a follow up, check the reinvestment rate for the firm. If it a weird number (900%, -100% etc.), it may be because something strange happened in the base year (a huge acquisition, a dramatic drop in working capital). A better choice may be to average over time.    Output page checks:    a. High Growth Period.    Start by checking the length of the growth period and the cash flows during the growth period. In particular,    - Compare the FCFF (or FCFE) to the EBIT (1-t) (or Net Income). Especially if you are forecasting cap ex, working capital and depreciation independently, compute an implied reinvestment rate    Implied Reinvestment Rate = 1 - FCFF/ (EBIT (1-t)   or 1 - FCFE/ Net Income    Thus, if you have after-tax operating income of 100 and FCFF of 95, your implied reinvestment rate is 5%.    - Look at the expected growth rate over the period. Does it jive with your reinvestment rate? (If you see a high growth rate with a low reinvestment rate, the only way you can justify it is by calling on efficiency growth. For that argument to make sense, your current return on capital has to be a low number... See the attached excel spreadsheet that computes efficiency growth.    - If you are forecasting operating income, cap ex, depreciation and working capital as individual line items, back out your imputed return on capital:    Imputed Return on Capital = Expected EBIT (1-t)/ (Base Year Capital Invested + Sum of all reinvestment through year t-1)    If you see this number taking off through the roof or dropping towards zero by the time you get to year 10, your reinvestment assumptions are unreasonable.    b. Terminal value    Start by checking to make sure your growth rate forever does not exceed your riskfree rate. Then follow up by    - Examining your reinvestment rate in your terminal year, using the same formula we used in high growth    - Backing out your implied return on capital (ROC = g/ Reinvestment Rate)    - Checking against your cost of capital in stable growth (you don't want to get more than 5% higher than the cost of capital and you do not want to set it lower than the cost of capital forever)    I have a spreadsheet that can help in this diagnostic (and there is a webcast that you can use as well from a few weeks ago)    One common error to watch out for is estimates of terminal value that use the cash flow in the final year, grow it out at the stable growth rate. That locks in your reinvestment rate from your last high growth year forever.    c. Cost of capital    As a general rule, your cost of capital should be consistent with your growth assumptions. Thus, you should expect to see betas move towards the stable range (0.8-1.2) and your debt ratios to rise towards industry average. Thus, your cost of capital in stable growth should be different from the cost of capital in high growth.    d. Final value of equity    Check for danger signs, including    - Cash and cross holdings becoming a huge percentage of value    - Options either being ignored or being a huge number    Market Price    As a final sanity check, look at the current market price. If your value is not even in the ballpark, go back and repeat all of the earlier steps...    Try it out with your own DCF valuation and then offer to do it for a friend... Then, take your toolkit on the road. Pick up a valuation done by an investment bank or equity research analyst and see if you can diagnose any problems in them. You are well on your way to being a valuation guru. I have also attached a full set of diagnostic questions that you can consider in the context of valuation to this email. Until next time!    Attachments: Growth Check , Terminal Value Check , Post Mortem        4/6/15    Your quizzes and are ready to be picked. Please take just your quiz, leave the pile in alphabetical order and don&rsquo;t browse. I have attached the solution and the grading distribution. As always, if there is a screw up, it is my fault. Please bring your quizzes in and I will fix my mistake.    Attachments: Solution as    well as the distribution of  grades        4/7/15    I meant to send this yesterday but events got ahead of me. This week, I turn to pricing and to how the price you attach to a company (or any asset) will depend on the comparables that you use. I use Amgen and the healthcare sector to illustrate my point. I have attached spreadsheets containing (1) all health care firms, (2) only firms that are categorized as pharmaceuticals by Cap IQ and (3) only firms that are categorized as biotech by Cap IQ. The spreadsheets include about ten multiples computed for each firm, ranging from standard PE to EV/Sales. In a very simple exercise, I then pick PE to illustrate its weakness in this sector and also its distributional properties and price Amgen, relative to both pharma and biotech companies. It is the most sophisticated exercise in the world, but it indicates how different your conclusions can be. If you really want to explore multiples, try EV/Sales and see what you get as a comparison.    Attachments: The Healthcare Sector (US): Raw company data , The Pharmaceuticals: PE Ratio Distribution and Statistics , The Biotechnology firms: PE Ratio Distribution and Statistics , Pricing Amgen as a pharma company and then as a biotech company        4/8/15    In today's class, we extended our analysis of multiples by first looking at PE and PEG ratios, then moving on to PBV ratios and finally examining enterprise value multiples: EV/Invested Capital, EV/EBITDA and EV/Sales. In particular, we noted that the drivers for EV multiples are analogs of the equity multiples: growth in operating income replacing growth in net income, reinvestment rates replacing payout ratios, ROC replacing ROE and cost of capital replacing cost of equity. There is a simple way to find the companion variable (the key driver) for a multiple. With an equity multiple, you can get this variable by dividing the net income by the denominator of the multiple. With an enterprise value, you divide after-tax operating income by the denominator of the multiple. With the EV/Sales ratio, this yields the after-tax operating margin as the determining variable. We used that measure to evaluate the value of a brand name, by comparing the pricing of Coca Cola with its current operating margin with its value with a generic margin. Finally, I am attaching the post class test/solution for today as well as the weekly challenge for this week. Until next time!    Attachments: Post class test and solution        4/9/15    As promised (or threatened), the mystery project is ready for you. It is a group project, due two weeks from today (Wednesday, April 24, at 5 pm). The assignment is a pretty straightforward one, and the write up should be brief and to the point. Be creative, use statistics as a tool and don't be afraid to be different.... I have attached the project description and the data that you will need (it is also online on the webcast page for the class and under the main menu for the class... will also be posted on iTunes U).    Attachments: The mystery project , Data for mystery project        4/10/15    One of the most confusing aspects of multiples is dealing with the variants of value out there: firm value, enterprise value and equity value. In this webcast, I look at what the differences are between these different numbers and how our assessments of leases &amp; R&amp;D can change these numbers.

For those of you who are new to this experience, you will soon find out... I am sure that you are finding that break is passing by way too fast, but the semester is almost upon us and I want to welcome you to the Valuation class. One of the best things about teaching this class is that valuation is always timely (and always fun...) Just as examples: Is it time to buy or sell Twitter? Is Uber worth $40 billion? Is there a market bubble? What is the value added by the Kardashian sisters? Are the Dallas Cowboys really worth more than the New York Yankees? If you have not visited my blog, I put my thoughts down on these issues (though I am still working on the Kardashian valuation):    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/    1. Preclass work: I know that some of you are worried about the class but relax! If you can add, subtract, divide and multiply, you are pretty much home free... If you want to get a jump on the class, you can go to the class web page:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/equity.html    2. Syllabus &amp; Calendar: The syllabus for the class is available on the website for the class and there is a google calendar for the class that you can get to by clicking on     http://bit.ly/1xfQ1ov    For those of you already setting up your calendars, it lists when the quizzes will be held and when projects come due.    3. Lecture notes: The first set of lecture notes for the class should be available in the bookstore by the start of next week. If you want to save some money, they can also be printed off online (if you want to save some paper, you can print two slides per page and double sided). To get to the lecture notes, you can try     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/eqlect.htm    Please download and print only the first packet on discounted cashflow valuation. If you want to save paper, you can download the pdf file on you iPad, Android or Kindle and follow along...    4. Delivery choices: I hope to see you all in class for every session, but there are three supporting delivery mechanisms that I would like you to take advantage of:    a. Yellowdig: I don&rsquo;t much care for NYU classes and use it sparingly. I am trying out a new service called Yellowdig that combines social media, content and commentary.     https://www.yellowdig.com    You should be getting an invite to join the class. Please accept the invite.    b. iTunes U: I will also be posting the material for the class on iTunes U. If you have never used iTunes U, you need an Apple device (iPad or iPhone) and have to download the iTunes U app (free). Once you have the app, use the link below:     https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/valuation-spring-2015/id959944561    I really like the set up and I think you may enjoy it too.    c. YouTube Channel: There is a final option, if your broadband connection is not that great and you are watching on a Tablet/smartphone. There is a YouTube playlist for this class, where all class sessions will be loaded.     http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkh9m2BorqlC9L22LncmXWf_GPbBtScc    When you get a chance, check it out.    5. Books for the class: The best book for the class is the Investment Valuation book - the third edition. (If you already have the second edition, don't waste your money. It should work...) You can get it at Amazon or wait and get it at the book store... If you are the law-abiding type, you can buy &quot;Damodaran on Valuation&quot; - make sure that you are getting the second edition. If you can get the Asian edition, even better. It is exactly the same book and costs about a third. Or, as a third choice, you can try The Dark Side of Valuation, again the second edition, if you are interested in hard to value companies.. Or if you are budget and time constrained, try &quot;The Little Book of Valuation&quot;. http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/public.htm    6. Valuation apps: One final note. I worked with Anant Sundaram (at Dartmouth) isn developing a valuation app for the iPad or iPhone that you can download on the iTunes store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uvalue/id440046276?mt=8   It comes with a money back guarantee... Sorry, no Android version yet... As for Blackberry, fuggedaboutit... Dead technology walking!!! I am looking forward to seeing you in a few days (The first day of class is February 2, 2015. I think we are going to have a lot of fun (at least, I am... ).        1/28/15    Just a few quick notes leading into next week's class.    1. Please make sure that you got my email from last week. If you joined the class this week or just don't read class related emails during your break, you can find the entire email by going to     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/eqemail.html    2. Please do accept the invite to the class on Yellowdig that I sent you last week. ( https://www.yellowdig.com/board/Valuation+Spring+2015 )    3. Visit the website for the class and check out the Google calendar to make sure that you don't have any quiz conflicts:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/equity.html    Finally, we don't have to wait until next week to start talking about valuation, right? So, what do you think about the chaos in the currency market and how it is affecting stocks? What about oil prices? Lots to think about before class on Monday. Look forward to seeing you in KMEC 2-60 from 1.30-2.50 on February 2. Until next time!        2/1/15    As we get ready for class tomorrow, I think you my find this post that I put on my blog today useful in giving you a sense of what this class is about and what it is not about.    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/02/discounted-cashflow-valuations-dcf.html   I am going to post it on Yellowdig and you can add your own views (which can be different from mine). If you have not accepted your invite to Yellowdig and cannot find it, I will send out another invite tonight. I will see you tomorrow in KMEC 2-60 at 1.30 pm. Game on! (Superbowl, I mean!)        2/2/15    First, a quick note about today's class. During the session, I told you that that this was a class about valuation in all of its many forms &ndash; different approaches (intrinsic, relative &amp; contingent claim), different forums (for acquisitions, value enhancement, investing) and across different types of businesses (private &amp; public, small and large, developed &amp; emerging market). After spending some time laying out the script for the class (quizzes, exams, weekly tortures), I started on the intro to valuation by giving you my reasons for doing valuation (to fight looming lemingitis) and starting on the discussion of widely held misconceptions about valuations.    With that out of the way, have you classified yourself yet? Are you a proud lemming, a &quot;Yogi bear&quot; lemming or a lemming with a life-vest? While you are pondering that life-changing question, I do have some points to make:   &bull; Please do find a group to nurture your valuation creativity, and a company to value soon. If you are ostracized, please let me know...   &bull; Once you pick a company, collect information on the company. I would start off on the company's own website and download the annual report for the most recent year (probably 2012) and then visit the SEC website (http://www.sec.gov) (for US listings) and download 10Q filings. (You can pick any publicly traded company anywhere in the world to value. The non-US company that you value can have ADRs (but does not have to have ADRs) listed in the US but you still have to value it in the local currency and local market. You can even analyze a private company, if you can take responsibility for collecting the information.)   &bull; The web cast for the first class are up and running (or at least the streaming version). You can access it by going to:     http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/9f47a09c1e0c4608a1382558f8b02caa1d    The links to iTunes U and Yellowdig have not been posted yet, since I don't have the downloadable video file link yet.   &bull; Post class test: To review what we did in class today, I prepared a very simple post-class test. I have attached it, with the solution. Give it your best shot.    If you did not get the syllabus, project description and the valuation intro in class this morning, they are all available to print off from this site.    Sorry about the length of this email, but there will be more to come (I promise!).    Attachments: Post-class test and solution .        2/3/15    I hope that the sun outside is cheering you up and I hope that this email is not a downer. Two very quick notes before I leave you to your own devices. First, the first valuation of the week is up and I hope that you get a chance to do it. Uber, as you undoubtedly know, is the superstar of the car-sharing/tech space, attracting venture capital money at an almost unstoppable clip, It's value estimate has surged from a billion to $17 billion to $41 billion in the span of a year, which raises a valuation question. Is it worth that much? In this weekly challenge, I argue that the value that you attach to Uber is very much a function of what you think its business is (a car service company, a logistics company or a transportation company?), what type of networking advantages it will have in this business and its competitive advantages. You can start the challenge with this blog post that I had last month:     http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/12/up-up-and-away-crowd-valuation-of-uber.html    Follow it up by taking a look at the spreadsheet that I created for the company, where you can choose your narrative points and come up with a value.    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/uberDec14.xls    Feel free to make your choices and come up with your own estimate of value. Once you have it, please go to this Google shared spreadsheet and share your estimate.    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xlLMLSxNZOFjnol110WkrWSmEm378swfz5C4hu6J778/edit#gid=0    Let's get this going!    Second, the webcasts links are all up and running. Even if you were in class yesterday, pick your preferred link and try it out. You never know when you may need it:    Webcast page for the class for Stream, downloadable video and downloadable audio: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm    iTunes U: https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/id959944561    Yellowdig: https://www.yellowdig.com/board/Valuation+Spring+2015    YouTube: http://youtu.be/l4Vb6mJqURs    Second, please work on becoming part of a group and picking a company. They don&rsquo;t have to be sequential. It is true that some of you (law students, EMBAs, Langone MBAs) may have trouble finding a group. I have created a Google shared spreadsheet of Valuation Orphans where you can meet.    https://docs.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1aRV7UVM1Nh-x4rurEA-92mN73BFhoypD9lnhHKnoNkY/edit?usp=sharing        2/4/15    As I mentioned in Monday&rsquo;s class, we will start each class with a simple test, previewing what we will be covering during the class. While this may seem ass-backwards, it is meant to illustrate a simple fact. Most of the time, you will be able to reason your way to the right answer, even before we unveil it in class, and when you do not, it is useful to examine why. While I will usually not send you the start of the class ahead of time, I decided to do so today because I would like you to spend some time (say 5-10 minutes) thinking about it. So, please give the attached test a scan before class today. See you in class!    Attachments: biastests.pdf        2/4/15    Today's class started with a test on whether you can detect the direction bias will take, based on who or why a valuation is done. The solutions are posted online. We then moved on to talk about the three basic approaches to valuation: discounted cash flow valuation, where you estimate the intrinsic value of an asset, relative valuation, where you value an asset based on the pricing of similar assets and option pricing valuation, where you apply option pricing to value businesses. With each approach, we talked about the types of assets that are best priced with that approach and what you need to bring as an analyst/investor to the table. For instance, in our discussion of DCF valuation and how to make it work for you, I suggested that there were two requirements: a long time horizon and the capacity to act as the catalyst for market correction. Since I mentioned Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman as hostile acquirers (catalysts), you may want to look at Herbalife, the company that Ackman has targeted as being over valued and Icahn did for being under valued. See if you can get a list going of how he is trying to be the catalyst for the correction... and think about the dark side of this process.       Speaking about input fatigure, I am attaching the link to a New York Times piece on decision fatigue. It is a fun and interesting read. Please take a look at it, when you get a chance:    http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?pagewanted=all   We ended the class today with the question of whether equity valued directly (by discounting cash flows to equity at the cost of equity) will yield the same value as equity valued indirectly (by valuing the firm and subtracting out debt). i know that we really have not delved into valuation in depth, but if you are up to it, try the first weekly challenge (which is attached). When you are done, go into NYU Classes (it is the only time I will use NYU classes) and submit your answer. I will give you mine on Sunday. I am also attaching the post class test and solution for the session.    Attachments: Post-class test and solution .        2/5/15    It is never too early to start nagging you about the project. So, let me get started with a checklist (which is short for this week but will get longer each week. Here is the list of things that would be nice to get behind you:    Find a group: If you have trouble finding one, try the orphan spreadsheet for the class. ( https://docs.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1aRV7UVM1Nh-x4rurEA-92mN73BFhoypD9lnhHKnoNkY/edit?usp=sharing )    Pick a company: This will require some coordination across the group to make sure that you meet the minimum criteria (at least one money loser, high growth, emerging market, service company)    Find the most recent annual report for your company.    If your company has quarterly reports or filings pull them up as well.    In doing all of this, you will need data and Stern subscribes to one of the two industry standards: S&amp;P Capital IQ (the other is Factset). It is truly a remarkable dataset with hundreds of items on tens of thousands of public companies listed globally, including corporate governance measures. However, to use Capital IQ, you have to enroll and this is an email I got earlier this week about enrolling. Please, please register now. You will not regret it and it will not only save you lots of time in the future but will give you another weapon you can use in analysis.    Professor Damodaran,    My office has sent the below message to your department for distribution, but I wanted to make sure that you have this information, since I know you have incorporated Capital IQ into your coursework in the past.    The enrollment period for spring semester Capital IQ accounts is currently underway. If you are planning to have your MBA students use Capital IQ this semester, please let your students know they have from now until February 25th to request spring semester accounts by filling out the Capital IQ form on their Career Account. Please note that even if students will need Capital IQ for projects later on in the semester, they will need to request access during this official enrollment period at the beginning of the semester.    For non-MBA Stern students, there are 10 Capital IQ-enabled terminals on campus that do not require a Capital IQ account. The undergraduate terminals are located in the computer bank near Stair Y on the LC level, and the graduate terminals are located on the 5th floor of KMC outside Suite 5-100. Capital IQ is accessed by clicking the Capital IQ bookmark in Firefox or a different browser.       Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about Capital IQ access,        2/6/15    I know that many of you still pondering your company choices and group dynamics, but if and when you pick a company, the first step is to get the raw material you need for your valuation. These include data on the company (annual reports, regulatory filings like the 10K/10Q), sector wide data (numbers for other companies in your sector) and macro economic data. I know that many of you already know exactly how to do this. However, if you feel uncertain, you can try this webcast out.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/gettingdata.mp4    Incidentally, I do talk about using Capital IQ to get sector wide information in this webcast.    On a different note, a couple of reminders of notes that I have already sent out. First, the valuation of the week (Uber) and the shared google spreadsheet await you. You can find the full details on the webcast page for the class:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm   Give it a shot, when you get a chance. Second, the weekly challenge was posted (and emailed to you) a couple of days ago. I will post my solution on Sunday, but please try it out before then. To submit your answer on NYU classes, here is what you will need to do. Log into NYU classes and click on assignments. You will see the first weekly challenge up there. Come up with your answer and submit it here. You are off to the races.        2/7/15    Just a quick hit and run. Your first newsletter is attached. No real news to report, especially if you were in class, but no harm checking it out. Have a great weekend!    Attachments: Newsletter #1        2/8/15    First things first. This week, we will be delving into the mechanics of discount rates, starting with the risk free rate and then moving on to the equity risk premium. They are both central to valuation and we live in unusual times, where the former, in particular, is doing strange things. Additionally. I hope that you had a chance to try the first weekly challenge. If you did, you can check your solution against mine. Even if you did not, you can try the challenge now (or in the near future) and check out the solution.    Finally, we will be starting off tomorrow's class with the question of firm versus equity valuation. I am attaching the cash flow table that we will be using for the start-of-the-class test as well. If you get a chance, please take a look at it before you come into class.    Attachments: Weekly Challenge Solution , Start of the class test        2/9/15    Today's class started with a look at a major investment banking valuation of a target company in an acquisition and why having a big name on a valuation does not always mean that a valuation follows first principles. After setting the table for the key inputs that drive value - cash flows, growth, risk, we looked at the process for estimating the cost of equity in a valuation. The key concept is that of a &quot;marginal&quot; investor, who is diversified and looking at risk through that investor's eyes. We spent the rest of the session talking about what should be (but no longer is) the simplest input into the process: the risk free rate.    I hope that the discussion of riskfree rates a left you fairly clear about what to do next. In case, you are still confused, this is the next step in the process:    1. Pick a company (in case you have not already).    2. Determine a currency that you will value the company in. Once you have decided on the currency, find a riskfree rate in that currency. If your company is a US or European company, you just got lucky. Either take the easy way out and use the US T.Bond rate as the dollar riskfree rate and the German 10-year bond rate as the Euro riskfree rate, or adjust them for the default risk you see in each sovereign.    If you are valuing a company in an emerging market in the local currency (be brave), your job is a little more complicated.    2a. Get the longest term government bond rate you can get in the local currency. You can check out the Economist (look at the tables towards the end of the publication and at the long term interest rate). You can also try this site for long term local currency government bond rates:    http://www.tradingeconomics.com/bonds    2b. Get the local currency rating for the country by going to the moody's web site: http://www.moodys.com (Look under sovereign ratings). Estimate the default spread given the rating by downloading the country default spread spreadsheet that you can find at the link below    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/ctryprem.xls    2c. If you prefer to get CDS spreads, use the current CDS spreads that I have as an attachment (I will post both under the webcast page fand on the coursekit page as well)    2d. Riskless Rate = Government bond rate - Default Spread given rating    I have a paper on riskfree rates that elaborates on the discussion in class today. It is really not a painful read, if you can spare the time. You can get to it by going to:     http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1317436    I also have a follow-up paper on the &quot;What if&quot; series.. what if nothing is riskfree     http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1648164    Finally, I did a post on my blog specifically on the question of the risk free rate being low and the implications for valuaton:     http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2011/09/risk-free-rates-and-value-dealing-with.html    The topic seems to have acquired some followers among appraisers/analysts. This article provides a reasonable synopsis of where they stand:     http://www.hl.com/email/pdf/FW_Sep2011.pdf   The post class test and solution are also attached.    Attachments: Post-class test and solution .        2/10/15    This week&rsquo;s valuation is of a very different company from last week&rsquo;s, from the pinnacles of hope (Uber) to the valley of despair (Petrobras). It is a fascinating case study in how to destroy a company quickly, a perverse exercise in doing everything that you can do wrong in corporate finance. Start with the blog post:     http://bit.ly/1z5Po1D    Once you have read it, try the excel spreadsheet that contains the valuation:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/PBR2015.xls    When you have tried your hand at it, then go to the shared Google spreadsheet and give me your views;    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vBtn9QkFZCvKHi7tzbJnoirmwYOzGZG2VSD5kIMXFk/edit?usp=sharing   Hope you get a chance to try it.    Attachment: Petrobras Valuation        2/11/15    We are little more than halfway through the discussion of equity risk premiums but the contours of the discussion should be clear.    a. Historical equity risk premiums are not only backward looking but are noisy (have high standard errors). You can the historical return data for the US on my website by going to    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/data.html    Click on current data, and look to the top of the table of downloadable data items.    b. Country risk premium: The last few months should be a reminder of why country risk is not diversifiable. As you see markets are volatile around the world, I think you have a rationale for a country risk premium. You can get default spreads for country bonds on my site under updated data. If you are interested in assessing and measuring country risk, to get from default spreads to equity risk premiums, you need two more numbers. The first is the standard deviation for the equity market in the country that you are trying to estimate the premium for. Try the Bloomberg terminal. Find the equity index for the country in question (Bovespa for Brazil, Merval for Argentina etc.) and type in HVT. This should give you the annualized standard deviation in the index - change the default to weekly and use the 100-week standard deviation. Do the same for the country bond in question. The two standard deviations should yield the relative volatility. If you have trouble finding either number, just multiply the default spread by 1.5 to get a rough measure of the country risk premium.    As for other sites that look at country risk, here is one that you may want to look at. It is the site maintained by Professor Campbell Harvey at Duke who does very good work on country risk:     http://www.duke.edu/~charvey/Country_risk/couindex.htm    If you want my estimates of country risk premiums, check under updated data on my website. The direct link is below:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/ctryprem.xls    On the same theme, the weekly challenge for this week will let you work your way through the country risk premium numbers on your own.    c. Company risk exposure to country risk: My concept of lambdas for countries is a work in progress. I have a paper on the topic that you can read, if you are so inclined:     http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=889388    d. Implied equity risk premiums: I know that we barely touched this concept in class today, but its is not rocket science and I am sure that you can work with it. I am attaching the excel spreadsheet that will allow you to compute implied equity risk premiums. I am using the numbers that I used at the start of February to come up with an equity risk premium of 6.01%.    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/implprem/ERPFeb15.xls    Please try to update the implied premium, using today's numbers for the S&amp;P 500 (easy) and the 10-year T.Bond rate (easy). Leave everything else untouched including growth rate in earnings for next five years &amp; updated dividends and buybacks from the spreadsheet (since these were updated a month ago). Follow the instructions to get the updated equity risk premium. We will explore it further in class a week from today (since there is no class on Monday).    The post class test and solution are attached.    Attachments: Post-class test and solution .        2/12/15    I hope the week was a good (and productive one). Next week is a short week, since we have no class on Monday. Just to prod you (and harass you), I want to check on where you are on the project. Assuming that you have picked a company, joined a group and downloaded the financials, I had suggested after Monday's class that you estimate a riskfree rate in the currency that you will be doing the valuation in. If you have doubts about how to do this, the weekly challenge for this week will be a good way to test your understanding. It is online in the usual spots (webcast page and iTunes U) and is attached to this email. As with the first weekly challenge, you should be able to submit it on NYU classes. By the way, if you do have a chance, give the Petrobras valuation (on webcast page) a few minutes of your time as well....    Once you have a risk free rate, here are your next few steps:    Get a geographical breakdown of the countries/regions of the world that your company operates in. It should be in your annual report or financial disclosure forms somewhere. If you cannot, them's the breaks...    Get the total equity risk premium and country risk premium for the countries/regions: If you want to do this yourself, the weekly challenge will give you a template. If you want to take a short cut and use my estimates of country risk premiums, that is fine too.    Get a weighted average of the country risk premiums: You can use revenue weights of the country/region to compute the weighted average.    Finally, I hope you have had a chance of updating the implied equity risk premium spreadsheet that I sent you with Wednesday's email. All you have to do is update the S&amp;P 500 and the US treasury bond rate and use the goal seek (instructions on spreadsheet).    Attachments: Weekly Challenge #2        2/13/15    As you get ready for the long weekend, a couple of quick notes:    1. Implied ERP: In case you have a chance to try out the implied ERP spreadsheet (attached again to this email), I put together a short webcast (20 minutes) on both the mechanics of the implied ERP (using the February 2014 version of the spreadsheet) and how I get the numbers for the spreadsheet. I hope you get a chance to look at the webcast (and any feedback on making these webcasts more useful will be appreciated):    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/ImpliedERP.mp4    Presentation: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/ERP/ImpliedERP.ppt    Spreadsheet: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/implprem/ERPFeb14.xls    I have also put the links up on my webcast page(and Yellowdig &amp; iTunes U) for the data on buybacks and earnings growth.    2. Musk&rsquo;s narrative: In spite of my bearish views on Tesla, I have always liked Elon Musk for his charisma and vision. In fact, he has often been much more reasonable about Tesla&rsquo;s growth prospects that some of his more rabid fans (who also happen to be Tesla stockholders). Thus, I was surprised to read this:     http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2015/02/12/tesla-motors-could-reach-apples-market-cap-levels-ceo-musk-says/?mod=WSJ_LatestHeadlines    I especially focused on his rationale for why Tesla could be worth as much as Apple in 10 years. Quoting Musk, &ldquo;If you take this year&rsquo;s revenue, around $6 billion or thereabout, and if we&rsquo;re able to maintain a 50% growth rate for 10 years and achieve 10% profitability number and have a 20 (price-to-earnings ratio), our market cap would be basically the same as Apple&rsquo;s is today&rdquo;. Remember we talked about narratives and how they can spill out of control, if you are not disciplined. This is about as absurd a set of presumptions that I have seen strung together in one sentence. Food for thought!    3. Review Sessions: If you are having trouble keeping up with the class or working through the concepts, the TAs will be running review sessions every week on Wednesdays from 4.30-5.30 in 2-90. To attend these sessions, please sign up in the shared Google spreadsheet that has been set up for the purpose.   https://docs.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1kjszWGZqmwwl_2-bx3MWM0B6tjT6JZx4oGbcDfg5Kjg/edit#gid=0        2/14/15    Last week, we put the basics of valuation behind us and started on the nuts and bolts. In particular, we spent Monday talking about how to estimate risk free rates in different currencies and why they may be different. On Wednesday, we looked at equity risk premiums, talked about why historical risk premiums may be flawed and how to estimate equity risk premiums in other markets. Next week, we will have only one session and will examine a different way of thinking about equity risk premiums and also talk about alternatives to measuring the relative risk in a stock. I know that this is a long weekend and I hope you have fun. However, please do find a group, pick a company, estimate a risk free rate in the currency of your choice and start thinking about the ERP for your company. ( What a fun sucker? I know.. I know.. That is what my kids call me too&hellip;)    Attachments: Newsletter #2        2/15/15    I will keep this short. The solution to the second weekly challenge is attached, with the challenge. If you did not get a chance to do it, you can still try it. Next week is going to be a short one, since we have no class tomorrow. On Tuesday, I will still put up my valuation of the week and on Wednesday, we will look at how to estimate implied equity risk premiums and estimating the relative risk of a company. If you have picked a company, try to find a beta for your company from a service and bring it to class with you. Other than that, not much more to do. Have a wonderful rest of the weekend.    Attachments: Weekly Challenge #2 Solution        2/17/15    I hope that you had a productive weekend (or at least a fun one). Well, it is time to get back to work and to celebrate. I usually don&rsquo;t repeat valuations of the week, but I decided to make an exception this week, since this merger is one that we have all heard about (and have opinions about). A year ago, almost to the day, I posted my assessment of the Comcast/TWC deal. You can begin by reading the news story of the deal as it happened in February 2014:     http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-12/comcast-said-to-agree-to-pay-159-a-share-for-time-warner-cable.html    I posted this on my blog on February 18, 2014:    http://bit.ly/1ht9ejW    You get the summary data, as of February 2014, for the two companies at the link below:    Comcast Summary data: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/ComcastSummary.pdf    TWC Summary data: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/TWCSummary.pdf    The spreadsheet containing my valuation of synergy is at the link below:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/TWCComcast.xls    It is a year later and the merger that looked like a sure thing a year ago is faltering:     http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/02/02/investors-concern-mounting-over-time-warner-cable-comcast-deal/    I know that the numbers have changed for the two companies, as have the risk free rate and equity risk premium. I updated all of the numbers in this spreadsheet:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/TWCComcast2015.xls    If you get a chance, give the synergy spreadsheet a shot and when you are done, go into this shared Google spreadsheet and give me your assessments on what you think of this merger (that now may not go through):    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ujtm0jqYS9LggLliovwBH7W-gfSFbYuxdy64oCVWukg/edit?usp=sharing        2/18/15    By now, you are probably tired of equity risk premiums and I don't blame you. Today's session, though, was all about implied equity risk premiums and what causes them to change over time. Other things remaining equal, higher stock prices, higher cash flows and higher expected growth all push up the ERP, whereas a higher riskfree rate pushed the ERP down. If you get a chance, please play with the equity risk premium spreadsheet to check for yourself.    As for the inputs into the model, there is not much suspense. Here is where you can get them:    a. Level of the index: Almost everywhere    b. Cash flows on the index: For the S&amp;P 500, I go to the source:    http://www.standardandpoors.com    Click on the S&amp;P 500 and then on index announcements. The most recent release on the buybacks/dividends on the index should be there somewhere. The only problem is that S&amp;P updates these numbers on December 15, March 15, June 15 and September 15. So, you will have to leave the numbers unchanged during those months where there are no updates.    You have a choice on which cash flows to use in computing your premium: Current (trailing 12 month), average over last 5 years, average over last 10 years.    c. Expected growth rate: The easy route is to do what we did in class and get the data from Yahoo! Finance, where you will find it in any company's Yahoo page (under analyst estimates at the bottom of the page ). The better way to get it is to find a Bloomberg terminal, find the index in question (S&amp;P 500 in this case) and type in EE. You will get expected earnings at least for the next 2 years and you can extrapolate from there.    d. Riskfree rate: Use the ten-year default free rate in the currency in which your expected growth/cash flows are denominated. For the S&amp;P 500, this would be the 10-year US treasury bond rate.    If you want to carry forward and compare the equity risk premium to the bond default spread, here are the places you can go to get those numbers:    a. For the bond default spreads, visit my favorite macro data source (FRED, the Federal Reserve data site in St. Louis)    http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/    Click on categories first, then on interest rates and then on corporate bond rates. Finally, click on Moody's. You will see Baa rates going back to 1919 (Isn't that awesome?) You have to subtract out the ten-year bond rate and if you want to get that, you should find that on FRED as well. There is a iPhone and iPad app for FRED that you should download. It is free and you can download directly into Excel...    b. For the cap rates, you should try this site:    http://www.realtyrates.com/commentaryg.htm l    I am sure that there are better sources, but most of them require you to pay money. I am cheap..    If after all of this, you still want to read more about equity risk premiums, here is the link to my magnum opus (or something opus), the annual update I do on equity risk premiums:     http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2409198    Download the paper and browse through it. You will see much that is familiar. (The 2015 edition should be out in the next two weeks)   As for betas, the key thing to recognize is that it is a means to an end: a way of adjusting for relative risk. So, keep your eyes on the prize and don't let your disdain for modern portfolio theory get in the way of adjusting for risk and estimating value. The post class test and solution are attached.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        2/19/15    We spent much of today&rsquo;s sessions talking about equity risk premiums, how they have moved over time, both on their own and in relation to other variables such as the risk free rate, the corporate bond default spread and real estate cap rates. The best way to see the relationship is for you to look at the data yourself. So, when you get a chance try the weekly challenge for this week that comes accompanied with an excel spreadsheet containing historical data on equity risk premiums, interest rates and corporate bond default spreads.    Attachment: Implied premium challenge , data        2/20/15    If you have picked a company and collected the basic data (see last week's webcast), you probably more data in front of you then you want. In particular, those of you who have picked US companies have a 10K to read, in all of its bulk. Today's valuation tools webcast is about reading a 10K, with the intent of valuing a company. You can get the webcast by going to:    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/Reading10Knew.mp4    The webcast is accompanied by some supporting material, which you can get below:    Presentation: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/PG/Reading10KPG.pdf    P&amp;G 10K: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/PG/ProcterGamble10K.pdf    P&amp;G valuation: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/PG/P&amp;Gvaluationfixed.xls    This is a longer webcast than I would have preferred it to be.    Two final quick notes. First, if you are having troubles with this class, please do come in and see me. If you are too intimidated to do so (Why? Am I that scary?), you should draw on the TAs for the class and even try their review sessions next week.    Second, I don't mean to scare you but the first quiz is a week from next Wednesday (March 4). If you are interested in starting your preparation for the quiz, you can find every quiz 1 I have ever given in this class and there are a lot of them at the links below:    Past Quiz 1s: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz1.pdf   Past Quiz 2 solutions: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz1sol.xls        2/21/15    I hope that you are enjoying your &ldquo;cold&rdquo; weekend. I am attaching the newsletter for the week, in case you get really, really bored and have absolutely nothing else to do.    Attachment: Newsletter #3        2/22/15    I hope you had a chance to try the weekly challenge. If you did, you probably found it more an exercise in statistics than valuation and that is good. Statistics is a vastly under used tool in valuation. On a different note, we will complete our discussion of bottom up betas and discount rates this week. If you can find a beta page for your company (on Bloomberg or elsewhere) and the business breakdown for your company, you can see the contrast between the regression and bottom up betas for yourself.    Attachment: Weekly Challenge 2a solution        2/23/15    Today's class represented the final pieces of the discount rate puzzle. We began with a continued discussion of bottom up betas, focusing on defining comparable firms and expanding the sample. I did make a big deal about bottom up betas, but may have still not convinced you or left you hazy about some of the details. If so, I thought it might be simpler to just send you a document that I put together on the top ten questions that you may have or get asked about bottom up betas. I think it covers pretty much all of the mechanics of the estimation process, but I am sure that I have missed a few things.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/TenQs/TenQsBottomupBetas.htm   We continued with the cost of debt, starting with a definition of the cost of debt as a long term, current cost of borrowing and laying out a procedure for estimating this cost, even for firms that don't have traded bonds/ bond ratings. We also took a detour into estimating the cost of debt for firms that may receive subsidized debt from the government/ other entities. I am attaching the post class test and solution for today's class.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        2/24/15    This week&rsquo;s valuation is a fun one to do, since the company was started in New York and some of you may have eaten at it. The place to start your valuation is with my overview:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/Valuationofweek/ShakeShack.htm    Follow up with the prospectus:    http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1620533/000104746915000523/a2222881z424b3.htm    Get a sense of what the revenues and margins look like by restaurant:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/restaurants.xls    Then create a narrative for Shake Shack. Is is going to be the Chipotle of the next decade? Cheesecake Factory? Ruby Tuesday? My valuation is in this spreadsheet:     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/ShakeShack2015.xls    I made it Ruby Tuesday-like in terms of revenues, gave it the margins of the 75th percentile restaurant and get a value per share of about $20, about the offering price but well below the current price. Have a go at it and once you have your values, visit the google shared spreadsheet:     https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rCy3PJeddXgMqNKrvh4ZElncpDp7-qzF6bOVafGlSK0/edit?usp=sharing    Have fun with it.        2/25/15    Today's class looked at the getting the base year's earnings right and explored several issues:    1. To get updated numbers, you should be using either trailing 12 month numbers or complete the current year with forecasted numbers. In either case, your objective should be to get the most updated numbers you can for each input rather than be consistent about timing.    2. To clean up earnings, you have to correct accounting two biggest problems: the treatment of operating leases as operating (instead of financial) expenses and the categorization of R&amp;D as operating (instead of capital) expenses. The biggest reason for making these corrections is to get a better sense of how much capital has been invested in the business and how much return this capital is generating.    3. While truly extraordinary items are easy to deal with, accounting ploys to move expenses into the extraordinary column may require some detective work. For those interested in forensic accounting, here are a couple of references:    http://www.amazon.com/Financial-Shenanigans-Accounting-Gimmicks-Reports/dp/0071703071/ref=pd_sim_b_8    http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Cash-Flow-Reporting-Sustainable/dp/0471469181/ref=pd_sim_b_2    Finally, this is an FT article on Amazon from last week that is illustrative of the games that companies play:    http://blogs.ft.com/lex-live/2015/02/19/amazon-in-its-own-words/    If you are really interested in nailing down the basics of cash flows (and preparing for the quiz next week), please try the post-class test (with solution) that is attached but really do try the weekly challenge for this week. It is a great exercise in tying up loose ends.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        2/26/15    With the quiz coming up next Wednesday (March 4), you have probably put the project on the back burner. But just in case you are working on it (and it is great preparation for your quiz), here is where you should be. You should obviously have a company picked and been able to estimate the different pieces that go into the cost of equity: a risk free rate in the currency of your choice, an equity risk premium reflecting where the company operates and a beta, reflecting the businesses it is in. For your debt, you should have a pre-tax cost of debt, based upon an actual or synthetic rating and converted this pre-tax cost of debt into an after-tax cost with a marginal tax rate. Finally, you should be able to use this pre-tax cost of debt, in conjunction with the book value of debt, interest expenses and the &quot;weighted&quot; maturity of the debt to convert the interest bearing debt into a market value.    If you find yourself struggling with the lease and R&amp;D adjustments that we talked about yesterday, do try the weekly challenge, which I have attached to this spreadsheet. Also, if you want to get a start on prepping for the quizzes, you can find every quiz that I have given in the valuation class for the 17 years in the links below, with the solutions.

Remember that you perfect a craft by doing.    Attachments: Weekly challenge #3        2/27/15    I know you are busy doing other stuff, but as the discussion shifts from discount rates to cash flows, the details start mounting and it is easy to get lost in abstractions. If you are interested in getting past abstractions, I have put together three webcasts for this week:    How to compute trailing 12 month earnings: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/Trailing12month.mp4 (Uses Apple from late 2012)    How to convert leases to debt: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/Leases.mp4 (Uses Disney in 2012)    How to capitalize R&amp;D: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/R&amp;D.mp4 (Uses Microsoft annual reports from 2012 &amp; 2011)    They are all about 10-15 minutes each... and you can download the spreadsheets and supporting material by going to     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm   I hope you get a chance (at least after the quiz) to watch one or more of these webcasts.        2/28/15    I hope that I have not ruined your weekend with the impending quiz, but if I have, so be it. I am attaching the newsletter for the week. I also posted a couple of items on my blog that you may find interesting. The first is a listing of what I term twisted DCFs, which have a D and a CF but don&rsquo;t really result in a DCF:     http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/02/dcf-myth-1-if-you-have-ddiscount-rate.html    The second is a post on why I think it is a mistake to keep talking about tech companies as if they shared common characteristics:    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-aging-of-tech-sector-pricing.html    Attachment: Newsletter #4        3/1/15    Next week brings the quiz, with all the angst and stress that quizzes usually bring. Note that the quiz will be in the first 30 minutes (1.30-2) of Wednesday's class and will cover everything through cashflows (about page 145 in the packet). We will not cover growth on this quiz. So ignore them on the past quizzes. What past quizzes, you ask? Here are the links:    Past quizzes: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz1.pdf    Past quiz solutions: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz1sol.xls    It is open book, open notes and open iPad but not open laptops. (Sorry!) If you are going to miss the quiz, you need to let me know before Wednesday at 1.30.    We will spend tomorrow finishing the discussion of cash flows and then start on growth rates, by first looking at the usefulness (or lack thereof) of historical (past) growth. We will then move to both analyst estimates and what I like to term intrinsic or fundamental estimates of growth, which we probably will turn to after the quiz on Wednesday. Yes, there is class after the quiz. Finally, the weekly challenge #3, which I have been nagging you to do, has a solution. I have attached it (with the rating spreadsheet that I needed to get the solution).    Attachment: Solution &amp; Synthetic  rating        3/2/15    Today's class covered a lot of topics, some related to cash flows and some related to growth. Let's start with the cash flow part first. I argued that capital expenditures should be defined broadly to include R&amp;D and acquisitions, for consistency reasons. If you want to count the good stuff (growth) that comes from these investments, you have to also count the cost. To get from cash flow to the firm to cash flow to equity requires us to bring in cash flows to and from debt. While borrowing more can make your cash flows to equity higher, they also make your equity riskier, raising the cost of equity. The net effect of leverage on the value of equity can be positive, negative or neutral, depending on the firm and where it is in its borrowing cycle. On growth, we started with historic growth and quickly dispensed with the notion that it is a fact. Depending on how it is estimated (arithmetic vs geometric) and over what period, you can get different numbers. It is also thrown off when a company's earnings go from negative to positive and generally becomes lower as companies get larger. While you can use analyst forecasts of growth, they have historically not done much better than time series forecasts, perhaps because analysts wear multiple hats.       One final point. As you work through the past quizzes, you will notice a lot of problems that deal with country risk and cost of equity. You will notice that in some of these questions, the answer uses the weighted equity risk premium approach, where you compute the equity risk premium for the risky country or countries, and multiply by the beta. In others, I use the more elaborate lambda approach, with lambda estimated by dividing the proportion of revenues in the country (for the company) by the proportion of the average company in the market.    Cost of equity = Risk free rate + Beta (Mature market premium + Country risk premium(s)); the equity risk premium can be a weighted average across multiple countries.    Cost of equity = Risk free rate + Beta * Mature market premium + Lambda(s) * Country risk premium(s)    Which one should you use? If you are given the data on what the average company makes in an emerging market, I am nudging you towards using a lambda approach. If that is not given, use the more conventional beta approach. Also, if you see an equity risk premium of 5.5% being used when none is given in the problem, that reflects a time period when I used to let people look up the ERP in their lecture notes and that was the historical ERP at the point in time that these quizzes were written.    As for the quiz, it is in the first 30 minutes of Wednesday's class. There will be class after the quiz. So, please hang around, if you finish early. IF YOU WILL NOT BE MAKING THE QUIZ, I NEED TO KNOW BEFORE 1.30 ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. If you are, it is open-book, open-notes but no laptops. You can use your iPads but no connectivity... I have attached the post-class test and solution.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/3/15    have views on: Apple. As you may know, I have been posting on Apple a long time on my blog and rather than point you to every post, I will point you to a long post from April of last year, where I referenced all my earlier posts and valuations of Apple:    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/04/watch-gap-apples-long-and-twisted.html    Once you have read this post, where I argued that Apple was approaching a full valuation in April, fast forward to the most updated numbers for Apple in this link:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/AppleFAMarch2015.pdf    Finally, here is my latest valuation of Apple:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/AppleMarch2015.xls    Play with it and make your own judgments on growth, margins, trapped cash and risk. Once you have a number, go in and add it to the shared Google spreadsheet:    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v3RCLLJwKrOperClX73cinO8uN4vpk6ocs9HSUR6JoM/edit?usp=sharing   You may want to do this after the quiz but it will give you some talking points when you are sitting at the beach on Caribbean resort trying to impress someone with your investment acumen.        3/4/15    The quizzes are done and you can pick them on the ninth floor of KMEC. As you come of the elevators, head towards the main doors and before you get to the doors, look to your right and you should see a table. You will see two (neat) piles in alphabetical order, face down. Please pick up only your quiz. I have attached the solution (with the grading template) and the distribution. If you have any issues with the grading of your quiz, please come an see me and don&rsquo;t go to the TAs. I will be in some of tomorrow and day after.    Attachments: First    quiz , the solution and the distribution of  grades.        3/4/15    I won't ask you how the first quiz went because that may evoke the wrong response. The good news is that it is over. If you were able to hang in there mentally and physically, we did complete our discussion of growth by looking at the fundamentals that drive growth. Starting with a very simple algebraic proof that growth in earnings has to come either from new investments or improved efficiency, we looked at how best to estimate growth in three measures of earnings: earnings per share, net income and operating income. With each measure of earnings, the estimation of growth boiled down to answering three questions: (1) How much is this company reinvesting to generating for future growth? (2) How well is it reinvesting? (3) How much growth is added or lost by changes in returns on existing investments? The weekly challenge for this week revolves around fundamental growth. Try it, if you get a chance. I have also attached the post class test and solution for today's class. Hope you get a chance!    Harking back to the quiz again, I am truly sorry for not sending you the review session. I know that it is too late for this quiz, but if you did badly, you may still find it useful (albeit frustrating).     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/valquiz1review.mp4    The supporting presentation for the quiz is at the link listed below:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pptfiles/val3E/valquiz1review.pptx    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/5/15    I hope that most of you have picked up your quizzes. I will leave them out until Monday but please do pick them up, if you have not already. You are probably in no mood for more valuation, but if you are, I would spend some time estimating the &quot;secret number&quot; in valuation: the return on invested capital and/or return on equity. Here are the steps:    1. Start by getting the current year's operating income and net income. Do all of the things we talked about last week including    - removing any one time charges or income    - update the numbers to make them current    - see if you can find out the interest income earned on cash and multiply by (1-tax rate). If you cannot find it, just multiply last year's cash balance by the treasury bill rate during the year.    Your preliminary estimate of income will be:    After-tax operating income = Operating income (1- Effective tax rate)    Net Income from non-cash assets = Net Income - Interest income from cash (1- tax rate)    2. Go to the balance sheet for the prior year (if you are doing trailing 12 months, go to the same quarter of the previous year)    - Get the shareholders' equity (this can be negative for some firms)    - Add up the interest bearing debt on the balance sheet (short term and long term debt)    - Get the cash balance    Your preliminary estimate of invested capital    Invested capital = Shareholders equity + Total Debt - Cash    Your preliminary estimate of book value of equity in non-cash assets will be    Book equity from non-cash assets = Book equity - Cash    3. Adjust for leases &amp; R&amp;D    - Adjust the operating income and net income for leases &amp; R&amp;D    - Adjust the book debt for the PV of operating leases    - Adjust the book equity for unamortized R&amp;D    Recompute your invested capital    4. Compute your ROE, non-cash ROE and ROIC    ROE = Net Income/ BV of equity    Non-cash ROE = Net Income from non-cash assets/ Book equity from non-cash assets    ROIC or ROC = After-tax operating income/ Invested Capital    You may get strange looking numbers. For instance, for some firms with large cash balances, your ROIC can be astronomical or negative. For young, growth firms, the ROIC and ROE can be negative. Don't freak out. You still have the power to override these numbers, when you make your forecasts for the future. In other words, what you really care about is ROE and ROIC on future new investments and you are not bound to use last year's numbers. If you are looking at industry averages for these numbers, they are on my website under updated data.    We also talked about items like goodwill and restructuring charges that can throw you off. If you are interested, here is the sleep-provoking paper of mine on ROE and ROIC that you will find absolutely engrossing (NOT!!!):    http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1105499        3/6/15    This week, we focused on estimating growth from fundamentals and built growth rates from accounting returns - return on equity and return on invested capital. Accounting returns can be messy and misleading. In this webcast (that some of you may remember from the corporate finance class), I look at the process of estimating accounting returns, using Walmart as my example:    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/ROIC.mp4    Walmart 10K (2013): http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/ROIC/walmart10K.pdf    Walmart 10K (2012): http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/ROIC/walmart10Klastyear.pdf    Spreadsheet: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/cfovhds/webcasts/ROIC/walmartreturncalculator.xls    I hope you get a chance to take a look at it.    I have also attached this week&rsquo;s challenge, though you are probably burnt out after the quiz. If you do get a chance, give it a shot. It is also centered around estimating fundamental growth for a company.        3/7/15    Finally, it looks like we have a weekend that we can actually be outside and I hope you get a chance. Two very quick notes. First, the newsletter for the week is attached. Second, the second and third packets are ready to download online.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm   Look to the top of the page. The bookstore should also have a combined packet that includes packets 2 and 3 on their shelves right now, if you want to skip downloading and printing on your own.    Attachment: Newsletter #5        3/8/15    I hope that you had a chance to try the weekly challenge (I know.. I know.. No chance.. but no harm trying).... I have attached thes solution to this email. Just a heads up that this week, we will turn our attention to that big number in every DCF valuation, the terminal value, as well as how best to pick the right DCF model to value your company. If you want to get started on the DCF valuation for your company, it is a good week to get started or moving.    Attachment: Solution to weekly challenge #4        3/9/15    The heart of today's class was the discussion of terminal value. We began by ruling out using multiples to get terminal values, at least in the context of intrinsic value. To keep terminal values in check, you have to follow four basic rules/principles:    1. Constrain your terminal growth rate to be less than or equal to your riskfree rate (which is a proxy for long term growth in the economy)    2. Don't wait too long to put your company into stable growth (and try not to push past 10 years)    3. The key input in your terminal value computation is your return on capital (and excess return assumption). If your return on capital = cost of capital, your terminal growth rate does not add any value.    4. Give your company the characteristics of a stable growth company in terms of excess returns and cost of capital.    As for which model is right for you, use a firm valuation model if you believe that debt ratios will change over time or are not sure and reserve the dividend discount model for desperate times (when you lack the inputs to compute cash flows).   I have attached the post class test &amp; solution for today's class.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/10/15    Given that you just got your quiz back and probably want to get to work on your DCF valuation. So, I decided to go off on a tangent and reuse an offbeat assessment that I did on Bitcoin about a year ago. Like me, you have probably been watching Bitcoin go from $13 to $1000 and back down to $280 and wondered not only what was driving the price but what exactly it was. In my post a year ago, when Bitcoin was at $640, I pondered whether Bitcoin had a future and what its value was:    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/03/bitcoin-q-bubble-or-breakthrough-both.html    The numbers in the post may be dated but try to make your own judgments on four issues:    1. Do you think Bitcoin is a currency?    2. If no, what is it? (An equity instrument, a credit card, a scam)    3. Would you buy Bitcoin for a transaction? (I have a list of vendors who accept Bitcoin, in my post, and lay out the process for acquiring Bitcoin)    4. Would you trade in Bitcoin at today's price?    Finally, I looked at five currencies: the US $, the Chinese Yuan, the Argentine Peso, Gold and Bitcoin as competing currencies and given my priors, I ranked them as follows from best to worst as a currency that I would like to be paid in or in my pocket in any part of the world: US dollar, Gold, Chinese Yuan, Bitcoin, Argentine Peso. Please make your own rankings. Once you have them, go to this shared google spreadsheet and give me your views:    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Alt0SdORYnWadDdkQ3hobGdTdjNzSzgzQTdfUmNWRGc&amp;usp=sharing        3/11/15    Today's class was about the loose ends in valuation, items we often pay little heed to or attach arbitrary premiums/discounts for. We began by looking at cash and whether it should command a premium at some companies (if they have a good track record and have restrictions on raising capital) and a discount at others (if investors don't trust you with the cash). We then looked at cross holdings in other companies and the numerous barriers to valuing them. Third, we looked at other assets and argued that you should never double count assets. I have attached the post class test and solution.    On a different note, please do get a jump on the DCF valuation of your firm. The valuation is due on April 3 but only for feedback, not grading. So, don't feel the pressure to get it right. Just get it done. I have also attached the weekly challenge for this week, though this is little chance that you will be able to do it, on spring break. I will give a longer window than usual for submissions, and not send you the solution until March 23. Just one more email later today with the to do list for the valuation and I will then leave you to your own devices (I promise).    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/12/15    s you take for different parts of the world, I know that the last thing you want to think about is your DCF valuation. Anyway, I thought I would lend a helping hand:    1. Model building versus Model borrowing: This is not a modeling class and I am fine with you borrowing and adapting my models. If you decide to build your own model, keep it simple. Please do not use investment banking valuation models that you may have borrowed from a prior, current or summer job. Not only do they add detail, where you need none, but they often have fundamental mistakes built into them.    2. Which model should I use? First, go through the slides from a couple of sessions ago where we developed a roadmap for picking the right model. Once you have decided whether you want to use dividends, FCFE or FCFF, here is my suggestion. For companies where operating margins are not likely to change dramatically, use one of the ginzu models on my website. They are versatile and will do a lot a great deal of your dirty work (capitalizing R&amp;D, converting leases to debt, taking care of management options) for you. For companies where margins are likely to change over time or companies with negative earnings, use the higrowth.xls spreadsheet (even if you do not expect high growth). In particular, stick with the following choices:    a. fcffginzu.xls: if you are doing a FCFF valuation of a firm that has positive operating income and you do not expect dramatic shifts in margins (and return on capital) over time    b. fcffsimpleginzu.xls: if you are doing a FCFF valuation for a money losing firm or a high growth firm or want to allow your margins to change over time. (This is the most general model of the four.)    c. fcfeginzu.xls: if you are doing a FCFE valuation of a firm that has positive net income and you do not expect dramatic shifts in margins and leverage over time    d. divginzu.xls: for financial service firms    You can find all four of these under spreadsheets on my website.    Let me clarify, though, what I would like to get from you when you turn it in:    1. Each of you can turn in your valuation individually. You do not have to submit as a group.    2. All I want is a base case valuation of your firm. It will be easiest if you submit the excel spreadsheet containing your valuation and include your assumptions page in the same spreadsheet.    3. There is no hard copy required and you can submit your DCF valuation spreadsheet electronically. But please do the following:    In the subject enter: &quot;My perfect DCF Valuation&quot;. Do not deviate from the script or my filtering program will dump your email into my general email pile.    In the email text, specify the name of the company that you are valuing (yes, there are people who have submitted valuations of unnamed companies), the price per share that the stock is trading at on the day of your valuation and your estimate of value per share.    4. Your DCF valuation will not be graded. I will review the valuation and send you back your own spreadsheet with my comments embedded in the spreadsheet. Some of the comments will be suggestions (which you are free to ignore) and some will be stronger than suggestions (and these should probablyy not be ignored).    5. If you don't get back your valuation within 48 hours of submitting it, please send me another email to let me know. My filtering program sometimes works in mysterious ways.    6. If you get done before April 4, go ahead and send your valuation in early.    So, don't freak out about this deadline. It is more feedback on your valuation than judgment day...    Finally, if you are one of those people who likes checklists, I have attached one of those as well. Hope you find it useful.    Attachments: Dividend Discount Model , FCFE Discount Model , FCFF Discount Model , General FCFF Model , Valuation Checklist        3/21/15    I hope that your spring break was great but the bad news is that it is almost over. I don't mean to be the skunk at your party, but it is my duty to remind you that your DCF valuation is due for feedback by April 3. If you are working on it or plan to work on it, you will undoubtedly find that errors you make on your terminal value can drown out all of the good work that you do in estimating your inputs. I have a webcast that you may find useful in checking your terminal value (or someone else's estimate of terminal value). I hope you get a chance to check it out.    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/terminalvalue.mp4    Terminal value DCF (for use with the webcast): http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/webcasts/TermValueCheck/termvalueDCF.xls    Terminal value analyzer: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/webcasts/TermValueCheck/termvaluecheck.xls    Finally, if you want to see how this works in practice, take a look at the attached equity research report on Tesla from Morgan Stanley. Skip through the first 40 pages (they are impressive but a distraction) and go to page 41 to the DCF valuation. Put the terminal value to the test (using both the EBITDA multiple and the perpetual growth model used by the analyst). I am also attaching the newsletter for this week.    Attachments: Newsletter #6        3/22/15    Hope you are back and raring to go (Right... But no harm hoping...)! Anyway, ready or not, we are back to work tomorrow. After tying up a couple more loose ends (complexity, debt to net out of firm value to get to equity value and employee options/restricted stock), we will start on a series of valuations. We will begin easy, using a stable growth dividend discount model to value Con Ed, move up the difficulty ladder to value 3M with a FCFF model before and just after the 2008 market crisis and follow up with a valuation of the S&amp;P 500 at the start of 2015. We will then move into what I call the dark side of valuation, looking at difficult to value companies across the life cycle (from start up to decline), across sectors (financial service, cyclical, commodity) and across markets. If you are having trouble with your DCF valuation, odds are that we will address that issue in the context of valuing some other company in the next few sessions. I am also attaching the solution to the weekly challenge for this week. While you probably did not get a chance to work through the challenge, please do take a look at it since it relates to DCF's biggest number, the terminal value.        3/23/15    Today, we put the last two loose ends to rest. First, wwe went back and looked at defining debt. While we used a narrow definition of debt, when computing cost of capital, we argued for using a broader definition of debt, when subtracting from firm value to get to equity value. Next, we talked about how best to deal with both currently outstanding employee options and potential options grants in the future. With the former, we argued for using an option pricing model to value the options and netting that value out of equity value, before dividing by the number of shares outstanding. With the latter, we suggested incorporating the expected cost into the operating expenses, thus lowering future earnings and cash flows.    We then started on our first valuation, Con Ed, using a stable growth dividend discount model. To qualify to be valued with this model, we argued that a company had to meet three criteria: have a high payout ratio, have a fundamental growth rate less than that of the economy (or the risk free rate) and a beta close to one. We will continue with more valuations in Wednesday&rsquo;s session. If you are interested in downloading the excel spreadsheets with these valuations, you can get them here:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/covalsSpr2015.htm   I have also attached the post class tests/solutions for today.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/24/15    I am sorry to get this to you so late in the day but I was otherwise occupied. The company that I valued this week is CRH, an Irish company. If you have never heard of it, I don&rsquo;t blame you because I had not either. It is the third largest construction company in the world and you can start by reading the Bloomberg description of the company.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHBloomberg.pdf    You can then check the financial history of the company and its current bond rating, again using Bloomberg summaries:    Financial Summary: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHBloombergFA.pdf    Bond/Debt Rating: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHBloombergDebt.pdf    Finally, take a look at the annual report for 2014 for the company, which contains information on geography and product segments:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHAnnualReport.pdf    My valuation of CRH from earlier today (fresh of the press) is at the link below.    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHAnnualReport.pdf    You are probably wondering why I picked such a boring company to analyze and here is where it gets interesting. As part of a merger of Lafarge and Holcim, two European construction/engineering companies, those companies were required by the EU to shed assets and CRH was the acquirer.    Story on merger: http://www.wsj.com/articles/holcim-lafarge-confirm-asset-sale-talks-with-crh-1422859051    Story on asset purchase: http://www.wsj.com/articles/crh-confirms-6-5-billion-deal-to-buy-holcim-lafarge-assets-1422807500    We know that CRH paid 6.5 billion Euros for the assets and that the assets generate 6 billion Euros revenues in Asia, Latin America, UK and Canada. That is a big investment and if you are valuing CRH, you are probably at a loss on how to incorporate the effect of this asset acquisition into the value. Here is how I did it and you can take issue with it. I treated it like a capital budgeting project and estimated earnings and cash flows, based upon the average across construction companies globally for EBITDA margins and working capital. The present value of my cash flows came in at 6.27 billion Euros, about 230 million Euros less than what CRH paid for them.     http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/CRHassetacquisition.xlsx    It is true that my estimates are based upon very limited information but it illustrates a simple process for dealing with add on actions. Since this may happen with the firms that you are valuing, please take a look at what I have done. It may be helpful. Finally, if you do try your hand at the valuation, you can input your numbers into the shared Google spreadsheet:    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KEiIkbOJxZlDYDfhRMduxeyQbpBLJS0VI31HAEQsDXI/edit?usp=sharing        3/25/15    In today's class, we started with two conventional valuations, one of 3M and the other of the S&amp;P 500. We then talked about the valuaton of young, growth companies by emphasizing that you will be wrong 100% of the time and that it was okay, because the market is usually even more wrong. Next session, we will continue with the discussion by looking at mature companies. Overall, we are approaching the end of the DCF section of this class. If you have not printed off packet 2 of the lecture notes, please do so or buy the packet at the bookstore (you will get packets 2 &amp; 3 consolidated). We will be getting to it next week. I have also attached the weekly challenge for this week (built around management options) and the post class test and solution.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/26/15    So, where are you in the DCF process? I hope that you have picked a company, collected the financials and actually tried to do a base case. A piece of advice. Get a base case valuation going with just minimal information (last annual report or 10K) and come back to it with more details. I have reattached the valuation checklist I sent you a couple of weeks ago, since you may find it more useful now. In case, you have forgotten which spreadsheets work best if you want to start with one of mine, you should stick with the ginzu versions:    a. fcffginzu.xls: For a firm with stable operating income and return on capital: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/fcffginzu2015.xls    b. fcffsimpleginzu.xls: For a money losing firm or a high growth firm or want to allow your margins to change over time (This is the most general model and you can use it for almost any non-financial service firm): http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/fcffsimpleginzu2015.xls    c. fcfeginzu.xls: For valuing a firm using the FCFE approach: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/fcfeginzu2015.xls    d. divginzu.xls: for financial service firms and perhaps REITs/MLPs: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/divginzu2015.xls    Finally, if yesterday&rsquo;s session provoked or rekindled your interest in Amazon, you may find this blog post I had in October 2014 interesting (because it not only compares my forecasts from 2000 to the actual numbers at the company but also provides an updated valuation):    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/10/if-you-build-it-revenues-they-profits.html    Attachments: Valuation Checklist        3/27/15    As you work on your perfect DCF valuations, employee options that your company has granted and continues to grant may be a source of imperfection. I know that we went through the mechanics in class. First, value the outstanding options, using an option pricing model. Second, subtract the value of the options from the equity value that you estimated in a DCF. Third, divide the remaining value by the number of shares outstanding (the actual number, not the diluted number). The mechanics of doing this can be tricky and that is why this week's weekly challenge is built around options. After you have tried the challenge, you may also want to watch this webcast that I put together on doing this in practice. I used Cisco, a monster option granter, to illustrate the mechanics. You can find the links below:    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/Employeeoptions.mp4    Cisco 10K: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/webcasts/EmployeeOptions/cisco10K.pdf    Spreadsheet for options: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/webcasts/EmployeeOptions/ciscooptions.xls   I hope you get a chance to watch the webcast and that you find it useful.        3/28/15    If you have finished your DCF and sent it to me, thank you! You should be hearing from me soon. If you are working on your DCF right now, I am sorry for distracting you. Please get back to work. If your question is &ldquo;what DCF&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you. No matter what you are doing, the newsletter is attached.    Attachment: Newsletter #  7 (March 28)        3/29/15    News on two fronts. The first is that the solution to the option weekly challenge is attached. If you are at all confused about valuing employee options, I would check it out. The second is an update on the week to come. We will start tomorrow by looking at other companies on the dark side of valuation, including distressed companies, cyclical companies and emerging market companies. On Wednesday, we will (hopefully) finish our discussion of packet 1. If you can, please download, print or buy packets 2/3. They are both ready to download online:    Packet 2: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/packet2spr15.pdf    Packet 3: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/packet3spr15.pdf    You can also get the powerpoint versions on the website for the class:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm    Look to the top of the page.   Also, not to be a nag, but please do work on your DCFs and get them to me by Friday.    Attachments: Weekly Challenge #5: Solution &amp; Option value        3/30/15    In today's session, we started with the depressing job of valuing declining and distressed companies, moved on to emerging market companies and ended with financial service companies. We are almost to the end of the DCF process now with only a couple of loose ends to tie up. Next session, we will look at the difference between value and price, what it tells us and what it does not. The post class test and solution are attached.    On a different note, please do work on your DCF valuations this week and try to get them to me by Friday. I could draw lines in the sand (by 5 pm Friday, or else) but I will not. So, do your best and I will do mine.    Attachments: Post class test and solution        3/31/15    In keeping with my exhortations to you to go where it is darkest, I decided to value Lukoil, a Russian oil company. You can start by reviewing the blog post that I had in November 2014 about Lukoil and Vale:    http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/11/go-where-it-is-darkest-when-company.html    You can follow up with this updated summary of where Lukoil stands today (from Bloomberg):    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/LukoilBloombergMarch15.pdf    You can back up the Bloomberg numbers and get more details by downloading the Lukoil annual report for 2014 (it is in English):    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/LukoilAnnualReport.pdf    You can check out my valuation of Lukoil from March 2015:    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/LukoilMarch2015.xls    Finally, you can tweak, modify or adjust the numbers to arrive at your own estimate of value for Lukoil and enter them in the shared Google spreadsheet:    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBOe327TnpycL-2dUorG2fX3x1t6zCsS2Gx9pldxV1c/edit?usp=sharing        4/1/15    In today's class, we finally put to rest DCF by having a discussion of the difference between value and price, why they might be different and when the gap will close. Before entering into that discussion by talking about the values of intangible asset companies and commodity/cyclical companies. With the latter, we noted the importance of keeping separate our macro views (about the economy or commodity) from our micro views, and the use of Monte Carlo simulations to deal with uncertainty. During that discussion, I talked about a paper that I have on statistical distributions and the link is below:     http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/papers/probabilistic.pdf    We ended the class by starting the discussion of multiples and comparable firms. We will continue that discussion after the second quiz. I have put the review session up online (on the webcast page for the class) with the presentation. The links are below:    Presentation: http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/valquiz2review.pdf    Webcast: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/podcasts/Webcasts/valquiz2review.mp4    You can also find all past quizzes with the solutions in the following links:    All past quiz 2s: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz2.pdf    Quiz 2 solutions: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/eqexams/quiz2sol.xls   You will see relative valuation problems (multiples) popping up in the pre-2008 quizzes. You can ignore them!    Attachments: Post class test and solution        4/2/15    I know that it seems like I am piling on, with your DCF due tomorrow and your quiz on Monday and I am sorry. However, I will not harass you too much today.    1. DCF: Please remember to put &quot;My Perfect DCF&quot; in the subject, when you send your DCF to me. All you have to send is your spreadsheet, with questions and comments embedded in it (if you have any)    2. Quiz: The quiz review, presentation and links to past quizzes were in yesterday's email (which I just resent). In case you did not get it or my retry, you can also get them by going to    http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcasteqspr15.htm        4/3/15    As I check my mailbox, I see that most of you have turned in your DCF valuations. I appreciate the effort and will get them back to you as soon as I can. I spent all day yesterday adn the day before grading corporate finance quizzes which came due on Wednesday and have not had a chance to look at the DCFs but I promise that I will get them back to you soon. There is no valuation tools webcast this week, as we take a break to get ready for the quiz. However, if you really miss the weekly challenges, I have attached the one for this week but it is on multiples (and hence not on your quiz). I will see you Monday at 1.30. Please don't be late and if you are going to miss the quiz, let me know ahead of 1.30    Attachments: Weekly challenge #6        4/4/15    Just in case you run out of things to do this weekend, the newsletter is attached. I am working my way through your valuations and will try to get them to you by Monday.    Attachment: Newsletter#  8 (April 4)        4/5/15    We have the quiz tomorrow in the first 30 minutes, followed by a continuation of the discussion of relative valuation. We will look at defining, describing and analyzing multiples. Please bring packet 2 to class tomorrow. Until next time! (I am also attaching the solution to weekly challenge #6 on the off chance that you tried it).    Attachment: Weekly Challenge #6 Solution        4/6/15    By now, all but a handful of you (I think I have about 8 DCFs left to do) should have received back your DCF valuation back. If you don&rsquo;t hear back by tomorrow, please send it again to me. Rather than make myself into an all-knowing oracle (which I am not), t thought I would take you through the process I used to diagnose your DCF valuations.    Input page checks    Step 1: Currency check: What currency is this company being valued in and is the riskfree rate consistent with that currency?    Right now, if you are valuing a company in US dollars, I would expect to see a riskfree rate of about 2% here.. though some of you used 30-year bonds rates which would give you a slightly higher value). if you are valuing your company in pesos or rubles, I would expect to see a higher riskfree rate, (Watch out for the tricky ones.. a Mexican company being valued in US dollars or a Russian company in Euros.. Your riskfree rates should revert back to 0.2%, if this is the case)    Step 2: ERP check: Is the equity risk premium being used consistent with where the market is right now and where this company has its operations?    If you are analyzing a company with operations only in developed markets, I would expect to see a number of about 5.5-6% here... That is because the current implied premium in the US is about 5.7% (April 2015). If you are using a premium of 4%, you will over value your company. If your company is exposed to emerging market risk, I would expect to see something added to the mature market premium. While I begin with the presumption that where your company is incorporated is a significant factor in this decision, it should not be the only one in this decision. Coca Cola and Nestle should have some emerging market risk built into them.    Step 3: Units check: Are the inputs in consistent units?    Scan the input page. All inputs should be in the same units - thousands, millions, billions whatever... What you are looking are units with far too many digits to make sense. (Check the number of shares. It is the input that is most often at variance with the rest, usually because you use a different source for it than the financial statements)    Step 4: Normalization check: If earnings are being normalized, what is the normalized value relative to the current value? If reinvestment numbers are off, should they have been normalized as well?    In some cases, we normalize earnings by looking at historical average earnings or industry average margins. While this is perfectly defensible, you want to make sure that the normalization is working properly. Thus, if earnings of $ 3 million are being replaced with earnings of $ 3 billion, you want to make sure that this company has generated earnings like these in the past. You may also want to consider an alternative which is to allow margins to change gradually over time rather than replace current with normalized earnings.    As a follow up, check the reinvestment rate for the firm. If it a weird number (900%, -100% etc.), it may be because something strange happened in the base year (a huge acquisition, a dramatic drop in working capital). A better choice may be to average over time.    Output page checks:    a. High Growth Period.    Start by checking the length of the growth period and the cash flows during the growth period. In particular,    - Compare the FCFF (or FCFE) to the EBIT (1-t) (or Net Income). Especially if you are forecasting cap ex, working capital and depreciation independently, compute an implied reinvestment rate    Implied Reinvestment Rate = 1 - FCFF/ (EBIT (1-t)   or 1 - FCFE/ Net Income    Thus, if you have after-tax operating income of 100 and FCFF of 95, your implied reinvestment rate is 5%.    - Look at the expected growth rate over the period. Does it jive with your reinvestment rate? (If you see a high growth rate with a low reinvestment rate, the only way you can justify it is by calling on efficiency growth. For that argument to make sense, your current return on capital has to be a low number... See the attached excel spreadsheet that computes efficiency growth.    - If you are forecasting operating income, cap ex, depreciation and working capital as individual line items, back out your imputed return on capital:    Imputed Return on Capital = Expected EBIT (1-t)/ (Base Year Capital Invested + Sum of all reinvestment through year t-1)    If you see this number taking off through the roof or dropping towards zero by the time you get to year 10, your reinvestment assumptions are unreasonable.    b. Terminal value    Start by checking to make sure your growth rate forever does not exceed your riskfree rate. Then follow up by    - Examining your reinvestment rate in your terminal year, using the same formula we used in high growth    - Backing out your implied return on capital (ROC = g/ Reinvestment Rate)    - Checking against your cost of capital in stable growth (you don't want to get more than 5% higher than the cost of capital and you do not want to set it lower than the cost of capital forever)    I have a spreadsheet that can help in this diagnostic (and there is a webcast that you can use as well from a few weeks ago)    One common error to watch out for is estimates of terminal value that use the cash flow in the final year, grow it out at the stable growth rate. That locks in your reinvestment rate from your last high growth year forever.    c. Cost of capital    As a general rule, your cost of capital should be consistent with your growth assumptions. Thus, you should expect to see betas move towards the stable range (0.8-1.2) and your debt ratios to rise towards industry average. Thus, your cost of capital in stable growth should be different from the cost of capital in high growth.    d. Final value of equity    Check for danger signs, including    - Cash and cross holdings becoming a huge percentage of value    - Options either being ignored or being a huge number    Market Price    As a final sanity check, look at the current market price. If your value is not even in the ballpark, go back and repeat all of the earlier steps...    Try it out with your own DCF valuation and then offer to do it for a friend... Then, take your toolkit on the road. Pick up a valuation done by an investment bank or equity research analyst and see if you can diagnose any problems in them. You are well on your way to being a valuation guru. I have also attached a full set of diagnostic questions that you can consider in the context of valuation to this email. Until next time!    Attachments: Growth Check , Terminal Value Check , Post Mortem        4/6/15    Your quizzes and are ready to be picked. Please take just your quiz, leave the pile in alphabetical order and don&rsquo;t browse. I have attached the solution and the grading distribution. As always, if there is a screw up, it is my fault. Please bring your quizzes in and I will fix my mistake.    Attachments: Solution as    well as the distribution of  grades        4/7/15    I meant to send this yesterday but events got ahead of me. This week, I turn to pricing and to how the price you attach to a company (or any asset) will depend on the comparables that you use. I use Amgen and the healthcare sector to illustrate my point. I have attached spreadsheets containing (1) all health care firms, (2) only firms that are categorized as pharmaceuticals by Cap IQ and (3) only firms that are categorized as biotech by Cap IQ. The spreadsheets include about ten multiples computed for each firm, ranging from standard PE to EV/Sales. In a very simple exercise, I then pick PE to illustrate its weakness in this sector and also its distributional properties and price Amgen, relative to both pharma and biotech companies. It is the most sophisticated exercise in the world, but it indicates how different your conclusions can be. If you really want to explore multiples, try EV/Sales and see what you get as a comparison.    Attachments: The Healthcare Sector (US): Raw company data , The Pharmaceuticals: PE Ratio Distribution and Statistics , The Biotechnology firms: PE Ratio Distribution and Statistics , Pricing Amgen as a pharma company and then as a biotech company        4/8/15    In today's class, we extended our analysis of multiples by first looking at PE and PEG ratios, then moving on to PBV ratios and finally examining enterprise value multiples: EV/Invested Capital, EV/EBITDA and EV/Sales. In particular, we noted that the drivers for EV multiples are analogs of the equity multiples: growth in operating income replacing growth in net income, reinvestment rates replacing payout ratios, ROC replacing ROE and cost of capital replacing cost of equity. There is a simple way to find the companion variable (the key driver) for a multiple. With an equity multiple, you can get this variable by dividing the net income by the denominator of the multiple. With an enterprise value, you divide after-tax operating income by the denominator of the multiple. With the EV/Sales ratio, this yields the after-tax operating margin as the determining variable. We used that measure to evaluate the value of a brand name, by comparing the pricing of Coca Cola with its current operating margin with its value with a generic margin. Finally, I am attaching the post class test/solution for today as well as the weekly challenge for this week. Until next time!    Attachments: Post class test and solution        4/9/15    As promised (or threatened), the mystery project is ready for you. It is a group project, due two weeks from today (Wednesday, April 24, at 5 pm). The assignment is a pretty straightforward one, and the write up should be brief and to the point. Be creative, use statistics as a tool and don't be afraid to be different.... I have attached the project description and the data that you will need (it is also online on the webcast page for the class and under the main menu for the class... will also be posted on iTunes U).    Attachments: The mystery project , Data for mystery project        4/10/15    One of the most confusing aspects of multiples is dealing with the variants of value out there: firm value, enterprise value and equity value.

BUTTERNUT SQUASH MACARONI AND CHEESE     February is Heart Health Month; an important time for promoting awareness and sharing life-saving tools related to cardiovascular disease. Currently, in this country, heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. Fortunately, making healthy meal choices can make a significant difference in helping you to avoid heart disease and its complications. Choosing foods that are low in saturated fat and high in fiber can help prevent high cholesterol. Similarly, limiting salt in your diet can serve to lower blood pressure.     With that in mind, this dish couldn&rsquo;t come at a more perfect time. Butternut squash mac and cheese offers a healthy twist on a comfort-food classic, satisfying even the pickiest of palates while simultaneously offering a nutritional punch. This hearty entree retains the color and creaminess of traditional macaroni and cheese, while losing the gratuitous fat that the old school version so often comes with.     The star of this dish, butternut squash, is low in fat and high in dietary fiber, potassium, and vitamin A. On top of that, it is naturally high in carotenoids, known to protect against heart disease, making this dish particularly fitting for heart health month. If that weren&rsquo;t enough, butternut squash is known for being rich in antioxidants. A single serving of this deliciousness will provide a significant amount of antioxidant-rich vitamin C, working to help your body reduce inflammation and boost your immune system at the same time.     Serves 8   Nutritional analysis (per serving) 224 calories, 4g fat, 3g fiber, 10g protein     Ingredients:   3 cups butternut squash, cubed and peeled   1&frasl;2 cup reduced sodium chicken broth   1&frasl;2 cup skim milk   2 garlic cloves   1&frasl;4 cup plain non-fat Greek yogurt   1&frasl;2 teaspoon black pepper   3&frasl;4 cup shredded gruyere cheese   1&frasl;4 grated parmesan cheese   1&frasl;8 cup bread crumbs   3 cups whole wheat penne noodles     Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large pot, combined cubed butternut squash, chicken broth, milk and garlic and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes, until squash is tender. Remove from heat. Add Greek yogurt, pepper and using an immersion blender, puree until smooth (alternatively, you could add the mixture to a blender or food processer). Stir in gruyere cheese until melted and then fold in pasta. Pour everything into a 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Bake for 18-22 minutes. Remove from oven and turn oven to Broil. Sprinkle parmesan cheese and bread crumbs over pasta and return to oven for an additional 5-7 minutes until cheese has browned and noodle edges are crispy.       3) CAN I DRIVE?     By: Kimberly Parker-Menzer, NP      For many, driving is a vital function of everyday life. However, if you experience seizures that involve alteration in or loss of consciousness or body control, your legal right to drive may be restricted. The good news is that having had a seizure in one&rsquo;s lifetime is not a permanent obstacle to driving.     It is important to understand that the state that issued your driver&rsquo;s license determines the criteria for operating a motor vehicle with a history of seizures. A general fact common to all state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is the restriction for an individual having active seizures involving alteration in or loss of consciousness. The required &ldquo;seizure free&rdquo; period before a license is reinstated varies from state to state, however many average six months. Individuals with epilepsy must notify the licensing state of their medical history when applying for a driver&rsquo;s license, as well as when renewing. Your provider can review the state law with you in regards to your specific condition, and will instruct you not to drive according to the state law if applicable. Furthermore, mandatory physician reporting is required in some, but not all states. This means that in some states either the emergency room physician treating you after a seizure or your neurologist is required by law to report your seizure to the DMV. While other states may not have this requirement, providers, as well as anyone, can report seizures to the DMV on a case by case basis if there is concern that someone who is experiencing active seizures is continuing to drive. As a licensed driver, you are legally responsible for following the rules of the body that has authorized you to drive. &ldquo;Medical review forms&rdquo; provided by your state DMW, help your practitioner to make recommendations to the DMV as to when he/she believes you are cleared to drive, however the final determination is made by the DMV.     Unfortunately, there have been many cases when an individual with epilepsy has driven against medical and DMV recommendations, or during a time when they are at high risk for seizures (after missing meds, consuming alcohol the night prior, with sleep deprivation) and accidents have occurred. Many such accidents have resulted in injury or death to the driver or innocent others on the road. Individuals with epilepsy should use common sense when they have been cleared to drive by the DMV and avoid driving after missing meds, while sleep deprived, and the day after consuming more than two alcoholic beverages&mdash;as these are times when they are more apt to experience a seizure. Driving under the aforementioned circumstances is taking a chance not only with one&rsquo;s life, but with all others that share the road. At the minimum, there are legal ramifications of any accident, and the worst case scenarios can shatter lives. While all who live with or treat individuals with epilepsy advocate for life without restrictions, DMV laws regarding driving with epilepsy are to protect all on the road.. including YOUR loved ones.. and should be abided by.     For more information regarding the DMV laws in your state, or to access medical review forms, please look on your state DMV website.       4) FACES CLUB      FACES has received a lot of feedback from the epilepsy and seizure community suggesting ways in which patients and their siblings can get more involved in volunteering, raising awareness and funds for our organization. In addition, many of our FACES parents frequently call the office looking for community service projects for their children. With these requests in mind, we are pleased to announce the launch of the FACES Club Starter Kit. The premise is simple &ndash; uniting a group of students who are interested in the common goal of raising epilepsy and seizure awareness as well as funds at their school. Please click here to download a copy of our starter kit and one sheet . It is chock full of information on how to start a club at your school! Note that FACES is here to support you...every step of the way!       5) THE RNS SYSTEM      The Department of Neurosurgery, the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Medical Center, Drs. Eric Geller, Orrin Devinsky and Werner Doyle are thrilled to announce a long anticipated surgical approach to the management of treatment resistant epilepsy.     On November 14, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the NeuroPace RNS System to treat Medically Refractory Epilepsy, or partial onset seizures that have not been controlled with two or more antiepileptic drugs. This surgical therapy is different than established epilepsy surgery in that it does not involve any brain resection (removal) and is therefore possibly safer and less invasive for many patients. It is used alongside established surgery and appropriate work up that is individualized for each patient.     The RNS System is a novel technology that provides responsive brain stimulation through an implantable therapeutic device that delivers responsive neuro-stimulation, an advanced technology designed to detect abnormal electrical activity in the brain and respond by delivering imperceptible levels of electrical stimulation to normalize brain activity before an individual experiences seizures. In clinical trials performed by Dr. Werner Doyle (Neurosurgeon) and Dr. Eric Geller (Epileptologist), 55% of patients experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizures two years post implantation. One patient obtained full control of seizures that impair consciousness and is now driving for the first time in his life, on less medication. It has been conservatively estimated that over 400,000 patients in the United States alone could benefit from this exciting new technology.

United States. The 2013 meeting was attended by over 5,000 people, and provided a platform for epileptologists, neurosurgeons, basic epilepsy researchers, and clinicians to share cutting-edge information acquired in their respective subfields. AES is unique in its format, and attendees can choose between symposia and lectures with an audience in the thousands; or posters and workshops where the crowd is more intimate and conducive to discussion. In addition, there are networking and mentoring sessions for junior investigators as well.      ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSES OF ANNUAL AES MEETING IS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN BASIC AND CLINICAL EPILEPSY RESEARCH      BELOW ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 2013 MEETING:      NEUROCIRCUITRY OF LENNOX-GASTAUT SYNDROME (LGS) &ndash; Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a type of catastrophic epilepsy that manifests in children less than 4 years of age. There is no cure for it, and complete recovery is very unusual. Children with this can also exhibit intellectual disability and developmental delay. At the AES meeting, researchers discussed the neurocircuitry involved in LGS, along with new advances in neuroimaging to localize the parts of the brain involved in seizure generation.      CATAMENIAL EPILEPSY &ndash; (seizure exacerbation in women with epilepsy that aligns with their menstrual cycle) is a well-recognized phenomenon in the clinic. Recent knowledge about how the brain changes during the menstrual cycle, and the possible reasons why there is a reduced seizure threshold on certain days of the cycle were discussed.      LIMITATIONS TO ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CARE &ndash; epilepsy professionals talked about barriers to care for people with epilepsy. Factors such as shortage of professionals skilled in epilepsy, proper identification of comorbidites and cultural barriers, and the ways to overcome these barriers were discussed.      TUMORS IN PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY &ndash; astrocytic tumors like glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are routinely associated with seizures. At the meeting, evaluation and follow-up for such seizures, prognosis and the cognitive impact of tumor-associated seizures were discussed.      POST-TRAUMATIC EPILEPSY &ndash; Penetrating head injuries can lead to post-traumatic epilepsy and subjects can develop epilepsy months or years after the initial injury. At a special interest group at the AES meeting, the role of anti-seizure drugs as prophylactics, the value of EEG to recognize people who have a higher likelihood of developing epilepsy, and the process of epileptogenesis in people who have undergone post-traumatic injury were discussed.      FUTURE THERAPIES FOR EPILEPSY &ndash; researchers talked about anti-inflammatory therapy, focal cooling, optogenetics and devices for seizure prediction and control.      Dr. Jacqueline French, who was the President of the AES for 2013, gave a lecture titled Changing Landscape of Epilepsy Surgery. She also spoke about Q-PULSE (Quantitative Practical Use Driven Learning Survey in Epilepsy) &ndash; a questionnaire that was given to more than 200 epileptologists, to take the &lsquo;pulse&rsquo; of the epilepsy \ufffccommunity. Using the Q-PULSE system, it was observed that the rate of temporal lobectomy (a surgical procedure for intractable epilepsies) had decreased over the decades. Possible ways to improve the situation and provide better care to people with intractable epilepsy are better patient education and outreach to poorer communities, educating neurologists about epilepsy surgery and facilitating better communication between epilepsy centers.     Helen Scharfman, PhD, who has an appointment at NYU Langone Medical Center and the Nathan Kline Institute, serves on the board of the AES. At the meeting, she moderated a session where epilepsy researchers talked about their involvement with clinical drug discovery. Scientists talked about the process as being long and arduous but ultimately fulfilling. Dr. Scharfman also talked about research in her lab on the role of postnatal neurogenesis (birth of new neurons in adulthood), and how aberrant postnatal neurogenesis can underlie cognitive and behavioral deficiencies in people with epilepsy.      Sloka S. Iyengar, PhD is an epilepsy researcher, and is interested in the basic mechanisms that can cause groups of neurons to generate and sustain seizures. After a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in pharmacy in Ahmedabad, India, Sloka attended University of South Carolina School of Medicine for her graduate work, where under the mentorship of Dr. David Mott, she used electrophysiology to study epileptic circuits in experimental rats. She is now at the Nathan Kline Institute, New York, where she is examining how postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampus can affect seizures and epilepsy in the lab of Dr. Helen Scharfman. In addition to epilepsy research, she also has a strong interest in epilepsy advocacy and education.       7) WERNER DOYLE, MD GIVES A TED TALK     Watch neurosurgeon Dr. Werner Doyle discuss what he&#39;s learned by treating patients who have epilepsy that doesn&#39;t respond to treatment at TEDx Lower East Side.

They do this in honor of my son Eric who suffers from epilepsy and is a patient of Dr. Orrin Devinsky. This year they had a lot of extra help from friends Kristian Thame (15) and Julia Levine (14).The kids marketed, made and packaged the fudge which was sold for $10 per piece. They offered the flavors of heath, chocolate, marshmallow, mint, almond and butterscotch. Each piece was beautifully wrapped in purple tissue and ribbon. A thank you note was attached with the tag line &quot;Fudge makes FACES smile&quot;.     I am incredibly proud of the kids and all their hard work. They plan to continue making fudge for FACES! $2,700 worth of fudge was sold and along with a 2K matching donation sent from my husband&rsquo;s employer, a grand total of $4,700 was donated to FACES.          9) FACES APARTMENTS 2013 STATISTICS      The FACES Apartments program is provided &ldquo;cost-free&rdquo; to families who travel from far away to receive epilepsy treatment at NYU Langone Medical Center. Year round, two standard rooms are available for occupancy at the Affinia Shelburne Hotel located on 37th Street and Lexington Avenue. This hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to NYULMC. Requests for accommodations are awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis. Priority is based on financial necessity and medical severity. Furthermore, only 1 room per family is granted. In case there is no availability, families will be referred to the NYU Hospitality Hotline at 212-263-2092, where families may be able to secure hotel accommodations at a discounted rate.     In 2013, FACES was able to serve:        69 families total      Families came from 21 states and 4 different countries      Length of stay ranged from 1 day to 6 weeks      A total of 564 room nights were provided        If you would like to inquire about a FACES Apartment, please email facesapartments@nyumc.org . Your message will be returned within 48 hours.       10) NEW AT FACES: THE FACES PET RELATIONSHIP PROJECT     At FACES we continue to work together to make a difference and improve the quality of life for all of those affected by epilepsy and seizures. As professionals dedicated to comprehensive holistic treatment protocols, we recognize that families with pets share a special relationship that also provides another healing treatment tool when struggling with catastrophic illness.     Based on discussions with Amie&rsquo;s Place Foundation, who funds organizations that create programs dedicated to keeping families and pets together, we designed a questionnaire to determine whether pet relationships are important to our families who are presently being treated for epilepsy or seizure disorder. 78% said that when they receive treatment, having their pet close by brings them great comfort. 50% of those questioned said that they live in the tri-state area and it would be helpful for them to have some pet- care assistance when caring for an ill family member.     FACES shared these valuable findings with Amie&rsquo;s Place and is pleased to announce that the Foundation has awarded FACES with a $103,814 one-year grant to support the FACES Pet Relationship Project (PRP). A growing body of scientific research suggests that pets can have a positive healing impact on our health and quality of life. This study will examine a trial of children and/or adults with treatment resistant epilepsy and see how they respond to treatment while developing a pet relationship. A trial of 20 children and/or adults with treatment resistant epilepsy will decide on a pet of their choice.     The patient/family will complete an application explaining why they want a pet and why they want to participate in this program. For the first 2 months, they will be randomized to receive a pet or not to receive a pet. (FACES will work with the ASPCA and the Humane Society to assist patients with pet adoption). Investigators will measure quality of life and mood ratings of all patients. After 2 months have passed, all patients receive the pet of their choice and will continue to be monitored for an additional 2 months. Medications will remain stable. The primary purpose would be to determine if those with treatment resistant epilepsy experience additional health benefits from their pet relationships. We will collect data on all individuals every 2 months and perform a systematic interview to assess the impact of the pet on their lives.     FACES is looking to determine if those with epilepsy or seizure disorder experience additional healthy benefits from their relationship with a pet. Consistent with our goal to improve the quality of life for people with epilepsy, FACES seeks to identify and provide another healing treatment tool by promoting the animal-human bond.     This &ldquo;first-of-its-kind&rdquo;, FACES Pet Relationship Project (PRP) is in honor and recognition of John Gianutsos. Dr. Orrin Devinsky, Director, NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center states,&quot; John was a spectacular researcher, colleague, and inspirational friend. His pioneering work continues to improve the lives of many patients with neurological disorders.&quot; The relationship he shared with Dr. Devinsky reflects how deeply meaningful relationships, such as the human-animal bond, impact each other.     Additionally, Amie&rsquo;s Place Foundation has allocated to FACES twenty-five (25) free six-year sponsored memberships, totaling $6,250 from its grant to MedicAlert Foundation International, &ldquo;Keeping Families Connected Free Memberships Program for qualified pet owners&rdquo;. This will provide FACES epilepsy and seizure disorder patients - who are also pet owners - with 24/7 emergency services and medical ID&rsquo;s which will ensure that their pets are taken care of should they face a crisis.       11) THE FACES PET RELATIONSHIP PROJECT -- KEEPING FAMILIES CONNECTED     To access a copy of The MedicAlert Foundation, &ldquo;Keeping Families Connected Free Memberships Program&rdquo; brochure and enrollment form for FACES epilepsy and seizure disorder Medicaid patients - who are also pet owners - PLEASE CLICK HERE .

Neural recordings from patients performing sensory-motor tasks involving speech production show that sensory-motor transformations occur bilaterally. Electrodes with significant activity in response to three types of task are shown: (i) sensory-motor (red), (ii) production (blue), and (iii) auditory (green). Auditory and sensory-motor activations (red with green) were often present on the same electrode. Sensory-motor activity was observed bilaterally (ie. in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain). Reproduced from Cogan et al, Nature, 2014.       The NYU ECoG Group website was recently launched to highlight the research efforts of this consortium. The Group is based within the NYU Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (Director: Dr. Orrin Devinsky) and led by Thomas Thesen, Ph.D. It is comprised of numerous researchers and clinicians from NYU (and collaborators from the University of California, San Diego, Harvard University, Princeton University and Columbia University) who are using intracranialrecordings to provide fundamental insights into human brain function.     Electrocorticography (ECoG), or intracranial EEG (iEEG), is the practice of using intracranial electrodes to record electrical activity from the brain. These electrodes are placed directly on the surface of the brain or within deeper brain regions during clinical procedures. For instance, as part of their evaluation for epilepsy surgery, some epilepsy patients undergo monitoring with intracranial electrodes to localize the region(s) of the brain where seizures originate. In addition to improving the ability to surgically treat epilepsy, ECoG recordings provide unique opportunities to examine the underlying mechanisms and brain networks involved in many important cognitive functions.     &ldquo;Recordings directly from the human brain are a rare opportunity,&rdquo; says Dr. Thomas Thesen, Director of the NYU ECoG Group and Assistant Professor of Neurology &amp; Radiology at NYU School of Medicine. &ldquo;As such, they offer unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution over other imaging technologies to help us achieve a better understanding of complex and uniquely human brain functions, such as language&rdquo;.     Since the inception of the NYU ECoG Group in 2007, more than 10 research papers &ndash; involving data collected from a large number of epilepsy patients &ndash; have been published. These studies have led to several important insights about the workings of the human brain. The latest paper from the group was published this month in Nature. This study analyzed brain activity as patients engaged in speech tasks. The findings showed that speech processing requires both sides of the brain.     &ldquo;Our findings upend what has been universally accepted in the scientific community &ndash; that we use only one side of our brains for speech&rdquo; says Dr. Bijan Pesaran, an Associate Professor in the Center for Neural Science at NYU and the study&rsquo;s senior author. &ldquo;Now that we have greater insights into the connection between the brain and speech, we can begin to develop new ways to aid those trying to regain the ability to speak after a stroke or injuries resulting in brain damage&rdquo;.     Research studies involving ECoG recordings at NYU would not be possible without the support of funding agencies (National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense) and foundations (FACES), as well as the generous participation of patients.

If so, please contact Ms. Robin Dunn Fixell at rdunnfixell@yahoo.com for more information.     1) A Letter from Brooke Stein      Dear Dr. Devinsky, Dr. Weiner and Erin,     The proud mama in me has to share some great news about Liam with you because each of you was vital in making last night happen.     Liam, a freshman, wrestled in his first varsity match last night. Constant seizures in middle school prevented him from wrestling in a match outside of practice. His high school coach told us that Liam earned his varsity spot this week through incredibly hard work.     Although he lost his match by one point, it was a huge victory for my son. When he finished his match, his coaches, teammates and all of the parents were in tears because, after having been on this journey with us, they knew what last night meant to Liam. Thank you for being the very best at what you do. Because of you, Liam is doing amazingly well.     With gratitude,   Brooke Stein     2) A Letter from Paul Casey     Eager to share the story of his decades-long struggle with epilepsy, Paul J. Casey, a husband and father of two who works as in non-profit leadership, recently sent us an inspiring story that offers hope to others. On December 14, 2013, he celebrated the two year anniversary of the brain surgery that changed his life. In the interest of space, we have summarized much of his letter and included many of his own statements.      Seize the Day!      Paul: The seizures that I had throughout my childhood were physically, academically and mentally challenging...the medicine that I needed to take created additional quality of life issues. As a child with epilepsy, I thought, &quot;Why me?&quot;     Before doctors realized that side effects from his medications were to blame, Paul found he was unable to control his emotions--especially his anger--and fighting and an inability to focus on schoolwork made life difficult in fifth and sixth grades. Despite the challenges he faced as a child with epilepsy, with the help of his family, life did improve throughout middle school and high school. As a young adult taking a cocktail of medications, Paul attended college, got his driver&#39;s license and began experiencing seizures only during his sleep. But nighttime seizures also brought panic attacks; in Colorado, as an AmeriCorps volunteer, the fear of being on his own was heightened when neighbors and EMS had to break down his door to come to his aid.      Paul: Returning to New York gave me the security of living with family and alleviated some of the fear of being alone....Because of the stress of unemployment, I was having more seizures; and I didn&#39;t have health insurance or money for my medications.     Thanks to enrolling in a study at Cornell Medical Center, Paul received treatment at no cost, and eventually was able to return to work, marry, become a homeowner and start a family. In his 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s, Paul dealt with such issues as lack of sleep, weight gain and fatigue--all caused by the huge doses of medication he needed to function. It wasn&#39;t until the birth of his second child, Evan, and a diagnosis of his son&#39;s kidney disease, that Paul decided to become more proactive in his own health care; he wanted to be around for Evan and to be a candidate for a kidney transplant should his son need one someday.      Paul: Evan&#39;s health condition helped me realize that...seizure activity increased dramatically when under stress....In 2010, I began to see a new epileptologist at University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey....The doctor explained the damage these seizures could have on the rest of my body--including my heart; if I was having seizures, being a kidney donor would be very unlikely. I realized that having seizures and dealing with medication was not just about Paul; it was about my family and all those I was important to.     At the age of 38, Paul learned from the results of an MRI that the dysplasia located in this right temporal lobe could be removed with minimal risk or side effects.      Paul: This was amazing news. As I drove away from the hospital that day, I remember thinking that this could be the biggest decision I ever make....I was determined to do whatever I could to make sure I could be there for my family.     After researching the possibilities, it was decided that Paul would put himself in the hands of Dr. Eric Geller and his team at Saint Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey. He then met NYU&#39;s Dr. Werner Doyle through NYU&#39;s partnership with Saint Barnabas.      Paul: Dr. Doyle met with my wife Ann, my mother and I to go over the process and the different phases of surgery....The kindness that he showed could have been as important as the skill he utilized in surgery!...I left that day feeling in awe that I could be so fortunate to have a doctor who was not just the best at what he does, but was also an amazing person!     Paul was scheduled for the first phase of a two-part surgery on December 7, 2011; his second surgery would take place on December 14, 2011. The risks? His seizures would not be eradicated (although they would not likely get worse), and that his hearing might be affected. Possible rewards? Experiencing better sleep; feeling more energetic; being seizure-free; and forgoing medication. In addition, he would be able to give Evan a kidney, should he ever need it. The surgery on December 14th went smoothly and was considered a great success! Afterward, Paul experienced significant pain, which was managed with medication, and he also experienced a bout of depression that, with the help of a supportive family and anti-depressants, finally lifted three weeks later. On January 10, 2012, Paul ventured out of the house for the first time. He was back to work full time in the beginning of February.      Paul: Now, two years later, I look back at this experience and I am so pleased to see that the reward of this surgery was so much greater than I could have realized. Physically, there were no side effects....My energy level is much higher; I am sleeping much better and am completely seizure free!....My outlook on risk, seizing the opportunity and my ability to deal with stress and adversity has made me a better father, husband and human services professional....I now play the role of the person that others can rely on as they look to overcome challenges.     Looking back on how epilepsy shaped his life, Paul no longer asks, &quot;Why me?&quot;      Paul: I have been blessed with a wonderful and supportive wife, amazing kids, great family and fantastic friends. This fortune, my renewed energy and good health, along with what I have learned through my life experiences afford me the daily opportunity to help others learn from their experiences and improve life for everyone. Seize the day, take the exciting opportunity and help make it a better life for everyone.     3) A letter from Michelle Sanders on her Daughter: Olivia&rsquo;s Ketogenic Diet Success     Olivia, are you okay? Olivia, do you remember where you were going? Olivia, can you wake up?      The signs were there for months--unusual incidents of blank stares, disorientation and morning exhaustion. Later, we learned that the children at school were familiar with Olivia&#39;s facial drooping and excessive drooling. Olivia dismissively reported seizures that had occurred daily, but at the time she didn&rsquo;t have a name for them and they disappeared quickly.So that morning, when Olivia slumped on the reading rug and began twitching head to toe while drooling, no one seemed afraid. Her friend simply called out, &ldquo;Olivia is doing that thing again, but this time she is not getting up.&rdquo;     Maybe that&#39;s why our eight-year-old Olivia so casually described her symptoms in the emergency room that Tuesday in April, to the caring and calm Dr. Rina Goldberg&ndash;who then proceeded to explain Benign Rolandic Epilepsy and EEG&#39;s, and why an MRI was needed to rule out other possibilities. Within hours, Olivia was hooked up and showing centrotemporal spikes that looked like crayons gone wild. In the blink of an eye, we leapt into the whole new world of epilepsy, Olivia handling everything in stride with her usual charm and joy. Since this diagnosis is commonly outgrown and easily controlled with medication, Olivia would surely return to school in a few days and this would be behind us.      Unfortunately, as the months passed, our second-grade shock grew into third-grade frustration, while we watched our vivacious Olivia fade behind a fog of blank stares. She also experienced distorted facial appearances, learning struggles, difficulty controlling hunger and emotional meltdowns. With the help of our doctors--and iterations of medications--as well as websites and strong school support, we desperately tried to pull our Olivia back to us. Failing the fourth grade was not an option. Medications were working to calm many of Olivia&rsquo;s more aggressive seizures, but they carried unacceptable side effects. After much research, we found compelling information on dietary regimens that could be helpful to the brain. We looked at the Perfect Health Diet, the Paleo Diet and the Atkins Diet. Under the cautious guidance of Dr. Orrin Devinsky, we chose a therapeutic diet--the ketogenic diet-- specific to childhood epilepsy, but not typically used for Olivia&rsquo;s type of diagnosis.     At NYU, we started the diet, and we experienced not just one, but all of the possible difficulties of ketosis. We knew the struggles ahead, but we were determined for this to work. Olivia wanted to feel better and was on board!     After the hospital stay, we entered the detailed phase of weighing and measuring, and living a grain-and sugar-free lifestyle, which required a great deal of daily planning and preparation. We used the Charlie Foundation guide, the Keto Cookbook and customized recipes recommended by Dr. Devinsky&rsquo;s dietician, Courtney Glick. To manage Olivia&rsquo;s fat and protein ratios, we filled containers with 150-calorie snacks and 500-calorie meals. We tested her blood glucose and ketones morning and afternoon--relying on a magic combination of fats from MCT oil and organic heavy cream. For more palatable menu choices, we removed the fat from the recipes and found it easier to have Olivia swig the MCT oil and heavy cream like a dose of medicine. As a family, we now avoid foods that contain chemicals, natural flavorings, citric acid and spices that have dextrose. Over time, when you make up your mind to do anything, you find the necessary patience and resources. We all feel better and we have learned to love new foods like lettuce wraps, olives, almond butter and coconut flour.      Nothing has been easy, but all of it has been worth the results. Olivia is back! Miraculously, in addition to feeling emotionally stable, she has seen her stamina and desired weight return, and she has regained her math and reading skills. If you didn&#39;t know Olivia&#39;s history, you would never suspect a problem. From one month to the next, we have titrated down her medication while increasing her favorite activities; in fact, in February, Olivia will sing a duet with a dear friend in her upcoming fifth-grade school musical.     We owe a debt of gratitude to our amazing Olivia, who is an incredibly spirited young girl. Without her courage and commitment, success would never have been a reality. Our wonderful family and friends have supported and encouraged our efforts; and through this all, we found our way because of the determination of our doctors, nurses and many dedicated Deerfield Elementary School teachers and administrators. Epilepsy may not be gone, but we are back on track in finding a more manageable way to live seizure-free.       14) FACES NOTEWORTHY PRESS     Top 10 National Press Articles         Epilepsy Patients Help Decode The Brain&rsquo;s Hidden Signals       Dr. French and Dr. Devinsky named Top U.S. Specialists in Epilepsy       Our Research with Intracranial Implant Patients has Made the National News       Families with Sick Children Flock to Colorado to Try Cannabis Treatments       &#39;Miracle&#39; Diet Stops Woodthorpe Boy&#39;s Epileptic Fits       Dr. Kothare (Pediatric Sleep Program) Talks About Sleep &amp; Engineer at the Controls of the Train that Derailed in NY (2nd half of video)       Parents of Children with Epilepsy Lobby Lawmakers Over Medical Marijuana       New York&#39;s Medical Marijuana Law Excludes Some Who Seek the Drug       Studies Highlight Benefits and Risks of Ketogenic Diet for Refractory Epilepsy       Florida Bill Would Allow Marijuana Extract For Child Seizures               FACES NEEDS YOUR HELP     With the help of our fantastic FACES community, the 2013 FACES Gala Auction was the most successful to date with over 350 packages!
