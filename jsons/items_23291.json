Find the heading for your departure point (make sure you have the correct timetable, direction and time of travel).   Look down the column under your departure heading to find the time you will need to be at the bus stop.   Locate the heading for your destination.   Read across from your departure time to determine your arrival time.   If you need to transfer, follow the same steps for the second route. (Your destination point on the first route will be your departure point on the second route).   If you want to reach a destination by a specific time, it may be easier to work backwards. In other words, find the arrival time you want for your destination first; then reverse the process to find the time you should be at the first stop to begin your trip.

Its heart is in Greenwich Village around Washington Square Park, but with institutes and centers on the Upper East Side, academic buildings and dorms down on Wall Street, and NYU-Poly in downtown Brooklyn, getting from place to place at NYU requires a little assistance.        Luckily, there are a lot of options available to get around New York City. University Transportation services run between the Washington Square campus and NYU residence halls.   The MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) runs the subway, train and bus systems that will get you where you need to go.   If all else fails and you're in the Village, head over to Broadway to catch a cab downtown (yellow cabs only, please) or over to Sixth Avenue to catch one going uptown.

Find the heading for your departure point (make sure you have the correct timetable, direction and time of travel).   Look down the column under your departure heading to find the time you will need to be at the bus stop.   Locate the heading for your destination.   Read across from your departure time to determine your arrival time.   If you need to transfer, follow the same steps for the second route. (Your destination point on the first route will be your departure point on the second route).   If you want to reach a destination by a specific time, it may be easier to work backwards. In other words, find the arrival time you want for your destination first; then reverse the process to find the time you should be at the first stop to begin your trip.

Please plan your trip accordingly and allow for sufficient time when riding Campus Transportation Services vehicles. Your patience is appreciated when delays occur, and Campus Transportation Services apologizes for any such delays that you may encounter.

Its heart is in Greenwich Village around Washington Square Park, but with institutes and centers on the Upper East Side, academic buildings and dorms down on Wall Street, and NYU-Poly in downtown Brooklyn, getting from place to place at NYU requires a little assistance.        Luckily, there are a lot of options available to get around New York City. University Transportation services run between the Washington Square campus and NYU residence halls.   The MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) runs the subway, train and bus systems that will get you where you need to go.   If all else fails and you're in the Village, head over to Broadway to catch a cab downtown (yellow cabs only, please) or over to Sixth Avenue to catch one going uptown.
