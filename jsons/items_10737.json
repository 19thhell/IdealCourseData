The arts of live performance have shaped the civic, religious, and ideological lives of human beings throughout history. In the globalized present, their capacity for shaping events and encounters between actual individuals in real space and time gives them unique opportunities for creating understanding and exchange between and beyond traditions. Students majoring in Theater at NYU Abu Dhabi explore these opportunities through rigorous academic study of world dramatic literature, theater history, and performance traditions as well as by training and experimenting in the collaborative techniques of theatrical expression, not only acting and writing but also costume, stage, and lighting design. The program balances a high regard for performance traditions with a deep commitment to experimentation, risk taking, and invention.   Today, theater-making happens at the multiple intersections of individual stories, world literature, global culture, changing technology, and interdisciplinary theory. By thinking critically about the past, present, and future of artistic and cultural performance, and by studying the cultural rituals, personal expressions, public roles, and political perspectives that make up the canon of world performance, students learn to locate their own relationship to performance \u2014 be it scholarly, artistic, or a combination of the two \u2014 in an intellectually fertile and challenging environment.   As an intensely collaborative and inherently local art form, the theater offers a way of creating community. As students come together to work cooperatively on topics of shared interest, they develop interpersonal skills and social values that are perhaps more important today, in our often impersonal world, than ever before. Discipline, teamwork, communication, creative expression, and collective problem-solving: these skills transform the lives of individuals and lay the foundations for successful careers not only in the performing arts but in many other fields as well, such as advertising, arts administration, broadcasting, education, law, management, politics, or social work.   The Theater program at NYUAD welcomes majors and non-majors to join us in creating a lively performance program for the college community, with events ranging from full productions to informal readings, solo performances, student-directed plays, and site-specific events on campus and beyond.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project.

In this course students design sound for ongoing theatrical productions, films by NYUAD students, or installation work, and learn how to approach sound design for these diverse media. Topics such as Automatic Dialog Replacement (ADR), Foley, post-synchronized sound and musique concr&egrave;te techniques are covered, and several examples of sound design for film and theatrical performance are analyzed and discussed in class, leading the students to develop their own conceptual approaches to sound design.    * Prerequiste: MUSIC-AD 106 and MUSIC-AD 120 or equivalent.

Acting and performance are central to the process, but so is the recognition that a performance takes place in a space that has to be invested with rules and conventions before it can tell a story. Exploring the possibilities offered by these rules and conventions is key to understanding the potential for theater as a means of expression and mode of knowledge. Combining the tools and techniques of Aristotle, Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Brecht, Grotowski, Brook, and Bogart, students work in groups to devise and stage silent stories as well as textual scenes to explore what it means to create a theatrical experience. All students participate as directors, actors, designers, and audience, and discuss each other&rsquo;s work in order to develop a clearer and more objective relationship to their own.

The course introduces key terms and methodologies for understanding performance as an object of analysis and a means of expressive behavior. We explore how particular theories of drama emerge at historical moments and why; we do so by looking at those theories embodiment on the stage, in dramatic literature, in public, and in everyday life. The aim of this class is to provide a performance vocabulary that will serve as a foundation and framework for advanced studies. Although this is not a survey of theatre history, the course will draw from a wide variety of historical plays and performances to elucidate the critical concerns of the field.

We engage the body as an expressive tool in support of artistic craft and technique and build confidence in our ability to translate creative impulses through physical action. The course guides the student through awareness of and release from habitual tensions and into body alignment, breathing, resonators, sound and movement, group interaction, and the exploration of individual and group creativity. We focus on the kinetic application of movement in the art-making process, using core energy, dynamics, breath connection, strength, flexibility, range of motion, stamina, and relaxation techniques in order to strengthen our creative output. The goal is a free voice in a free body and the ability to express thought and emotion with openness and truth.

Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

THEAT-AD 151 Dramas from the African Continent and the African Diaspora                                                                              In this course, we critique 20th- and 21st century plays from the African continent, including works from Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Ethiopia, and South Africa (the Sub-Saharan countries) as well as from Tunis, Algeria, Egypt, Libya Morocco, and Tunisia (North African countries). From a variety of critical theoretical discourses, our discussions focus on the theatrical practices demanded by the texts, along with the intersections and divergences of structures and topics shared by continental plays, such as blackness and race, exile, colonialism and post-colonialism, violence, gender inequality, family, moral and social values, interraciality, religion, and political resistance. The plays from North Africa that align with the Arab world will serve as a bridge to introduce noteworthy works from the African diaspora, with plays written by Africans or those of African ancestry living in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.

THEAT-AD 152 Art, Performance, and Social Practice                                                        How do we begin to know each other differently from the way in which dominant social systems and communicative technologies structure our daily interactions? This question drives art and performance&rsquo;s &ldquo;social turn&rdquo; to real-world collaborations between artists and performers who act in the role of instigators or catalysts with the communities around them. The social turn explicitly rejects the artist&rsquo;s more traditional role as the producer of a consumable aesthetic object or theatrical performance and instead proposes that the conscious processes of collaborative engagement -- activist, participatory, coauthored &ndash; must be understood and valued as art. In this intertwining of art with performance, cooperative processes are foregrounded as frameworks to understand and shift the impact of political and social policy, architecture, art history, urban planning, and new media on our lives. The social practice of art proposes that in making encounters where artists engage with the members of communities as &ldquo;expert participants,&rdquo; we might construct more livable alternatives through social cooperation. Art as social practice also insists that this process is an aesthetic practice. In this course we will read recent critical theories and histories of the aesthetics and politics of the social practice of art, explore case studies of &ldquo;relational art,&rdquo; and collaborate on our own &ldquo;living as form&rdquo; project.

THEAT-AD 153 African Women Playwrights                                                        African Women Playwrights&rdquo; is a reading intensive course that focuses on the structurally and narratively diversified theatrical texts written by women from the continent in the 20th and 21st century. We&rsquo;ll critique the plays as both literature and dramatic texts intended for production. What is clearly evident in African women playwrights&rsquo; writing is its focus on women&rsquo;s agency; generational legacies; tradition, colonialism, and modernism; tribal and national identities; family relationships; intimacy and commitment; the spirit world of rituals, polytheism, and monotheism; the challenging coexistence between Christianity and Islam; the impact of the global diaspora on African identity; and the intersecting issues of blackness, Africanness, and womanhood. The course will address these various foci through the works of Andiah Kisia (Kenya), Nathalie Etoke, Werewere Liking (Cameroon), Tsitsi Dangarembga (Zimbabwe), Fatima Gallaire (Algeria), Penina Mlama, Amadina Lihamba (Tanzania), Ama Ata Aidoo, Efua Sutherland (Ghana), Osonye Tess Onwueme, Zulu Sofola, Julie Okoh (Nigeria), Sindiwe Magona, Malika Ndlovu, Gcina Mhlope (South Africa), Violet Barungi, and Deborah Asiimwe (Uganda). The foundational critical theories for the course are postcolonialism, feminism, critical race theory, and diasporic studies. We will also engage the new plays by African women that are produced at the 2nd Annual Kampala International Theatre Festival (Nov 25-29, 2015) through the assistance of award-winning Ugandan playwright, Deborah Asiimwe, who is co-director of this East African theatre festival (as well as the representative for the Sundance Institute East Africa).

Training exercises are used to develop kinesthetic awareness, focus, listening, character, action, creativity, imagination, and collaboration. Through a holistic approach connected to recent findings in cognitive science, students build technical craft as well as begin to remove obstructive physical, vocal and mental habits, so as to release the full potential of the responsiveness, expressivity, and presence of their actor/performer instruments: the body-mind.    *Prerequisites are: THEAT-AD 110 Fundamentals of Acting OR THEAT-AD 111 Body at Work: Voice and Movement for the Artist    Students in the NYUNY Drama Dept: This course counts as an elective credit towards the major .

Concentration in Theater     The concentration in Theater is open to all NYUAD students and offers the opportunity to explore the history, theory, and practice of theater and performance. The study of this ancient, universal, and multifaceted art form illuminates the power of the imagination in engaging with and shaping the political and spiritual lives of individuals and cultures. The concentration in Theater is designed to be combined with a major in another discipline and to develop the student\u2019s capacity for intellectual and creative risk-taking in the pursuit of knowledge. The expressive and interpretive skills developed in working with dramatic material make the concentration in Theater an excellent component of a well-rounded liberal arts education. All courses that a student wishes to count towards the concentration in Theater must be approved in advance by the student's mentor, including those taken at NYU's global sites. Only one course may double-count for the concentration in Theater and another major or concentration.

Death of a Salesman   In the Fall of 2011, Professor Rub\u00e9n Polendo and his theater troupe Theater Mitu staged a student performance of the classic Death of a Salesman.                                                                               I want to be a scientist, but I don\u2019t think of science as an isolated subject. It\u2019s interrelated with our daily lives and there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t derive scientific inspiration from literature, the arts, and even athletics.
