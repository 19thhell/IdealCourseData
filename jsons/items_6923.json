Such conflicting projects prompt us to ask: How do we choose to destroy certain places while preserving&mdash;or recreating&mdash;others, and what are the consequences of making these choices? What are the ethical problems we face when we save or demolish historic sites, and how are they tied to questions of individual, community, and national identity? These questions derive from political discourse that imagines how nationhood is created and sustained, as well as historical and anthropological inquiry, which so often attempt to locate the \"truth\" of the past and the meaning of place.
