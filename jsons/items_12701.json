A written proposal must be submitted to and approved by the instructor, then submitted to the Office of Academic Services before a student may register. The written proposal ordinarily is at least two pages double-spaced (or at least 1,000 words) and should describe the subject matter of the Directed Research and the issues the student intends to explore in the paper. The student may register by using an add/drop form that Academic Services will supply upon receipt of the signed proposal within the stated deadlines. Directed research credits may be added through September 30 for Fall 2014 and February 10 for Spring 2015 . The usual allocation is two credits. A student may write a one-credit Directed Research but it will not suffice for the Substantial Writing requirement satisfaction . A three-credit Directed Research project is highly unusual and requires the approval of the Vice Dean. Students considering this should contact Academic Services. Also note that requests to late add Directed Research will only be considered if your credit load (not including the Directed Research credits) does not drop below the minimum 12 credits at any point in the semester after the add/drop period. Students who are granted permission to late add Directed Research will not be permitted to drop classes if the result is inconsistent with the above, so please plan your schedule accordingly.   You may ask any full-time faculty member or visiting faculty member to supervise Directed Research. Adjunct professors may supervise Directed Research only with permission of the Vice Dean. A two-credit Directed Research may satisfy the Substantial Writing requirement. Failure to make academic progress on a Directed Research may result in a student\u2019s withdrawal with a grade of \u201cWD.\u201d   After March 15 of the student\u2019s final semester , no faculty member may accept a request from a student to perform directed research or other work for law school credit unless the student has first received the approval of the Vice Dean. The Vice Dean may allow such work if the student needs the credit for May graduation and July bar certification subject to the following:     No more than two (2) credits can be earned in this manner.   In making his or her decision, the Vice Dean shall consider (a) the date of the student\u2019s request; (b) the nature of the proposal; and (c) whether the missing credits or the timing of the student\u2019s request are the result of circumstances that were within the student\u2019s ability to avoid. Failure of the student to properly calculate his or her credits at an earlier time, failure in a course, and removal from a course for excessive absences are examples of circumstances within the student\u2019s control to avoid.   If the missing credits result from circumstances outside the student\u2019s control, the Vice Dean will permit the credit if at all academically reasonable.   If the Vice Dean approves the student\u2019s application, it will be the student\u2019s responsibility to find a faculty member willing to supervise the student\u2019s proposed work and award the credit in a timely manner.

To undertake Directed Research, students must contact individual instructors and agree on a research project. To register, a written proposal must be approved and signed by the instructor, and then submitted to the Office of Graduate Affairs. The written proposal should be at 1000 words and should describe the subject matter of the Directed Research and the issues the student intends to explore in the paper. While any full-time faculty member or visiting faculty member may supervise the research, Adjunct Professors may supervise only with the permission of the Vice Dean.   Normally, two credits are allocated for Directed Research. A two-credit Directed Research project should conform to the same guidelines as the substantial writing requirement for JD Students . For non-tax students no more than four of a student\u2019s 24 credits may consist of directed research. Tax students may take a maximum of two credits of directed research.    Regardless of the type of project involved, students are, of course, expected to submit original, non-duplicative work. When in doubt about proper use of a citation or quotation, discuss the issue with the instructor. Plagiarism is a serious offense that may merit severe discipline. Failure to make academic progress on a Directed Research may result in a student\u2019s withdrawal with a grade of \u201cWD.\u201d    Requests to add Directed Research after the deadline stated above require approval of the Vice Dean. Such requests should be initiated by contacting the Office of Graduate Affairs and will only be considered if your credit load (not including the Directed Research credits) does not drop below the minimum 12 credits at any point in the semester after the add/drop period. Students who are granted permission to late-add Directed Research will not be permitted to drop courses if the result is inconsistent with the above; please plan your schedule accordingly.    After March 15, the Vice Dean may allow a student to add Directed Research only in exceptional circumstances. No more than two credits can be earned in this manner.   In considering the request, the Vice Dean will take into account the totality of the circumstances including: (a) the date of the request; (b) the nature of the proposal; and (c) whether the missing credits or the timing of the student\u2019s request are the result of circumstances that were within the student\u2019s ability to control. If the Vice Dean approves the student\u2019s application, it will be the student\u2019s responsibility to find a faculty member willing to supervise the proposed work and award credit in a timely manner.   Directed Research During the Summer Semester   Students may register for Directed Research during the summer semester. The summer registration deadlines is July 1, unless there is approval by the Vice Dean to add at a later date. Please note that full-time students will be charged per credit for Directed Research during the summer. All work must be submitted by September 1 or by an earlier deadline established by the supervising faculty member.   Writing Credit   In seminars, colloquia, and courses that offer the option to add an additional writing credit, students may earn one credit for writing a substantial paper (at least 10,000 words in length exclusive of footnotes). To earn the additional credit, students must register for the writing credit section of the course within the same semester the course is offered. The deadline for registering is September 30, 2014 for Fall 2014, and February 10, 2015, for Spring 2015.   LLM Thesis Option   LLM students have the option to write a substantial research paper, in conjunction with a seminar or Directed Research that may be recorded as a \"thesis\" on their transcript. At the onset of the seminar or Directed Research, the student must obtain approval from the professor that the paper will be completed for a \"thesis\" designation.   It should be substantial in length (at least 10,000 words exclusive of footnotes) and, like the substantial writing requirement for JD students, must be analytical rather than descriptive in nature, showing original thought and analysis. Please note the thesis designation is for a single research paper agreed upon in advance.   The student is required to submit an outline and at least one FULL PRE-FINAL draft to the faculty member in order to receive the thesis notation. When submitting a final draft of the thesis to the faculty member, the student must give the faculty member an LLM Thesis Certification form . The faculty member is required to return the signed form to the Office of Graduate Affairs when submitting a grade for the course.   Please note that the student will not receive additional credit for writing the thesis, but will only receive credit for the seminar or Directed Research for which he or she is registered.   International Legal Studies Students should review their program requirements for further information about writing an LLM thesis within their program.
