CEP classes meet Monday through Thursday for about five hours of class each day.   At the beginning levels (Intro\u20132), all classes are taught as integrated language skills classes designed to provide a comprehensive English learning experience.   At the intermediate levels (3\u20136), instruction consists of two morning comprehensive core classes and two afternoon English enrichment and engagement classes. Both core courses integrate all English skills. At these levels, students select two types of afternoon enrichment and engagement classes. One offers focused practice on a specific language or academic skill, such as pronunciation, vocabulary development, and TOEFL prep. The other invites students to explore a topic of interest and to develop their linguistic and cultural fluency and confidence through engaging in the real use of English. Topics include American film, history of New York City, art appreciation and business English.   At advanced levels (7-9), students complete their schedules with ALI electives, ALI advanced evening courses for specific purposes, or NYU School of Professional Studies noncredit classes. This flexibility allows advanced students to fine-tune their course selection to best suit their interests and needs.

What Is a Probationary Period?   The probationary period is the initial period of employment, a kind of \u201ctrial period\u201d, during which the supervisor carefully considers whether the employee is able to meet the standards and expectations of the job and if the employee should be retained by NYU as a \u201cregular\u201d employee (the probationary period does not apply to transfer employees). During this time, the supervisor appraises the employee\u2019s:     Ability to learn and perform job duties   Quality of work   Productivity   Work habits   Cooperation   Attendance   Punctuality   Other standards and expectations specific to the employee\u2019s work situation     If the employee is clearly not meeting the requirements of the job, the employee may be released at any time during the probationary period.   Note: The probationary period is intended to be used to determine whether the right employee has been hired for the job. Once the probationary period ends, the process for releasing an employee generally requires further documentation.   Probationary Periods for Each Group   The probationary period for each group is different:                 Group  Probationary Period  Administrators and Professionals and Professional Research Staff (below level of director or equivalent) Six months from date of hire  Office and Clerical and Laboratory and Technical Staff Three months from date of hire  Service Staff Consult the applicable collective bargaining agreement      Note (for all groups): If a full-time temporary employee becomes a full-time regular employee in the same position for which he or she was originally hired, the time worked as a temporary employee is credited toward the completion of the probationary period.   Extension of Probation   Under special circumstances a probationary period may be extended if the supervisor needs more time to appraise the employee. An extension must be requested at least one week in advance of the end of the probationary period and all extensions need to be approved by the Deputy Director of Talent, Learning and Organizational Development. Additionally, extensions for Office and Clerical or Laboratory and Technical staff positions must also be approved by the Local 3882, the collective bargaining agent for these employees.   Determining If the Employee Passes the Probationary Period   If a supervisor decides to keep the employee on staff beyond the probationary period, he or she must complete a Probationary Review Form and return it to the department\u2019s HR Officer. NYU's Employee Relations Office sends the Human Resources Officer notification several weeks before the end of the probationary period to allow the supervisor enough time to think about the employee\u2019s performance and to schedule a meeting with the employee just prior to the end of the probationary period to discuss performance.   Note: No department should retain an employee beyond the last day of the probationary period unless they have an official extension or they intend for the employee to pass probation.   Once the employee has passed the probationary period, he or she becomes a regular staff member and is eligible for all benefits available for that job classification. For details on employee benefit options, select &quot; Benefits &quot; or email askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .   Documenting Problems or Misconduct   Formal written warnings and other documentation usually are not required during the probationary period. However, serious problems or misconduct may warrant documentation. Consult with your HR Officer for further assistance in these matters.   Terminating an Employee After the Probationary Period   If a supervisor decides to terminate an employee after he or she has passed the probationary period, the supervisor should consult with his or her HR Officer to discuss the relevant performance issues. Since most employees have access to a grievance and arbitration procedure, documentation may be requested for further review. Guidance and assistance regarding termination may also be secured from the Office of Employee Relations at 212-998-1290.   Transfers: The First Three Months   Although there is no official probationary period for an employee who transfers to another position, the supervisor and employee should use the first three months in the new position to assess performance and to determine whether the new assignment is the right fit for the employee. If the new position isn\u2019t the right fit, the supervisor should contact NYU PeopleLink .

CEP classes meet Monday through Thursday for about five hours of class each day.   At the beginning levels (Intro\u20132), all classes are taught as integrated language skills classes designed to provide a comprehensive English learning experience.   At the intermediate levels (3\u20136), instruction consists of two morning comprehensive core classes and two afternoon English enrichment and engagement classes. Both core courses integrate all English skills. At these levels, students select two types of afternoon enrichment and engagement classes. One offers focused practice on a specific language or academic skill, such as pronunciation, vocabulary development, and TOEFL prep. The other invites students to explore a topic of interest and to develop their linguistic and cultural fluency and confidence through engaging in the real use of English. Topics include American film, history of New York City, art appreciation and business English.   At advanced levels (7-9), students complete their schedules with ALI electives, ALI advanced evening courses for specific purposes, or NYU School of Professional Studies noncredit classes. This flexibility allows advanced students to fine-tune their course selection to best suit their interests and needs.

What Is a Probationary Period?   The probationary period is the initial period of employment, a kind of \u201ctrial period\u201d, during which the supervisor carefully considers whether the employee is able to meet the standards and expectations of the job and if the employee should be retained by NYU as a \u201cregular\u201d employee (the probationary period does not apply to transfer employees). During this time, the supervisor appraises the employee\u2019s:     Ability to learn and perform job duties   Quality of work   Productivity   Work habits   Cooperation   Attendance   Punctuality   Other standards and expectations specific to the employee\u2019s work situation     If the employee is clearly not meeting the requirements of the job, the employee may be released at any time during the probationary period.   Note: The probationary period is intended to be used to determine whether the right employee has been hired for the job. Once the probationary period ends, the process for releasing an employee generally requires further documentation.   Probationary Periods for Each Group   The probationary period for each group is different:                 Group  Probationary Period  Administrators and Professionals and Professional Research Staff (below level of director or equivalent) Six months from date of hire  Office and Clerical and Laboratory and Technical Staff Three months from date of hire  Service Staff Consult the applicable collective bargaining agreement      Note (for all groups): If a full-time temporary employee becomes a full-time regular employee in the same position for which he or she was originally hired, the time worked as a temporary employee is credited toward the completion of the probationary period.   Extension of Probation   Under special circumstances a probationary period may be extended if the supervisor needs more time to appraise the employee. An extension must be requested at least one week in advance of the end of the probationary period and all extensions need to be approved by the Deputy Director of Talent, Learning and Organizational Development. Additionally, extensions for Office and Clerical or Laboratory and Technical staff positions must also be approved by the Local 3882, the collective bargaining agent for these employees.   Determining If the Employee Passes the Probationary Period   If a supervisor decides to keep the employee on staff beyond the probationary period, he or she must complete a Probationary Review Form and return it to the department\u2019s HR Officer. NYU's Employee Relations Office sends the Human Resources Officer notification several weeks before the end of the probationary period to allow the supervisor enough time to think about the employee\u2019s performance and to schedule a meeting with the employee just prior to the end of the probationary period to discuss performance.   Note: No department should retain an employee beyond the last day of the probationary period unless they have an official extension or they intend for the employee to pass probation.   Once the employee has passed the probationary period, he or she becomes a regular staff member and is eligible for all benefits available for that job classification. For details on employee benefit options, select &quot; Benefits &quot; or email askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .   Documenting Problems or Misconduct   Formal written warnings and other documentation usually are not required during the probationary period. However, serious problems or misconduct may warrant documentation. Consult with your HR Officer for further assistance in these matters.   Terminating an Employee After the Probationary Period   If a supervisor decides to terminate an employee after he or she has passed the probationary period, the supervisor should consult with his or her HR Officer to discuss the relevant performance issues. Since most employees have access to a grievance and arbitration procedure, documentation may be requested for further review. Guidance and assistance regarding termination may also be secured from the Office of Employee Relations at 212-998-1290.   Transfers: The First Three Months   Although there is no official probationary period for an employee who transfers to another position, the supervisor and employee should use the first three months in the new position to assess performance and to determine whether the new assignment is the right fit for the employee. If the new position isn\u2019t the right fit, the supervisor should contact NYU PeopleLink .
