We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.

These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity?

FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Beasts and Books Prof. Kay (French)   syllabus According to the Book of Genesis, human beings have two distinct relationships with other animals: in one version of the creation story Adam gives them names, in the other they are created to keep him company. Whether non-human animals are creatures to which we assign meanings, or whether they are our interlocutors, is thus a dilemma formulated from the outset. It will provide the overall framework for this course in we examine how animals are interpreted metaphorically or symbolically, as if they were texts, and how they are also represented as speaking to us, as if they were producers of texts. We work mainly on written documents ranging from the Bible and antiquity through the Middle Ages and the premodern period (mainly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), reaching forward occasionally into the contemporary world for current examples. Some materials are literary (like fables and fairy stories), some philosophical, others historical. We also consider visual materials from manuscript illuminations to recent films. And we evaluate the role of animals in cultural practices other than literary or artistic works\u2014for instance, in hunting or in zoos\u2014and discover how, in this sense, they are like texts that we can read and analyze. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature)  syllabus  \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor)   syllabus  What   is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our   identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and   good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but   the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as   humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates   the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and   Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato,   Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics),   Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal   identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and   see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and   the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some   of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably   Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these,   the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more   threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this   threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the   Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now   find our way. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)  syllabus The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English)  syllabus Examines Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson, Goethe, and Nietzsche. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (MAP)   syllabus  Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)   syllabus  A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 410, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Exile and Belonging\u2014Writing Intensive Prof. Waters (Irish Studies)  syllabus A writing-intensive version of Texts and Ideas offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay. Recommended for students regardless of intended major who seek a deeper engagement with the texts and more attention to writing about them than the regular versions of these courses can provide. While readings and assignments are shared between the lecture and the writing workshops, there are no recitations for this lecture; students must therefore be prepared to do substantial independent work without the support of a recitation section. Open to new CAS first-year students only.   The very possibility of our identity rests on the possibility of our estrangement. This theme haunts Western literature, philosophy, and politics from antiquity to the present. We examine the dynamic of exile and belonging, of place and displacement, by reading closely a series of classical texts that established a framework for thinking about culture, the state, and the individual. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Sophocles' Oedipus, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; Shelley's Frankenstein; Douglass' Narrative of the Life of an American Slave; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Gay Science; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and Disturbance of Memory at the Acropolis; selection from Ovid, Byron, Keats. NOTE: Students must also register for one of the linked section of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay: 016, 017, 018, 020, 021, 023, 025. Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)   syllabus  What is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other. Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola, Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek, Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Paranoid Narratives Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature)   syllabus  It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Guilt and Sin, Law and Justice Prof. Maudlin (Philosophy)  syllabus The   nature of justice, the legitimacy of law, and the justification for   punishment. We begin with Biblical accounts of sin and retribution,   Greek myths on the origin of the legal system, and the trial and   execution of Socrates. Turning to more modern works, we consider   theories of natural rights and the origin of legitimate states through   social contract, ending with three novels that present challenging views   of crime, the legal system, and the human soul. Readings: Genesis,   Exodus; Euripides\u2019 Oresteia; Plato\u2019s Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic;   Paine\u2019s Rights of Man; Melville\u2019s Billy Budd; Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and   Punishment; Kafka\u2019s Trial. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation Prof. Watson (English)   syllabus  What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)   syllabus  The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past.

SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French)   syllabus  The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores   the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the   political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems   of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to   the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the   economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of   the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day.   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides'   Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid;   Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels'   Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species;   Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its   Discontents.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Levene (Classics)   syllabus  Every society places demands on individuals: it could not do otherwise and still remain a society. But what happens when those demands are inconsistent? Can--or should--an individual determine the right course of action by reason alone? Or should one simply obey--but then, whom should one obey? What happens when people's moral judgments differ from the expectations of those around them? How can one maintain a society in the face of such conflicts? From the first moments of Western literature those questions are explored; they became all the more insistent in the unprecedented political, social, intellectual, and economic upheavals of the 19th century. One effect was the increasingly central role given to art itself, seen as the dynamic force able to create a cohesive society. Our study will include Richard Wagner's remarkable music-drama The Ring of the Nibelung, perhaps the most significant and influential art-work of the era (studied primarily as a text, though there will be opportunities to hear the music as well). Other readings will include selections from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures; Homer's Iliad; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Gorgias; Vergil's Aeneid; poetry by (among others) Shelley, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold; Arnold's Culture and Anarchy; Wagner's Art and Revolution; and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality.

FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (MAP)   syllabus  Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)   syllabus  A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 410, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Exile and Belonging\u2014Writing Intensive Prof. Waters (Irish Studies)  syllabus A writing-intensive version of Texts and Ideas offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay. Recommended for students regardless of intended major who seek a deeper engagement with the texts and more attention to writing about them than the regular versions of these courses can provide. While readings and assignments are shared between the lecture and the writing workshops, there are no recitations for this lecture; students must therefore be prepared to do substantial independent work without the support of a recitation section. Open to new CAS first-year students only.   The very possibility of our identity rests on the possibility of our estrangement. This theme haunts Western literature, philosophy, and politics from antiquity to the present. We examine the dynamic of exile and belonging, of place and displacement, by reading closely a series of classical texts that established a framework for thinking about culture, the state, and the individual. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Sophocles' Oedipus, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; Shelley's Frankenstein; Douglass' Narrative of the Life of an American Slave; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Gay Science; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and Disturbance of Memory at the Acropolis; selection from Ovid, Byron, Keats. NOTE: Students must also register for one of the linked section of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay: 016, 017, 018, 020, 021, 023, 025. Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)   syllabus  What is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other. Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola, Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek, Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Paranoid Narratives Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature)   syllabus  It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Guilt and Sin, Law and Justice Prof. Maudlin (Philosophy)  syllabus The   nature of justice, the legitimacy of law, and the justification for   punishment. We begin with Biblical accounts of sin and retribution,   Greek myths on the origin of the legal system, and the trial and   execution of Socrates. Turning to more modern works, we consider   theories of natural rights and the origin of legitimate states through   social contract, ending with three novels that present challenging views   of crime, the legal system, and the human soul. Readings: Genesis,   Exodus; Euripides\u2019 Oresteia; Plato\u2019s Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic;   Paine\u2019s Rights of Man; Melville\u2019s Billy Budd; Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and   Punishment; Kafka\u2019s Trial. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation Prof. Watson (English)   syllabus  What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)   syllabus  The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French)   syllabus  The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores   the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the   political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems   of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to   the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the   economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of   the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day.   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides'   Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid;   Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels'   Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species;   Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its   Discontents.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Levene (Classics)   syllabus  Every society places demands on individuals: it could not do otherwise and still remain a society. But what happens when those demands are inconsistent? Can--or should--an individual determine the right course of action by reason alone? Or should one simply obey--but then, whom should one obey? What happens when people's moral judgments differ from the expectations of those around them? How can one maintain a society in the face of such conflicts? From the first moments of Western literature those questions are explored; they became all the more insistent in the unprecedented political, social, intellectual, and economic upheavals of the 19th century. One effect was the increasingly central role given to art itself, seen as the dynamic force able to create a cohesive society. Our study will include Richard Wagner's remarkable music-drama The Ring of the Nibelung, perhaps the most significant and influential art-work of the era (studied primarily as a text, though there will be opportunities to hear the music as well). Other readings will include selections from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures; Homer's Iliad; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Gorgias; Vergil's Aeneid; poetry by (among others) Shelley, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold; Arnold's Culture and Anarchy; Wagner's Art and Revolution; and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality.

FALL 2011 MAP-UA 400 Texts and Ideas: Topics \u2014 Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English) and Prof. Robles (Media, Culture &amp; Communication) syllabus Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 400 Texts and Ideas: Topics \u2014 The Deliberating Citizen Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus What capacities help us function as citizens\u2014members of a community larger than ourselves, our friends, and our families? Some argue we must develop our capacities of reason and argument; others advocate a transformed conception of the individual. Some focus on the management of emotions, especially affection and sympathy; still others insist on the importance of belief in God, cultivating the imagination, or remembering the past. We read philosophers (Plato, Locke, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt), a historian (Thucydides), and scripture (Genesis and Exodus), and also examine works that address the role of art and music in creating and critiquing civic values: Euripides\u2019 Bacchae, Vergil\u2019s Aeneid, Melville\u2019s \u201cBartleby the Scrivener,\u201d and John Ford\u2019s Westerns. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 400 Texts and Ideas: Topics \u2014 Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature) syllabus \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H.

FALL 2011 MAP-UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition\u2014science and technology\u2014rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Goldwyn (French) syllabus Focuses on voyage, discovery, errantry, and exile in key ancient and Enlightenment texts and how these stories transformed and shaped understanding of the world, the \"other,\" and the self. We examine the way the Enlightenment thinkers revisited, reinterpreted, redefined, and, at times, rejected their intellectual and cultural legacy. Readings: Euripides' Medea; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, and Acts; Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Voltaire's Candide; Diderot's Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville; and Graffigny's Letters from a Peruvian Woman.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Richardson (Philosophy) syllabus The task of understanding the natural world and the relation of humans to it.

Readings from literary, philosophical, and scientific texts, including the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, selections from the pre-Socratics, Sophocles, Aristotle, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, and Darwin. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.

FALL 2011 MAP-UA 412 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance - Writing Intensive Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor) syllabus What is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics), Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these, the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way. Offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay.

SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 400 Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Literature in Wonderland Prof. Momma (English) syllabus How to Play with Language: We use language every day, and yet we do not seem to know exactly how it works. Communicating with others through language sometimes feels like playing a game. But does this mean we have only one language game to play, or that we follow only one set of rules all the time? Just like Alice, who was constantly frustrated by the logic of the inhabitants of Wonderland, we are often baffled by difficulties in communicating even the simplest idea. We explore issues on language that may be raised by reading literary and philosophical texts written by \u201clanguage-conscious\u201d authors: Is language the only way to communicate? Do we know anything about the origin of language? Do grammar and rhetoric help us communicate well or persuade others? Do etymology and the history of English tell us anything new about the language we know already? Do our minds work exactly the same way regardless of the language we speak? How do we do things with words? Readings: Carroll\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Plato\u2019s Cratylus, Aristotle\u2019s Poetics, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Beowulf, Canterbury Tales, Melville\u2019s Bartleby the Scrivener, Borges\u2019 Library of Babel, Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 400 Texts and Ideas: Topics \u2014 Freedom and Oppression Prof. Kunhardt (History) syllabus Examines the human quest for freedom\u2014freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind\u2014as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln.

The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind.

We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English) and Prof. Robles (Media, Culture &amp; Communication)   syllabus  Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Beasts and Books Prof. Kay (French)   syllabus According to the Book of Genesis, human beings have two distinct relationships with other animals: in one version of the creation story Adam gives them names, in the other they are created to keep him company. Whether non-human animals are creatures to which we assign meanings, or whether they are our interlocutors, is thus a dilemma formulated from the outset. It will provide the overall framework for this course in we examine how animals are interpreted metaphorically or symbolically, as if they were texts, and how they are also represented as speaking to us, as if they were producers of texts. We work mainly on written documents ranging from the Bible and antiquity through the Middle Ages and the premodern period (mainly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), reaching forward occasionally into the contemporary world for current examples. Some materials are literary (like fables and fairy stories), some philosophical, others historical. We also consider visual materials from manuscript illuminations to recent films. And we evaluate the role of animals in cultural practices other than literary or artistic works\u2014for instance, in hunting or in zoos\u2014and discover how, in this sense, they are like texts that we can read and analyze. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature)  syllabus  \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor)   syllabus  What   is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our   identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and   good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but   the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as   humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates   the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and   Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato,   Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics),   Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal   identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and   see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and   the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some   of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably   Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these,   the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more   threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this   threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the   Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now   find our way. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)  syllabus The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest.

FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)   syllabus  A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 410, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Exile and Belonging\u2014Writing Intensive Prof. Waters (Irish Studies)  syllabus A writing-intensive version of Texts and Ideas offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay. Recommended for students regardless of intended major who seek a deeper engagement with the texts and more attention to writing about them than the regular versions of these courses can provide. While readings and assignments are shared between the lecture and the writing workshops, there are no recitations for this lecture; students must therefore be prepared to do substantial independent work without the support of a recitation section. Open to new CAS first-year students only.   The very possibility of our identity rests on the possibility of our estrangement. This theme haunts Western literature, philosophy, and politics from antiquity to the present. We examine the dynamic of exile and belonging, of place and displacement, by reading closely a series of classical texts that established a framework for thinking about culture, the state, and the individual. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Sophocles' Oedipus, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; Shelley's Frankenstein; Douglass' Narrative of the Life of an American Slave; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Gay Science; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and Disturbance of Memory at the Acropolis; selection from Ovid, Byron, Keats. NOTE: Students must also register for one of the linked section of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay: 016, 017, 018, 020, 021, 023, 025. Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)   syllabus  What is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other. Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola, Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek, Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Paranoid Narratives Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature)   syllabus  It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Guilt and Sin, Law and Justice Prof. Maudlin (Philosophy)  syllabus The   nature of justice, the legitimacy of law, and the justification for   punishment. We begin with Biblical accounts of sin and retribution,   Greek myths on the origin of the legal system, and the trial and   execution of Socrates. Turning to more modern works, we consider   theories of natural rights and the origin of legitimate states through   social contract, ending with three novels that present challenging views   of crime, the legal system, and the human soul. Readings: Genesis,   Exodus; Euripides\u2019 Oresteia; Plato\u2019s Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic;   Paine\u2019s Rights of Man; Melville\u2019s Billy Budd; Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and   Punishment; Kafka\u2019s Trial. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation Prof. Watson (English)   syllabus  What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed.

Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores   the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the   political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems   of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to   the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the   economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of   the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day.   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides'   Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid;   Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels'   Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species;   Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its   Discontents.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Levene (Classics)   syllabus  Every society places demands on individuals: it could not do otherwise and still remain a society. But what happens when those demands are inconsistent? Can--or should--an individual determine the right course of action by reason alone? Or should one simply obey--but then, whom should one obey? What happens when people's moral judgments differ from the expectations of those around them? How can one maintain a society in the face of such conflicts? From the first moments of Western literature those questions are explored; they became all the more insistent in the unprecedented political, social, intellectual, and economic upheavals of the 19th century. One effect was the increasingly central role given to art itself, seen as the dynamic force able to create a cohesive society. Our study will include Richard Wagner's remarkable music-drama The Ring of the Nibelung, perhaps the most significant and influential art-work of the era (studied primarily as a text, though there will be opportunities to hear the music as well). Other readings will include selections from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures; Homer's Iliad; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Gorgias; Vergil's Aeneid; poetry by (among others) Shelley, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold; Arnold's Culture and Anarchy; Wagner's Art and Revolution; and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality.

Some focus on the management of emotions, especially affection and sympathy; still others insist on the importance of belief in God, cultivating the imagination, or remembering the past. We read philosophers (Plato, Locke, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt), a historian (Thucydides), and scripture (Genesis and Exodus), and also examine works that address the role of art and music in creating and critiquing civic values: Euripides\u2019 Bacchae, Vergil\u2019s Aeneid, Melville\u2019s \u201cBartleby the Scrivener,\u201d and John Ford\u2019s Westerns. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 400 Texts and Ideas: Topics \u2014 Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature) syllabus \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 402 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English) syllabus The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition\u2014science and technology\u2014rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Goldwyn (French) syllabus Focuses on voyage, discovery, errantry, and exile in key ancient and Enlightenment texts and how these stories transformed and shaped understanding of the world, the \"other,\" and the self. We examine the way the Enlightenment thinkers revisited, reinterpreted, redefined, and, at times, rejected their intellectual and cultural legacy. Readings: Euripides' Medea; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, and Acts; Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Voltaire's Candide; Diderot's Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville; and Graffigny's Letters from a Peruvian Woman.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Richardson (Philosophy) syllabus The task of understanding the natural world and the relation of humans to it. In particular, does that world need to be understood through ends or purposes\u2014and what might the end or purpose of human life be? Readings from literary, philosophical, and scientific texts, including the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, selections from the pre-Socratics, Sophocles, Aristotle, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, and Darwin. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (MAP) syllabus Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Rosenberg and Bloom's Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Job; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality, Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 412 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance - Writing Intensive Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor) syllabus What is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics), Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these, the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way. Offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay. FALL 2011 MAP-UA 414 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century - Writing Intensive Prof. Renzi (MAP) syllabus Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it.

SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 400 Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Utopias and Distopias Prof. Kotsonis (Russian and Slavic Studies) syllabus Considers how writers and other artists over the past two millennia have imagined perfect and just societies and, more recently, how they imagined perfectly unjust and nightmarish societies and implied what would restore them. Readings: Plato\u2019s Republic, Xenophon\u2019s Anabasis, More\u2019s Utopia, Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto, Wells\u2019 Time Machine, Bellamy\u2019s Looking Backward, Sinclair\u2019s The Jungle, Zamiatin\u2019s We, Bulgakov\u2019s Heart of a Dog, Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, Orwell\u2019s 1984. Films: Starship Troopers, Demolition Man. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 400 Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Literature in Wonderland Prof. Momma (English) syllabus How to Play with Language: We use language every day, and yet we do not seem to know exactly how it works. Communicating with others through language sometimes feels like playing a game. But does this mean we have only one language game to play, or that we follow only one set of rules all the time? Just like Alice, who was constantly frustrated by the logic of the inhabitants of Wonderland, we are often baffled by difficulties in communicating even the simplest idea. We explore issues on language that may be raised by reading literary and philosophical texts written by \u201clanguage-conscious\u201d authors: Is language the only way to communicate? Do we know anything about the origin of language? Do grammar and rhetoric help us communicate well or persuade others? Do etymology and the history of English tell us anything new about the language we know already? Do our minds work exactly the same way regardless of the language we speak? How do we do things with words? Readings: Carroll\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Plato\u2019s Cratylus, Aristotle\u2019s Poetics, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Beowulf, Canterbury Tales, Melville\u2019s Bartleby the Scrivener, Borges\u2019 Library of Babel, Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 400 Texts and Ideas: Topics \u2014 Freedom and Oppression Prof. Kunhardt (History) syllabus Examines the human quest for freedom\u2014freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind\u2014as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 402 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English) syllabus The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus Focuses   on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the   Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have   important implications for society and the individual. They lead to   alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should   exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the   nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the   Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in   mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles'   Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium;   Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus;   Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise;   Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the   English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French) syllabus The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\"  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English) syllabus Examines Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson, Goethe, and Nietzsche. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.

Students read and write about the  course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section  of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1).      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th  Century\u2014Writing Intensive   MAP-UA 414 Offered in the fall. 4  points.   The same as MAP-UA 404, but with  additional emphasis on writing. Students read and write about the  course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section  of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1).         Cultures and Contexts      Cultures and Contexts: Islamic  Societies   MAP-UA 502 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the common base and regional  variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here  understood as one that shares, either as operative present or  historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For  Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but  also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical,  topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first  on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and  mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search  for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic  societies in the words of their own writings.      Cultures and Contexts: Africa   MAP-UA 505 Offered every year. 4  points.   Key concepts related to understanding  sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, concentrating in  particular on teaching students how to think critically and consult  sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include  problems in the interpretation of African literature, African  history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and  values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the  slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the  difficulties of and means for translating and interpreting the system  of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms  meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current  philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white  accounts of African societies and the place of women in them. Issues  are approached with the use of analyses from history, anthropology,  sociology, literary theory, and philosophy.      Cultures and Contexts: The Chinese and  Japanese Traditions   MAP-UA 506 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Essential aspects of Asian  culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism\u2014studied  through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature.  A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant  to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less  obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of  Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese  legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China,  show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western  invasions.      Cultures and Contexts: Japan\u2014A  Cultural History   MAP-UA 507 Offered every other year. 4  points.   A consideration of the prehistory to  Japan's modernist transformation through an analysis of key  literary, religious, and artistic texts. Concentrates on the  historical experiences that produced elements of a national culture  before there was a nation and on the consciousness of being Japanese  before there was a \"Japan.\" Examines how key cultural elements  were used to make a modern nation-state.      Cultures and Contexts: The Pacific  Islands   MAP-UA 508 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The Pacific Island region sweeps from  Easter Island in the East to Papua New Guinea in the West, a vast  \"sea of islands\" that has been a crucial space of exchange: of  perspectives, materials, people, and ideas. What can we learn from  the study of this region, a set of islands with both commonalities  and differences that is often imagined as one \"place\"? We examine  the cultures of the Pacific Islands, moving from the first migrations  of indigenous navigators through the age of European exploration and  colonialism, to the local experience of World War II and contemporary  engagements with globalization. We also study the area's unique  cultural configurations of ritual practice, cosmology, and society.  Along the way, we engage directly with the voices of Pacific  islanders, from those who participated in the voyages of Captain  Cook, to indigenous artists who reflect on these complex and  entangled histories. Other primary sources include museum  collections, film, painting, and other visual representations. This  comparative approach enables us to understand debates about colonial  encounter, primitivism, cannibalism, cargo cults, nuclear testing,  resource extraction, and the morality of diet, from a Pacific  perspective.      Cultures and Contexts: Middle Eastern  Societies   MAP-UA 511 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The popular American picture of the  Middle East as a place of violence, veiled women, and oil wealth  portrays none of the richness or complexity of most people's lives  in the region. How can we make sense of these seemingly unfamiliar  societies and think critically about Western images of the  unfamiliar? Questions examined in depth include the following: What  variety of sources do people in the Middle East draw on to define  their sense of who they are\u2014as members of particular households,  regions, nations, or religious communities? How do women and men  construct their gender identity? In what ways are village, town, and  city lives being transformed? Do people of the Middle East experience  their region's politics the way it is portrayed in the West? What  are some of the causes of political repression, armed struggle, or  terror? How did European colonialism reshape the lives of people in  the region, and how do they today encounter the cultural and economic  power of the United States and Europe? Readings are drawn from  history, anthropology, political economy, and the contemporary  literature of the region.      Cultures and Contexts: China   MAP-UA 512 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Fundamental concepts and practices of  Chinese society and culture, examined using primary sources in  translation whenever possible. By studying the social, political,  religious, ideological, ritual, economic, and cultural life of the  Chinese, students gain a sense of the core values and issues of  Chinese civilization and how these have affected and continue to have  an impact on the way people think and live.      Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel   MAP-UA 514 Offered every semester. 4  points.   The culture of the ancient Israelite  societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200  B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century  B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the  areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite  religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves  much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological  excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery  of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added  greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times.  The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on  Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of  Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the  mother religion of Christianity and Islam.      Cultures and Contexts: Latin America   MAP-UA 515 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the cultural, social, and  political organization of indigenous people before the period of  European colonization. Studies the dynamics of the colonial  encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous responses to  European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development,  and the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow students to hear diverse voices within Latin  American society. Works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves are  studied. Novels, short stories, films, photographs, and music are  also included.      Cultures and Contexts: India   MAP-UA 516 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Considers the paradoxes of modern  India: ancient religious ideas coexisting with material progress,  hierarchical caste society with parliamentary democracy, and urban  shantytowns with palatial high-rises. Integrates research on India's  cultural values with social-scientific perspectives on their  contemporary relevance. Examines problems such as protective  discrimination for lower castes and cultural nationalism. Shows how  democracy involves difficult choices among competing, often opposed,  ancient and modern cultural values.      Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary  Latino Cultures   MAP-UA 529 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the growth and development of  \"Latino\" as a distinct category of identity out of the highly  diverse populations of Latin American background in the United  States, paying particular attention to the social processes shaping  its emergence. Provides a detailed examination of the processes of  cultural creation behind the rising growth of transnational cultures  and identities worldwide, and of the forces that are fueling their  development. Begins by exploring the immigration of Latin American  peoples to U.S. cities, then turns to three case studies of emerging  Latino communities, and ends by examining contemporary issues  involving Latinos in urban centers such as New York.      Cultures and Contexts: The African  Diaspora   MAP-UA 532 Offered every year. 4  points.   The dispersal of Africans to various  parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and  those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the  Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and  freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their  relationship to both African and non-African influences.      Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous  Australia   MAP-UA 536 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The indigenous people of Australia have  long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for  their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and  politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively  \"other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the  \"primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them  such as Walkabout and Rabbit-Proof Fence, in New Age literature, or  in museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms  of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have  struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own  terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and  self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range  of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic  texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film, and other media, and  consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and  constructed.      Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel   MAP-UA 537 Offered every year. 4  points.   Despite its small size and population,  Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its  ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic  origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years are  examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20  percent) in Israeli society is discussed. The special role of  religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew-speaking  culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace  movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life  are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether  Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the  controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched  on, the focus is on the character of Israeli society and the impact  on everyday life of living in the international limelight.      Cultures and Contexts:  Asian/Pacific/American Cultures   MAP-UA 539 Offered every year. 4  points.   Major issues in the historical and  contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including  migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and  political mobilization. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex,  diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. Particular  attention is given to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions  (films, literature, art, media, and popular culture) as an expression  and reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions,  and political efforts.      Cultures and Contexts: New World  Encounters   MAP-UA 541 Offered every year. 4  points.   What was America before it was called  America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their  first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and  cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of  the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home  to several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire,  and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and  later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the  Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new  world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by  conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their  experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from  these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation  of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary  documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\"  including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with  historical and theoretical texts.      Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the  Pharaohs   MAP-UA 545 Offered every year. 4  points.   The archaeology, literature, and art of  ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of  special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and  ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity.  Settlements that are particularly well documented through both  archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir  el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social  experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on  gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal).  Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing,  attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through  avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the  construction of well-crafted satire. Primary sources include letters,  wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, and  physical anthropology.        Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia   MAP-UA 546 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the expansive transformation  of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on  networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that  form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with  others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the  formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows the tracks of  Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion and then turns to  the age of early modern landed empires,  Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with  seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of  culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions,  during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise  of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese  expansion around the Pacific Rim. Concludes by considering cultural  change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on  entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the  market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor  migration, as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York  City, including our nearby Chinatown.      Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the  Americas   MAP-UA 550 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The idea of \"America\" has long been  dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists,  policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has  sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \"Old  World\" tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of  imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various  cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on  studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of  race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events  (e.g., 19th- and 20th-century migrations of Asians to Central  America) and explore how global visions and international movements  as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism,  cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 emerge from local currents  and practices.      Cultures and Contexts: Immigrant  America in the 19th Century   MAP-UA 551 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The \"long nineteenth century,\" from  the 1820s through the 1920s, saw the arrival of no fewer than 50  million immigrants to the United States. Coming primarily, although  not exclusively, from Europe, their migrations not only transformed  the places they left, but profoundly altered American society. These  migrations, all of which involved a high degree of choice on the part  of their participants, took place within the context of family and  communal decision making, which in turn impacted significantly on the  women and men who made these journeys, allowing\u2014or forcing\u2014them  to create new kinds of identities, institutions, and cultures.  Indeed, as a result of their migrations, they became new people. They  became \"ethnic,\" as they had to redefine themselves both in terms  of what they left, what they \"brought\" with them, and what they  encountered in America. We explore how their journeys led to the  creation of a set of ethnic communities in America, which we can see  as specific and unique and yet resembling each other in notable ways,  focusing on three seemingly very different 19th-century groups:  Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants, and the ethnic cultures they  created.      Cultures &amp; Contexts: Topics\u2014Empires  and Political Imagination   MAP-UA 552 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Comparative study of empires, from the  Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and  constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power.  Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that  consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a  language and culture. Empires\u2014polities that maintained social and  cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2014have  been one of the most common and durable forms of political  organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must   take account of how people lived in  empires\u2014sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes  accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend  their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of  citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is  natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held  together\u2014and where they were weak\u2014from perspectives that focus on  political and economic connections over long distances and long time  periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of  empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings  include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol,  Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as  primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial  polities.         Societies and the Social Sciences      Note that the prerequisite for all  Societies and the Social Sciences courses is completion of Texts and  Ideas (MAP-UA 4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as  completion of (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1),   Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Societies and the Social Sciences:  Topics in Interdisciplinary Perspective   MAP-UA 600 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines social phenomena that cross  the boundaries among the various social-scientific disciplines.  Topics vary each term and may include, for example, human migration,  religion, fascism, or colonialism. By considering the methodologies  appropriate to the study of these topics, students learn to  appreciate the characteristic approaches of the social sciences,  their power to help us understand such phenomena, and their  limitations.         Expressive Culture      Note that the prerequisite for all  Expressive Culture courses is completion of Texts and Ideas (MAP-UA  4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as completion of  (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Expressive Culture: Words   MAP-UA 710 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is literature or the literary? Is  there a literary language that works differently from ordinary  language? What is literary style and form? What is the position of  the writer or artist in relation to society, and what is the function  of the reader? Is literature a mirror of the world that it describes,  an attempt to influence a reader's ideas or opinions, an expression  of the identity of the writer, or none of these?      Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel   MAP-UA 711 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines the interplay between words  and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of  communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film. What  is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology,  time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures?  What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors  include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns,  and Carla Speed McNeil.      Expressive Culture: Images   MAP-UA 720 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is the place of art in an  image-saturated world? We begin by considering the power and taboo of  images and the ways in which individuals and institutions that  constitute \"the art world\" classify some of these images as works  of art; turn to explore the visual and conceptual challenges  presented by major works of sculpture, architecture, and painting;  and conclude with a selection of problems raised by art today.  Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate and question the  artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and times.      Expressive Culture: Painting and  Sculpture in New York Field Study   MAP-UA 721 Offered every spring. 4  points.   New York's public art collections  contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost  every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost  works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period  and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums  or other locations where these works are exhibited.      Expressive Culture: Architecture in New  York Field Study   MAP-UA 722 Offered every fall. 4  points.   New York's rich architectural  heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of  the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its  social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an  extended period and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions  to prominent buildings. Consideration is given both to individual  buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture, as well  as to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the  adaptation of older buildings to new uses.      Expressive Culture: Sounds   MAP-UA 730 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Our lives pulsate with patterns of  sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes,  cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery  store, the dentist's office, and the movies. Yet we rarely think  consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case  studies, we investigate the function and significance of music and  the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music  has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse  historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among  different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion  of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess  the value of music in human experience.      Expressive Culture: Performance   MAP-UA 740 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines \"performance\" both as a  practice and as a theoretical tool with which to understand today's  world. The broad spectrum of live performance is explored by means of  lectures, discussions, and field trips. Students look at theatre and  dance, performance in everyday life, rituals, popular entertainments,  and intercultural performance. On the theoretical level, students are  introduced to \"speech acts,\" \"restored behavior,\" \"ritual  process,\" and \"play.\" Students see a broad variety of  performances, such as Native American powwow, Indian Hindu ritual  drama, off-Broadway theatre and dance, African American gospel,  street performers, and courtroom trials.      Expressive Culture: Film   MAP-UA 750 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Film is a medium that combines a number  of arts. It lies at the intersection of art and technology and of art  and mass culture, and at the boundaries of the national and the  global. Film is also a medium that coincides with and contributes to  the invention of modern life. By exploring the expressive and  representational achievements of cinema in the context of modernity  and mass culture, students learn the concepts to grasp the different  ways in which films create meaning, achieve their emotional impact,  and respond in complex ways to the historical contexts in which they  are made.
