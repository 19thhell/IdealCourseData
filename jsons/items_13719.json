Students graduating from the Undergraduate College with a major in finance accept prestigious positions with banks, investment banking houses, government agencies, consulting firms, insurance firms, and large and small corporations. Careers range from credit analysis to product profitability analysis to apprentice floor traders on exchanges. In addition to being well-grounded in finance, our students graduate prepared to work with multinational managers, marketing professionals, accountants, and others who depend on finance professionals to supply the analysis necessary to make profitable future decisions.    Being a part of a world-class university in the heart of New York City means that Stern students have unique opportunities not available at other universities. As part of their career preparation, all finance students are encouraged to take advantage of the many lectures and informal talks by leading business executives arranged by student clubs and the Dean\u2019s Office.
