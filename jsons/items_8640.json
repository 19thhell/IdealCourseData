                                                   Catherine Moore    Clinical Associate Professor of Music Business              Phone: 212 998 5427    Email: catherine.moore@nyu.edu         Departments:         Music and Performing Arts Professions       Programs:          Music Business              Professor Moore's specialist fields include strategic music marketing, analysis of current trends in the entertainment industry, cultural trade politics, and 17th-century Italian music. Her keynote addresses, research, and publications address significant changes in the music industry on a global scale, and lectures at universities in Britain, The Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Canada and the United States reflect her international experience and inform her teaching. Examples of papers and publications is provided below and on the right. A graduate of Bishop's University, Canada (Honours B.A., English Literature) and the Conservatoire de musique in Montreal (Organ Performance), Catherine Moore completed a PhD in musicology at The University of Liverpool, England in 1991. Her doctoral thesis, which explores the life and music of the 17th-century Italian composer and violinist Michelangelo Rossi, was published as a book in 1993.   Catherine Moore is regularly interviewed on a range of topics: http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/news/2014/10/16/Music_Business_Professors_in_the_News has details of some of the most recent media quotes. Dr. Moore gave a keynote address in London in October 2012 (at the Royal Academy of Music) about ways that artists have to give their music a sense of \"eventfulness\" to stand out in the age of instant digital on-demand . Her case studies were Marianne Faithfull's songs in a 1975 film and 2012 Liverpool exhibition, and the music of the London 2012 Olympics Closing Ceremony. In November 2014, she spoke at a conference at University of Newcastle in the UK, presenting the paper \"Second Fiddle: Record Labels in the Time of Participatory Audiences, User-Generated Distribution, and Shared Authority\" .   Catherine Moore started in the music business in 1981 managing a retail store in Liverpool, England. Since then, she has been sales manager for Harmonia Mundi Records in London, international marketing manager for Nimbus Records at their Welsh headquarters, and a marketing director (jazz and classical music) for A&amp;M Records in New York. While in New York, she served on the local N.A.R.A.S. Board of Governors and on the Classical Screening Committee for the Grammy Awards. In 1990, she started her own marketing consultancy company, discussion c.m. , in Montreal, relocating to New York in 1992.   Dr. Moore has taught at NYU since 1995, was Director of the Music Business Graduate Program 2005-2013 as is now Director of the Music Business Program. She now teaches and advises undergraduate and graduate students, and was also Director of both the Undergraduate and Graduate Music Business Programs from 1997-2005. Professional affiliations: Music Entertainment Industry Educators Association, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, American Musicological Society, Society for Seventeenth-Century Music, and the Association of Arts Administration Educators.   Catherine Moore has served on the Advisory Board of the Center for Contemporary Music at Danube University, Krems, Austria, where she was a member of the International Guest Faculty from 2005 to 2009.   Teaching initiatives include:   Multi-national comparative research study of music trends and music business trends -- this study is conducted in real time with students in study abroad sites. In Fall 2013 students are in Shanghai, Prague, and Argentina.   Developer of real-world and virtual-reality assignments to teach students how to be pro-active as A&amp;R talent scouts. Collaborations with independent and major music companies bring actual business problems into the classroom.   Author -- with a group of graduate students -- of a case study, Bridging the Music and Marketing Businesses Through the International Nightclub Scene . The study was used in graduate classes. It examines topics such as night club goers tolerance for in-club advertising, new methods of marketing such as in-club holograms, and how to measure the success of a business in which exclusive entry and small audiences are what fans value most.   Governance roles: Prof. Moore currently serves as a member of the NYU Steinhardt Global Advisory Committee, and on several other committees. From 2003-2006 she served as Steinhardt Senator representing the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions, and chaired the Steinhardt Student Affairs Committee. In 2014 she was elected as an at-large Senator and now serves on the Steinhardt Senate.   Qualifications :   BA, Bishop's University (Canada); BMus, Conservatoire de musique de Montreal (Canada); PhD, University of Liverpool (UK)   Experience :   16 years in the record business -- first of all managing a record store in Liverpool, England -- in the UK, Canada, and the US; teaching at NYU since 1995; Program Director since 1997. Consulting for major and indie companies, as well as expert witness in a price-fixing case that set precedents for joint-venture rules. Innovation in classes by using projects based in new social networking/virtual reality tools and setting up collaboration with students in different parts of the world.   Why I Decided to Work in the Music Industry :   To be part of the mechanism that allows music to travel across the world and bring about cultural and economic change. There is not a culture in the world that does not have music. Sharing in the fun, yet seriously competitive, spirit of my colleagues at A&amp;M Records in New York. Seeing the profound difference that music made in the lives of the customers in the Liverpool record store. Learning from the retired police constable who had heard every major opera singer in Liverpool before they set off by ocean liner to sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.   What I Like Most About Teaching :   Being influential in giving students the knowledge and confidence to put ideas together in new ways. Knowing that students' work in assignments trains them to make decisions about tough topics in the music business: setting strategy in times of uncertainly, engaging the ambiguous business environment, and being fearless. The first time a student says, \"I don't agree with that viewpoint, and this is why\". Watching our alumni make a real difference in the business.   Class Tips for Students :   Don't be afraid to ask for help. Teachers are passionate about their subjects and want you to learn. Always introduce yourself to non-majors in your music business classes - not only is it polite, it's a smart networking move.   Career Tips for Students :   Remember that the music business is much, much bigger than record labels in Manhattan. Don't limit yourself: we are training you for jobs that don't exist yet. Take advantage of the resources of NYU and our alumni, who are spread all over the world in many music industry sectors. Whenever you hear someone from the music industry speak, write down their name and one of their comments you want to remember. There are few people who won't respond to a personal letter, even years later, that quotes something interesting they said.   Outside Interests :   Travel in the UK. Driving on the left side of the road. Montreal Expos fan -- yes, I know they moved to D.C., but I'm still a fan, and look forward to even more Expos in the Hall of Fame.   Favorite Music   As a music lover -- Bach, The Beatles, Joe Jackson, Marillion, Monteverdi, Michelangelo Rossi, Throwing Snow, U2. As a business person -- the big hits on the charts (and, yes, charts still do influence the public and generate a lot of revenue), and music that makes more money along the ever-changing supply chain. I'm always a fan of music our alumni make, produce, promote, and nurture.            Education        B.A. Hons Bishop's University (Canada) 1976, English literature, final thesis on James Joyce.

Keynote address given in September 2005 at the opening of a new M.A. in music management degree program in Krems, Austria. International Music Marketing as Translation, Paper presented in June 2005 at the IASPM/Memorial University conference \"Post-Colonial Distances: The Study of Popular Music in Canada and Australia\" in Newfoundland, Canada. The paper uses translation theory (Umberto Eco, George Steiner and others) to suggest how the translator-marketer can utilize the marketing \"energy\" inherent within music to move that music to another place. The pop music industry's strength lies in the universality of its multiple meanings. Love lyrics, dance beats, and pop melodies travel the world with no need of translation. But less universal music -- including many genres and languages -- needs marketers who can dig deeply into the music's verbal and non-verbal languages and translate without betrayal.( view ) Cultural Variety as Music Business Strategy: Enriching the Repertoire or Pandering for Profit? Presented in July 2004 at the Symposium of the International Musicological Society Melbourne, Australia.( view ) International Musicological Congress, Professor Moore chaired a session at the International Musicological Congress (Leuven, Belgium) in August 2002 on case studies in music distribution -- the case studies were from Russia, Italy and The Netherlands.
