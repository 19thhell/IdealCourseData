(2) Figures of abandonment, of precariousness and of disavowal recur, in the most diverse ways, in a large part of recent literary fiction, reflecting directly or obliquely, depending on the specific case, radical transformations of the political and of the relation between politics and literature.

The course will be organized around two axes that condense determining aspects of recent literary work in Latin America: (1) Writings of the \u201cI\u201d: The question of the relation between biography and fiction, between intimacy and public exhibition(ism), and of new modes of constructing subjectivity constitutes one of the most recurrent critical debates of the present. We will explore these questions in texts by Fernando Vallejo, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alan Pauls and Sylvia Molloy, among others. (2) Figures of abandonment, of precariousness and of disavowal recur, in the most diverse ways, in a large part of recent literary fiction, reflecting directly or obliquely, depending on the specific case, radical transformations of the political and of the relation between politics and literature. We will explore how literature reformulates different juridical, economic, affective and social modalities of abandonment as a sign of the present, turning to texts by Rodolfo Fogwill, Mario Bellat\u00edn, and Martin Kohan, and films de Lucrecia Martel and Eduardo Coutinho, among others.

M.A. in Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language and TESOL Jointly offered by NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science and Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, this innovative degree program allows students to spend one year at NYU Madrid and one year at NYU's main campus in New York City. The goal of this program is to provide students with professional training in teaching of English and Spanish as second languages. Students will also gain mastery of the Spanish language through an immersive year living and studying in Spain. For more information about this program and to apply, please click here .  M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies NYU\u2019s Graduate School of Arts and Science offers a unique one-year M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies at NYU Madrid. With courses taught entirely in Spanish by NYU Madrid faculty, as well as by professors from Spanish universities, the M.A. brings an interdisciplinary and transatlantic perspective to the study of the Spanish-speaking world. A young, ethnically diverse, and culturally vibrant city, Madrid is home to growing Latin American communities, a focal point where the Iberian and Latin American worlds meet. The program takes full advantage of the vast range of cultural activities and events in Madrid, which form an integral part of the curriculum. Students have access to some of the most resourceful libraries and archives in the world and also benefit from membership to the historic Instituto Internacional and its excellent library. Depending on their interests and career goals, students choose one of two concentrations: Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America or Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America . The capstone M.A. project allows students to develop an original scholarly work with the guidance of a faculty advisor, and to present a portion of this work at the Graduate Research Conference. The M.A. program is designed to encourage students to immerse themselves linguistically and culturally in Madrid life. All students are provided with a Madrid Cultura y Arte membership card to attend events, screenings, talks, shows, and exhibitions of their choice throughout the year. An integral part of the core curriculum and orientation program, visits and study trips give students the unique opportunity to investigate Spanish culture in situ. Whether studying urban space in Bilbao, transatlantic trade in Seville, or Roman architecture in Segovia, students are guided by faculty experts. Concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America Students with a concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies develop their interests in literary and critical theory, peninsular and Latin American literature, and the arts and culture of both regions. While most students who choose this option are interested in pursuing a doctoral degree and/or teaching at the college or university level, others go on to careers in secondary education or in other fields in which they can use their thorough knowledge and understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. Concentration in Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America The concentration in Applied Linguistics emphasizes three main research areas within the historical, political, and cultural context of the Spanish-speaking world: general linguistics, psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic theories, second language teaching and acquisition, and translation studies. The program is designed for students interested in pursuing a doctoral degree in these fields or others related to Applied Linguistics, as well as for those whose professions (primary or secondary education, business, community service, government, international affairs, etc.) would benefit from advanced training. The concentration is not designed for students who wish to go on to a Ph.D. degree in literature. Why choose NYU Madrid? The unique one-year M.A. program offers graduate students rigorous academic training to develop their own research interests and approaches to debates in linguistic, literary, and cultural studies, often cutting across disciplinary boundaries. The design of the program aims to foster student responsibility and independence when exploring and generating new areas of knowledge in dialogue with the academic community at large, and beyond. NYU Madrid draws from the diverse expertise of its faculty within a local and global network of universities, research institutions, and cultural centers and museums, at the very core of our graduate students\u2019 experience in Madrid. Our challenge to students to develop their own goals for the program, met with the flexibility of its design and faculty encouragement to pursue independent research, has made for a successful combination. The M.A. program has served as a platform for students who wish to pursue a doctoral degree in their chosen field of studies and for those who aim to use their linguistic and cultural knowledge of the Spanish-speaking world for the benefit of their professions. Attracting students from diverse backgrounds in the United States and abroad, the M.A. program provides a forum to exchange ideas and explore new critical perspectives in which academic pursuits are inseparable from vital experience.

We will explore these questions in texts by Fernando Vallejo, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alan Pauls and Sylvia Molloy, among others. (2) Figures of abandonment, of precariousness and of disavowal recur, in the most diverse ways, in a large part of recent literary fiction, reflecting directly or obliquely, depending on the specific case, radical transformations of the political and of the relation between politics and literature.

M.A. in Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language and TESOL Jointly offered by NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science and Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, this innovative degree program allows students to spend one year at NYU Madrid and one year at NYU's main campus in New York City. The goal of this program is to provide students with professional training in teaching of English and Spanish as second languages. Students will also gain mastery of the Spanish language through an immersive year living and studying in Spain. For more information about this program and to apply, please click here .  M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies NYU\u2019s Graduate School of Arts and Science offers a unique one-year M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies at NYU Madrid. With courses taught entirely in Spanish by NYU Madrid faculty, as well as by professors from Spanish universities, the M.A. brings an interdisciplinary and transatlantic perspective to the study of the Spanish-speaking world. A young, ethnically diverse, and culturally vibrant city, Madrid is home to growing Latin American communities, a focal point where the Iberian and Latin American worlds meet. The program takes full advantage of the vast range of cultural activities and events in Madrid, which form an integral part of the curriculum. Students have access to some of the most resourceful libraries and archives in the world and also benefit from membership to the historic Instituto Internacional and its excellent library. Depending on their interests and career goals, students choose one of two concentrations: Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America or Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America . The capstone M.A. project allows students to develop an original scholarly work with the guidance of a faculty advisor, and to present a portion of this work at the Graduate Research Conference. The M.A. program is designed to encourage students to immerse themselves linguistically and culturally in Madrid life. All students are provided with a Madrid Cultura y Arte membership card to attend events, screenings, talks, shows, and exhibitions of their choice throughout the year. An integral part of the core curriculum and orientation program, visits and study trips give students the unique opportunity to investigate Spanish culture in situ. Whether studying urban space in Bilbao, transatlantic trade in Seville, or Roman architecture in Segovia, students are guided by faculty experts. Concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America Students with a concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies develop their interests in literary and critical theory, peninsular and Latin American literature, and the arts and culture of both regions. While most students who choose this option are interested in pursuing a doctoral degree and/or teaching at the college or university level, others go on to careers in secondary education or in other fields in which they can use their thorough knowledge and understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. Concentration in Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America The concentration in Applied Linguistics emphasizes three main research areas within the historical, political, and cultural context of the Spanish-speaking world: general linguistics, psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic theories, second language teaching and acquisition, and translation studies. The program is designed for students interested in pursuing a doctoral degree in these fields or others related to Applied Linguistics, as well as for those whose professions (primary or secondary education, business, community service, government, international affairs, etc.) would benefit from advanced training. The concentration is not designed for students who wish to go on to a Ph.D. degree in literature. Why choose NYU Madrid? The unique one-year M.A. program offers graduate students rigorous academic training to develop their own research interests and approaches to debates in linguistic, literary, and cultural studies, often cutting across disciplinary boundaries. The design of the program aims to foster student responsibility and independence when exploring and generating new areas of knowledge in dialogue with the academic community at large, and beyond. NYU Madrid draws from the diverse expertise of its faculty within a local and global network of universities, research institutions, and cultural centers and museums, at the very core of our graduate students\u2019 experience in Madrid. Our challenge to students to develop their own goals for the program, met with the flexibility of its design and faculty encouragement to pursue independent research, has made for a successful combination. The M.A. program has served as a platform for students who wish to pursue a doctoral degree in their chosen field of studies and for those who aim to use their linguistic and cultural knowledge of the Spanish-speaking world for the benefit of their professions. Attracting students from diverse backgrounds in the United States and abroad, the M.A. program provides a forum to exchange ideas and explore new critical perspectives in which academic pursuits are inseparable from vital experience.

Students in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) need to fulfill 4 semesters of language as part of their College Core Curriculum (CORE). They can also fulfill their requirement with several placement exams. In-person placement exams in Spanish and Portuguese will be available for CAS students during the summer and throughout the Fall and Spring semesters: http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.placementexams    Portuguese         Spanish speakers with no formal training of Portuguese can  register directly for PORT UA 11 Portuguese for Spanish  Speakers.      Other students with no training in Portuguese can  register for PORT UA 1 Elementary Portuguese I or PORT UA 10  Intensive Elementary Portuguese.      Students with previous formal training and/or familiarity in Portuguese must  go to the College of Arts and Science\u2019s language exam website and take the  online exam, picking Portuguese among the choices: http://www.nyu.edu/cas/flpexam/ . Students will  receive a score placing them in a certain level and must register for that  level.      Students who score above the cutoff can take a written  in-person exam for exemption from the CORE requirement. They must sign up in  advance for the exemption exam. Information on dates and signing up can be  found at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams .  If they wish to continue their study of the language at NYU they must consult  directly with the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu .            Spanish    Students with no previous study of Spanish enroll in SPAN-UA 1 Spanish for Beginners I. Students with 1 year of High School Spanish may enroll in SPAN-UA 1 Spanish for Beginners I or take a placement test to determine placement. All other students must show proof of placement through the SAT II Placement Test (taken either before entering NYU or offered by CAS), the IB exam or the AP Test. If a student does not have any form of placement test available and has taken Spanish before, he/she needs to take the WebCAPE online placement exam (link provided at the end of this page). Students who have not taken a placement test and have taken Spanish before will not be allowed to stay in a course. There are no exceptions to this rule. Students with college Spanish from institutions other than NYU also need to take a placement test. Spanish Speakers : If you are a Spanish (heritage) speaker, you must a take a test in the department (not the online placement exam) for appropriate placement into SPAN-UA 11 (Spanish for Spanish Speakers) or SPAN-UA 111 (Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speakers). Completion of either of these courses will fulfill the language requirement for heritage speakers. Please call 212-998-8770 for more information, or write the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu , or the Coordinator of the Heritage Speakers course for further instructions.  I.

The same is true if they have taken university level Spanish not from an NYU-site. Please note that this exam may not be used to fulfill the CORE requirement; it is only used for placement purposes. The WebCAPE online placement exam in Spanish consists of a series of multiple-choice format questions on vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. Since it is an adaptive test, the length varies from one individual to another, with an average time of 20 minutes. At the exam welcome screen students must provide their name, last name, NYU email and N number. The score and placement recommendation will be notified to the student and to the Department of Spanish and Portuguese immediately upon completion of the exam. Students must print their scores and bring them to class on the first week of classes.    Please be aware that the exam must represent each student\u2019s own work. Students are bound by New York University\u2019s College of Arts and Science Code of Academic Integrity ( http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity ), and must abstain from activities constitutive of fraud.
