[{"detail": [{"content": "Dominique Liana Russo as Dante         Dominique Liana Russo   November 27, 1998       Self versus State: Fall Semester 1998       The Aftermath of Dante Alighieri: His Influence of Society from   Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli to Robin Williams         In China it is believed that the slight breeze from the movement   of a butterflys wing may result in a torrential hurricane in the west. This   ancient belief attests to the existence of what we know as a chain reaction,   and the consequences it is capable of in nature, or in our particular case study,   an established society. In the year 1308, the butterfly became restless once   again with the publication of Dantes Divina Commedia . This commentary,   steeped in artistic similes and beautifully discrete spears, brutally exposed   the evils of the current Florentine society and Roman Catholic Church like none   before. As a side effect, Divina Commedia planted a seed of restlessness   into the city of Florence that eventually effected Dante's political descendants   such as Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli, the city of Florence, and eventually would   affect great numbers of people throughout history. As a matter of fact, great   works of art by the legendary Salvador Dal&igrave; would not have been created,   the popular interpretation of hell even in 1998 would not be the same, and Niccol&ograve;   Machiavelli would not have documented his thoughts to write his legendary book,   The Prince without Dante Alighieris contribution to his writing, intellect   and controversial views. Alighieri had the vision to write a piece that would   directly effect his current society, as well as have strong repercussions even   today. Dante Alighieri and his Butterfly, the Divina Commedia , both have   had a gale force to be reckoned with.   Dante Alighieri's life was influenced not unlike most during   his time; it was greatly influenced by the existence of the Roman Catholic Church   as it was arguably the single most influential institution in the world since   its onset in approximately 30 A.D. During the time of Dante Alighieri however,   the church was the major force in politics, economics, and society. As Dantes   life matured, and he found himself in the service of religious officers who   figuratively and literally cut each other's throats to gain status. This succeeded   in shaping his negative view of the church as an organization. As Dantes life   led him into the realm of politics, and through his political service Boniface   VIII, Dante was able to get a first hand view of how the church was effectively   able to manipulate political and socioeconomic situations, and how his society   was affected negatively by the church officers desire for status and power.   One of the most outspoken believers in the separation of church and state, Alighieri,   now disillusioned with the church as well as Italys political situation, created   an effective weapon to expose the affairs at hand as well as shape the view   of a whole society. His weapon wasnt forged at the stone with fire and iron;   instead his weapon was his poetry; La Divina Commedia-phrased in the literary   structure known as terza rima.   Durante Alighiero known to us as Dante Alighieri was born of   a Guelph family in the spring of 1265 in Florence, Italy. His family was modestly   noble. This enabled Dante to become politically active in Florence, but not   to the point of being immune from exile. Dante became active in a political   dispute between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, who were fighting for control   of Florence. A political faction of the Guelphs which did not hold much favor   for Dante, eventually won control of Florence in 1302 and exiled him; later   with the promise of death if he should return. Dante relied on the goodwill   of others upon his exile, and started to draft the Commedia which exactly   this by Dante because it has a happy ending. Later it was dubbed the Divina   Commedia , not by Dante, but by his readers years after his death. Dante   worked on the Commedia from 1308 to 1321; he completed the work very   near his death.   It would be logical to worry about ones own personal safety   when writing such a book filled with personal criticisms (in Dantes example,   it was seemingly viewed as an expos&eacute;), whether it be versed in similes   or not.   Even in our modern global society there remains a prime example   for this possibility. In 1988, a man named Salman Rushdie wrote a fiction book   called Satanic Verses; a publication which was subsequently banned in India   and Ayatollah Khomeini declared a fatwah against Rushdie, offering millions   for his death. Even in 1998, it hasnt been forgotten.        For nearly a decade, Salman Rushdie has been a symbol of    freedom of speech under attack. But last week, the author celebrated the    apparent end of \"a dreadful terrorist threat.\" Iran's foreign minister,    Kamal Kharrazi, declared that Iran has \"no intention, nor is it going to    take any action whatsoever, to threaten the life of the author of The Satanic    Verses,\" the 1988 novel in which Rushdie allegedly blasphemed Islam.    Yet there was reason for caution. In 1989, the late Ayatollah    Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic edict, condemning Rushdie to    death. Technically it remains in effect, because Iranian officials say they    cannot reverse a religious ruling by Khomeini. An Iranian foundation also    continues to offer a $2.5 million bounty on Rushdie's head, and Iranian    hard-liners who dislike the current government's modest opening to the West    still want to see Rushdie dead. (www2.usnews.com/usnews/issue/981005/5rush.htm)     Why would Dantes Alighieri risk putting himself in this position   at a time that was notorious for its harsh methods of punishment? Simply put,   he didnt. There are many reasons why Dante was not daunted by society when   writing La Divina Commedia .   Dante was already well known by the academe and the politicos   for his writings. He had already published Vita Nuova which was a libello ,   or a small book of poetry which expressed his love for Beatrice and his struggle   with her death. He had also published other works as the Convivio , written   upon his exile. Later, he wrote a book called De Vulgari Eloquentia .   Even though this book was written in Latin, it discussed the need for one common   poetry language and made a proposal against Latin. Dante's experience in language   and history was certainly made apparent in this work as he analyzed many different   languages and made his argument for a combination of the best qualities of the   fourteen to seventeen Italian dialects and approximately 30 sub-dialects he   encountered in his travels. The book argues his case against Latin with quite   a bit of reasoning. To this day, Dante Alighieri is known as the \"Father of   the Modern Italian Language\" for his writing and efforts to put into use one   common language.   A second reason Alighieri would possibly not feel worried about   writing La Divina Commedia is that he was already exiled from his beloved   city of Florence. In his next writing called the Convivio , he writes   to cleanse his reputation and to establish a view that he feels people should   have of him. This writing takes place during the time when he   struggled desperately to become a citizen of Florence once   again. He soon came to the realization that he was not returning to Florence.   It is clear that La Divina Commedia   was demeaning to powers that encompass all of Italy, but Dante   didnt have a reason to be concerned as his exile from Florence was an almost   fatal blow to his hope and pride. It is likely that many of us would develop   a \"nothing to lose\" attitude in a situation where we have suffered losses of   extreme proportions. He did not have much of what he desired; furthermore, he   did not have the ability to recoup his losses. The love of his life Beatrice   had been dead for years now and he was permanently exiled from his place of   birth and source of great pride, Florence.   Upon his exile, Dante relied upon benefactors that offered   to take the responsibility of supporting him with food, shelter, and money.   One rarely receives \"something for nothing\" as the saying goes and Dante was   certainly aware that he would be providing some sort of retribution for this   honor of being supported. His benefactors anxiously awaited his new writing;   sometimes Dante had to force them to wait for the completion of his works.   In a performance recently given at Synchronicity Space on October   24 th , 1998 in Manhattan called The Dante Project: Inferno, there   is a specific scene in which one of Dantes benefactors almost forces him to   reveal his unfinished transcript. After some argument, the benefactor gives   up, but insists that Dante \"at least\" is expected to show up for dinner to entertain   him with intellectual conversation.   Another reason that Dante's Commedia did not have the   amount of negative repercussions as it could have simply because of expectation.   After the sum total of his bitter experiences, it was only logical at the time   to assume that upon his terminal exile from Florence, and his bittering stance   on the political and religious institutions of Italy during his time, he would   probably not be writing a piece without complaints and poetic retribution.   Finally, Dante Alighieri if anything else had one immovable   ally on his side; his fervent belief in pre-ordination. If Dante had the volition   to write anything, and did, he believed it was his place in destiny to do so,   and to suffer the repercussions was simply living his life as God would want   it. His belief in pre-ordination has been documented in many publications throughout   history.   Needless to say, such a controversial poem written by a man   who was well respected may have an influence on the thinking or philosophy of   others. One of the more obscure and profound cases of Dante's influence can   be found in the study of Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli who is best known today   for his book Il Principe , or The Prince .   Alighieri and Machiavelli's lives have quite a bit in common.   Both were born in Florence (Alighieri in 1265 and Machiavelli in 1469), both   came from families that were fairly noble. Both men were eventually exiled from   Florence due to political controversies. They would both would live out their   lives as scholars, philosophers, and prolific writers, and pass on approximately   the same age.   While Dante studied Aquinas, Virgil, and the ancient Greeks,   Machiavelli studied Petrarch and Dante Alighieri. It is not an easy task to   find any substantial and direct evidence of Dante's influence on Niccol&ograve;'s   philosophy. There is no clear and direct evidence of this influence in Machiavelli's   books. Machiavelli was, however, a prolific author of personal and business   letters. There is quite an exceptional indication of Dante's influence on the   life and philosophy of Niccol&ograve; in the letters he wrote to his confidants   and colleagues.   In a letter written by Machiavelli to his confidant Francesco   Guicciardini on December 19 th , 1525, Machiavelli is encouraging his   friend to seek financial aid from the Pope to marry off his daughters. Machiavelli's   main theme of his letter is a story in which Romeo gives advice to the Duke   of Provence urging him to make a distinguished marriage for the eldest daughter,   and other successful marriages will follow. Machiavelli used quotes from Dante   to seemingly legitimatize his statements.        In short, I would try the pope just the same, and even    if I came up short in the first rime around, I would talk about my aim in    general terms, beg him to help me with it, find out where he would stand,    and proceed directly or hang back-depending on how it went. I remind you    of the advice that Romeo gave to the duke of Provence, who had four daughters;    he urged him to make a distinguished marriage for the eldest, pointing out    that she would provide an example and precedent for the rest. So, he married    her to the King of France, and gave him half of Provence as a dowry. Once    he did this, he married the others off to three kings; as Dante says:    He had four daughters, each a queen;    The cause of all this was Romeo    A pilgrim and of humble birth. &#9;(Alighieri, Paradiso    VI 133-135)    &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(Atkinson, Sices 372)     &#9;This is simply a brief except to establish that Dante was   an influence in Machiavelli's life, and this is not a completely unknown fact.   What is not common knowledge is the extent to which Dante influenced the life   of Machiavelli. &#9;Machiavelli   is best known to the world by his book called The Prince .   The Prince is a quasi handbook for the acquisition and maintenance of   Principalities. It has made Machiavelli quite infamous as a villain (although   a dedicated study of Machiavelli reveals his immorality as grossly overstated)   and as a politician/philosopher. The Prince was not completely written   under the name of Il Principe/The Prince . It had its beginnings as a   short study called De Principatibus . De Principatibus became the   first ten chapters of The Prince . In Machiavelli's own words, he stated   that without Dante Alighieri, De Principatibus and subsequently, The   Prince would not have been written.        When evening comes, I return home and enter my study; on    the threshold I take off my workday clothes covered with mud and dirt, and    put on the garments of court and palace. Fitted out appropriately, I step    inside the venerable courts of the ancients, where, solicitously received    by them, I nourish myself on that food that is alone mine and for    which I was born; where I am unashamed to converse with them and to question    them about the motives for their actions, and they, out of their human kindness,    answer me. And for hours at a time, I feel no boredom, I forget all of my    troubles, I do not dread poverty, and I am not terrified by death. I absorb    myself into them completely. And because Dante says that no one understands    anything unless he retains what he has understood, I have jotted down what    I have profited from in their conversations and composed a short study,    De Principatibus , in which I delve as deeply as I can into the ideas    concerning this topic, discussing the definition of a princedom, the categories    of princedoms, how they are acquired, how they are retained, and why they    are lost (Atkinson, Sices 264)     &#9;In Machiavelli's own words, he has stated that the ideas   to create De Principatibus , the beginnings of The Prince , were   derived and documented from his \"discourses\" with the ancients (one being Dante   Alighieri) and that he undertook this project with the motivation that Dante   said that \"No one understand anything unless he retains what he has understood.\"   After Machiavelli's death, a revised version of De   Principatibus was published as Il Principe ,   The Prince . As an aside, so much is believed and so little is actually   known of Machiavelli's motivations for writing The Prince. It is said to have   been originally written to appease the Dei Medici Family and allow him entrance   back into Florence. Actually, in the same letter cited above, Machiavelli states   that De Principatibus is to be dedicated to a man stated as His Magnificence   Giuliano which was Giuliano, duke of Nemours. Giuliano was not very interested   in Machiavelli's writing. He also died on March 17, 1516. It was then dedicated   to Lorenzo II Dei Medici who became duke of Urbino later the same year on October   8 th .        It ought to be welcomed by a prince, and especially a new    prince; therefore I am dedicating it to His Magnificence Giuliano (Atkinson,    Sices 264)     From Machiavelli to his Magnificence Giuliano, we can find   in many societies some kind of connection to or influence of Dante Alighieri.   In his death, Dante had the honor of influencing and inspiring great legends   in politics, philosophy and the arts. Salvador Dal&igrave; is an artist of legendary   proportion and needs no introduction. Dal&igrave; was commissioned by the Italian   government to create illustrations for La Divina Commedia in 1951. The   illustrations would be in commemoration of the 700 th year anniversary   of Dante's birth. Dal&igrave; was however, quite controversial as an artist   at the time. The Italians, by nature tend to be a nationalistic group of people.   There was a large faction of Italian people who opposed Dante's commemoration   to be done by a Spaniard. The commission was soon rescinded; however; Dal&igrave;   was greatly affected by La Divina Commedia and proceeded to create 100   interpretive illustrations. He created 34 illustrations for Dantes Inferno,   33 for Dante's Purgatorio and another 33 for the Paradiso - one can only imagine   what force a writing has when it inspired one of historys most sought after   artists works; and so many of them! Every one of Dal&igrave;s works has (a)   specific Canto(s) in which it was inspired. Dal&igrave; as well as his work   have been an inspiration and influential force in the world. When once asked   about Dante Alighieri, Dal&igrave; said he was fascinated by \"his angelic vision   of being and cosmic side of God; incomprehensible for man, and reflected in   the mirror of the face of the angel\". (Generalitat de Catalunya 50) It is obvious   why La Divina Commedia inspired such works of art as it truly is a breakthrough   in terms of creating visions with words. It carries within its words the power   of vivid imagery. The method in which Alighieri used his verse to make the reader   see all that he is experiencing is that of a master. His verses have the power   to make one cry for joy in Paradiso as well as writhe in horror during his descent   through the depths of hell.   tal, non per foco, ma per divin'arte,   bollia l&agrave; giuso una pegola spessa,   che 'nviscava la ripa d'ogne parte.   I' vedea lei, ma non vedea in essa   mai che le bolle che 'l bollor levava,   e gonfiar tutta, e riseder compressa   che, per veder, non indugia 'l partire:   e vidi dietro a noi un diavol nero   correndo su per lo scoglio venire.   Ahi quant'elli era ne l'aspetto fero!   e quanto mi parea ne l'atto acerbo,   con l'ali aperte e sovra i pi&egrave; leggero!   L'omero suo, ch'era aguto e superbo,   carcava un peccator con ambo l'anche,   e quei tenea de' pi&egrave; ghermito 'l nerbo   so, not by fire but by the art of God,   below there boiled a thick and tarry mass   that covered all the banks with clamminess.   I saw it, but I could not see within it;   no thing was visible but boiling bubbles,   the swelling of the pitch; and then it settled   who does not stop his flight and yet would look.   And then in back of us I saw a black   demon as he came racing up the crags.   Ah, he was surely barbarous to see!   And how relentless seemed to me his acts!   His wings were open and his feet were lithe;   across his shoulder, which was sharp and high,   he had slung a sinner, upward from the thighs;   in front, the demon gripped him by the ankles   He threw the sinner down, then wheeled along   The stony cliff: no mastiff's ever been   unleashed with so much haste to chase a thief.   The sinner plunged, then surfaced, black with pitch;   but now the demons, from beneath the bridge,   shouted: \"The Sacred Face has no place here;   here we swim differently than in the Serchio;   if you don't want to feel our grappling hooks,   don't try to lift yourself above that ditch.\"   They pricked him with a hundred prongs and more,   then taunted: \"Here one dances under cover,   so try to grab your secret graft below.\"   The demons did the same as any cook   who has his urchins force the meat with hooks   deep down into the pot, that it not float.   (Alighieri/Mandelbaum 187-188)       It is to no surprise that even in modern media, Dantes hell   is used as a template. The movie released only this year, What Dreams May   Come is about a man (Robin Williams) who dies in a car accident and goes   to heaven, which takes the form of his personal paradise. He joins his children   in heaven as they had already been killed in a previous car accident. His wife   (Annabella Sciorra) is struggling to keep hope up as she feel she has nothing   to live for. She gives up hope, commits suicide, and consequently goes to hell   (the same fate she would suffer in the La Divina Commedia ). Williams   defies her fate, and out of true love for his wife, travels through the depths   of hell to find her. In his journey through hell, he comes upon a land in which   sinners are buried up to their necks in soil and the dust blinds some of the   sinners eyes. As he tries to walk on this ground comprised of suffering humans,   he accidentally steps on them and they yell out in pain and ask the question,   \"Why are you walking on me?\" Williams, upon the pleading of an old man, clears   his eyes of the dust, and a dialogue ensues.   This scene is an almost exact re-creation of Dantes Ptolomea;   the ninth circle of hell, third ring where the sinners are buried up to their   heads in ice (not soil), and their eyes are frozen shut by the tears they shed.   The text in Divina Commedia portrays a similar scenario, and the influence   of this movie is clearly of Alighieri.   Oh sovra tutte mal creata plebe   che stai nel loco onde parlare &egrave; duro,   mei foste state qui pecore o zebe!   Come noi fummo gi&ugrave; nel pozzo scuro   sotto i pi&egrave; del gigante assai pi&ugrave; bassi,   e io mirava ancora a l'alto muro,   dicere udi'mi: Guarda come passi:   va s&igrave;, che tu non calchi con le piante   le teste de' fratei miseri lassi.   E un de' tristi de la fredda   crosta grid&ograve; a noi: O anime crudeli   tanto che data v'&egrave; l'ultima posta,   levatemi dal viso i duri veli,   s&igrave; ch'io sfoghi 'l duol che 'l cor m'impregna,   un poco, pria che 'l pianto si raggeli.   Per ch'io a lui: Se vuo' ch'i' ti sovvegna,   dimmi chi se', e s'io non ti disbrigo,   al fondo de la ghiaccia ir mi convegna   O rabble ill-begotten above all,   Who're in the place to speak of which is hard,   'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats !   When we were down within the darksome well,   Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,   And I was scanning still the lofty wall,   heard it said to me: \"Look how thou steppest I   Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet   The heads of the tired, miserable brothers !\"   And one of the wretches of the frozen crust   Cried out to us: \"O souls so merciless   That the last post is given unto you,   Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I   May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart   A little, e'er the weeping recongeal.\"   Whence I to him: \"If thou wouldst have me help thee   Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,   May I go to the bottom of the ice.\"   (Alighieri/Mandelbaum 293,307)       For hundreds of years, Dante Alighieri's love for his art of   writing and his creation Divina Commedia have been an inspiration to   thousands of scholars, scientists, artists and philosophers around the world.   A creation of love that has affected and will continue to compel thousands,   is not done justice by a simple analysis. Although it is our right to judge   upon our knowledge of Alighieri to make a character analysis, it would take   a number of lifetimes to be able to understand and fully appreciate Alighieri's   life and works. Let the man who made his belief in the failure of words clear   throughout the Divina Commedia , let him speak now in his own words as   an example of the writing that has profoundly affected generations.   Bernardo m'accennava, e sorridea,   perch'io guardassi suso; ma io era   gi&agrave; per me stesso tal qual ei volea:   ch&eacute; la mia vista, venendo sincera,   e pi&ugrave; e pi&ugrave; intrava per lo raggio   de l'alta luce che da s&eacute; &egrave; vera   Da quinci innanzi il mio veder fu maggio   che 'l parlar mostra, ch'a tal vista cede,   e cede la memoria a tanto oltraggio.   Qual &egrave; colui che sognando vede,   che dopo 'l sogno la passione impressa   rimane, e l'altro a la mente non riede,   cotal son io, ch&eacute; quasi tutta cessa   mia visione, e ancor mi distilla   nel core il dolce che nacque da essa.   Cos&igrave; la neve al sol si disigilla;   cos&igrave; al vento ne le foglie levi   si perdea la sentenza di Sibilla.   O somma luce che tanto ti levi   da' concetti mortali, a la mia mente   ripresta un poco di quel che parevi,   e fa la lingua mia tanto possente,   ch'una favilla sol de la tua gloria   possa lasciare a la futura gente;   ch&eacute;, per tornare alquanto a mia memoria   e per sonare un poco in questi versi,   pi&ugrave; si conceper&agrave; di tua vittoria.   (Alighieri/Vandelli 917-918)     Bernard indicated to me, and smiled,   for me to look above; but I was   already for myself doing the same as which he wanted   that my sight, becoming clearer,   and more and more (able to glimpse into) the beam   of the (exalted) light that itself is real   From then on, what I saw was greater   than the \"spoken word\" can express, at such a sight surrenders,   the memory when faced with such (divine) excess.   It is like that of he who dreaming sees,   that after the dream's passion imprinted,   remains, and the rest the mind cannot rebuild,   such am I, that almost completely fades   my vision, and yet it still distills   in (my) heart the sweetness that was born from it.   Like this the snow under the sun thaws   like this the wind lifts the leaves   (and) is lost the saying(s) of Sibyl   Oh supreme light that you are so far lifted   from mortal concepts , to my mind   give me again (even) a little of that which you appeared   and make my tongue so powerful,   that a glimmer of your glory   can be left to the future people;   that for returning (even) somewhat to my memory   and for echoing (even) a little in these verses,   it can be more understood - your victory.

{"detail": [{"content": "Dominique Liana Russo as Dante         Dominique Liana Russo   November 27, 1998       Self versus State: Fall Semester 1998       The Aftermath of Dante Alighieri: His Influence of Society from   Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli to Robin Williams         In China it is believed that the slight breeze from the movement   of a butterflys wing may result in a torrential hurricane in the west. This   ancient belief attests to the existence of what we know as a chain reaction,   and the consequences it is capable of in nature, or in our particular case study,   an established society. In the year 1308, the butterfly became restless once   again with the publication of Dantes Divina Commedia . This commentary,   steeped in artistic similes and beautifully discrete spears, brutally exposed   the evils of the current Florentine society and Roman Catholic Church like none   before. As a side effect, Divina Commedia planted a seed of restlessness   into the city of Florence that eventually effected Dante's political descendants   such as Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli, the city of Florence, and eventually would   affect great numbers of people throughout history. As a matter of fact, great   works of art by the legendary Salvador Dal&igrave; would not have been created,   the popular interpretation of hell even in 1998 would not be the same, and Niccol&ograve;   Machiavelli would not have documented his thoughts to write his legendary book,   The Prince without Dante Alighieris contribution to his writing, intellect   and controversial views. Alighieri had the vision to write a piece that would   directly effect his current society, as well as have strong repercussions even   today. Dante Alighieri and his Butterfly, the Divina Commedia , both have   had a gale force to be reckoned with.   Dante Alighieri's life was influenced not unlike most during   his time; it was greatly influenced by the existence of the Roman Catholic Church   as it was arguably the single most influential institution in the world since   its onset in approximately 30 A.D. During the time of Dante Alighieri however,   the church was the major force in politics, economics, and society. As Dantes   life matured, and he found himself in the service of religious officers who   figuratively and literally cut each other's throats to gain status. This succeeded   in shaping his negative view of the church as an organization. As Dantes life   led him into the realm of politics, and through his political service Boniface   VIII, Dante was able to get a first hand view of how the church was effectively   able to manipulate political and socioeconomic situations, and how his society   was affected negatively by the church officers desire for status and power.   One of the most outspoken believers in the separation of church and state, Alighieri,   now disillusioned with the church as well as Italys political situation, created   an effective weapon to expose the affairs at hand as well as shape the view   of a whole society. His weapon wasnt forged at the stone with fire and iron;   instead his weapon was his poetry; La Divina Commedia-phrased in the literary   structure known as terza rima.   Durante Alighiero known to us as Dante Alighieri was born of   a Guelph family in the spring of 1265 in Florence, Italy. His family was modestly   noble. This enabled Dante to become politically active in Florence, but not   to the point of being immune from exile. Dante became active in a political   dispute between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, who were fighting for control   of Florence. A political faction of the Guelphs which did not hold much favor   for Dante, eventually won control of Florence in 1302 and exiled him; later   with the promise of death if he should return. Dante relied on the goodwill   of others upon his exile, and started to draft the Commedia which exactly   this by Dante because it has a happy ending. Later it was dubbed the Divina   Commedia , not by Dante, but by his readers years after his death. Dante   worked on the Commedia from 1308 to 1321; he completed the work very   near his death.   It would be logical to worry about ones own personal safety   when writing such a book filled with personal criticisms (in Dantes example,   it was seemingly viewed as an expos&eacute;), whether it be versed in similes   or not.   Even in our modern global society there remains a prime example   for this possibility. In 1988, a man named Salman Rushdie wrote a fiction book   called Satanic Verses; a publication which was subsequently banned in India   and Ayatollah Khomeini declared a fatwah against Rushdie, offering millions   for his death. Even in 1998, it hasnt been forgotten.        For nearly a decade, Salman Rushdie has been a symbol of    freedom of speech under attack. But last week, the author celebrated the    apparent end of \"a dreadful terrorist threat.\" Iran's foreign minister,    Kamal Kharrazi, declared that Iran has \"no intention, nor is it going to    take any action whatsoever, to threaten the life of the author of The Satanic    Verses,\" the 1988 novel in which Rushdie allegedly blasphemed Islam.    Yet there was reason for caution. In 1989, the late Ayatollah    Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic edict, condemning Rushdie to    death. Technically it remains in effect, because Iranian officials say they    cannot reverse a religious ruling by Khomeini. An Iranian foundation also    continues to offer a $2.5 million bounty on Rushdie's head, and Iranian    hard-liners who dislike the current government's modest opening to the West    still want to see Rushdie dead. (www2.usnews.com/usnews/issue/981005/5rush.htm)     Why would Dantes Alighieri risk putting himself in this position   at a time that was notorious for its harsh methods of punishment? Simply put,   he didnt. There are many reasons why Dante was not daunted by society when   writing La Divina Commedia .   Dante was already well known by the academe and the politicos   for his writings. He had already published Vita Nuova which was a libello ,   or a small book of poetry which expressed his love for Beatrice and his struggle   with her death. He had also published other works as the Convivio , written   upon his exile. Later, he wrote a book called De Vulgari Eloquentia .   Even though this book was written in Latin, it discussed the need for one common   poetry language and made a proposal against Latin. Dante's experience in language   and history was certainly made apparent in this work as he analyzed many different   languages and made his argument for a combination of the best qualities of the   fourteen to seventeen Italian dialects and approximately 30 sub-dialects he   encountered in his travels. The book argues his case against Latin with quite   a bit of reasoning. To this day, Dante Alighieri is known as the \"Father of   the Modern Italian Language\" for his writing and efforts to put into use one   common language.   A second reason Alighieri would possibly not feel worried about   writing La Divina Commedia is that he was already exiled from his beloved   city of Florence. In his next writing called the Convivio , he writes   to cleanse his reputation and to establish a view that he feels people should   have of him. This writing takes place during the time when he   struggled desperately to become a citizen of Florence once   again. He soon came to the realization that he was not returning to Florence.   It is clear that La Divina Commedia   was demeaning to powers that encompass all of Italy, but Dante   didnt have a reason to be concerned as his exile from Florence was an almost   fatal blow to his hope and pride. It is likely that many of us would develop   a \"nothing to lose\" attitude in a situation where we have suffered losses of   extreme proportions. He did not have much of what he desired; furthermore, he   did not have the ability to recoup his losses. The love of his life Beatrice   had been dead for years now and he was permanently exiled from his place of   birth and source of great pride, Florence.   Upon his exile, Dante relied upon benefactors that offered   to take the responsibility of supporting him with food, shelter, and money.   One rarely receives \"something for nothing\" as the saying goes and Dante was   certainly aware that he would be providing some sort of retribution for this   honor of being supported. His benefactors anxiously awaited his new writing;   sometimes Dante had to force them to wait for the completion of his works.   In a performance recently given at Synchronicity Space on October   24 th , 1998 in Manhattan called The Dante Project: Inferno, there   is a specific scene in which one of Dantes benefactors almost forces him to   reveal his unfinished transcript. After some argument, the benefactor gives   up, but insists that Dante \"at least\" is expected to show up for dinner to entertain   him with intellectual conversation.   Another reason that Dante's Commedia did not have the   amount of negative repercussions as it could have simply because of expectation.   After the sum total of his bitter experiences, it was only logical at the time   to assume that upon his terminal exile from Florence, and his bittering stance   on the political and religious institutions of Italy during his time, he would   probably not be writing a piece without complaints and poetic retribution.   Finally, Dante Alighieri if anything else had one immovable   ally on his side; his fervent belief in pre-ordination. If Dante had the volition   to write anything, and did, he believed it was his place in destiny to do so,   and to suffer the repercussions was simply living his life as God would want   it. His belief in pre-ordination has been documented in many publications throughout   history.   Needless to say, such a controversial poem written by a man   who was well respected may have an influence on the thinking or philosophy of   others. One of the more obscure and profound cases of Dante's influence can   be found in the study of Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli who is best known today   for his book Il Principe , or The Prince .   Alighieri and Machiavelli's lives have quite a bit in common.   Both were born in Florence (Alighieri in 1265 and Machiavelli in 1469), both   came from families that were fairly noble. Both men were eventually exiled from   Florence due to political controversies. They would both would live out their   lives as scholars, philosophers, and prolific writers, and pass on approximately   the same age.   While Dante studied Aquinas, Virgil, and the ancient Greeks,   Machiavelli studied Petrarch and Dante Alighieri. It is not an easy task to   find any substantial and direct evidence of Dante's influence on Niccol&ograve;'s   philosophy. There is no clear and direct evidence of this influence in Machiavelli's   books. Machiavelli was, however, a prolific author of personal and business   letters. There is quite an exceptional indication of Dante's influence on the   life and philosophy of Niccol&ograve; in the letters he wrote to his confidants   and colleagues.   In a letter written by Machiavelli to his confidant Francesco   Guicciardini on December 19 th , 1525, Machiavelli is encouraging his   friend to seek financial aid from the Pope to marry off his daughters. Machiavelli's   main theme of his letter is a story in which Romeo gives advice to the Duke   of Provence urging him to make a distinguished marriage for the eldest daughter,   and other successful marriages will follow. Machiavelli used quotes from Dante   to seemingly legitimatize his statements.        In short, I would try the pope just the same, and even    if I came up short in the first rime around, I would talk about my aim in    general terms, beg him to help me with it, find out where he would stand,    and proceed directly or hang back-depending on how it went. I remind you    of the advice that Romeo gave to the duke of Provence, who had four daughters;    he urged him to make a distinguished marriage for the eldest, pointing out    that she would provide an example and precedent for the rest. So, he married    her to the King of France, and gave him half of Provence as a dowry. Once    he did this, he married the others off to three kings; as Dante says:    He had four daughters, each a queen;    The cause of all this was Romeo    A pilgrim and of humble birth. &#9;(Alighieri, Paradiso    VI 133-135)    &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(Atkinson, Sices 372)     &#9;This is simply a brief except to establish that Dante was   an influence in Machiavelli's life, and this is not a completely unknown fact.   What is not common knowledge is the extent to which Dante influenced the life   of Machiavelli. &#9;Machiavelli   is best known to the world by his book called The Prince .   The Prince is a quasi handbook for the acquisition and maintenance of   Principalities. It has made Machiavelli quite infamous as a villain (although   a dedicated study of Machiavelli reveals his immorality as grossly overstated)   and as a politician/philosopher. The Prince was not completely written   under the name of Il Principe/The Prince . It had its beginnings as a   short study called De Principatibus . De Principatibus became the   first ten chapters of The Prince . In Machiavelli's own words, he stated   that without Dante Alighieri, De Principatibus and subsequently, The   Prince would not have been written.        When evening comes, I return home and enter my study; on    the threshold I take off my workday clothes covered with mud and dirt, and    put on the garments of court and palace. Fitted out appropriately, I step    inside the venerable courts of the ancients, where, solicitously received    by them, I nourish myself on that food that is alone mine and for    which I was born; where I am unashamed to converse with them and to question    them about the motives for their actions, and they, out of their human kindness,    answer me. And for hours at a time, I feel no boredom, I forget all of my    troubles, I do not dread poverty, and I am not terrified by death. I absorb    myself into them completely. And because Dante says that no one understands    anything unless he retains what he has understood, I have jotted down what    I have profited from in their conversations and composed a short study,    De Principatibus , in which I delve as deeply as I can into the ideas    concerning this topic, discussing the definition of a princedom, the categories    of princedoms, how they are acquired, how they are retained, and why they    are lost (Atkinson, Sices 264)     &#9;In Machiavelli's own words, he has stated that the ideas   to create De Principatibus , the beginnings of The Prince , were   derived and documented from his \"discourses\" with the ancients (one being Dante   Alighieri) and that he undertook this project with the motivation that Dante   said that \"No one understand anything unless he retains what he has understood.\"   After Machiavelli's death, a revised version of De   Principatibus was published as Il Principe ,   The Prince . As an aside, so much is believed and so little is actually   known of Machiavelli's motivations for writing The Prince. It is said to have   been originally written to appease the Dei Medici Family and allow him entrance   back into Florence. Actually, in the same letter cited above, Machiavelli states   that De Principatibus is to be dedicated to a man stated as His Magnificence   Giuliano which was Giuliano, duke of Nemours. Giuliano was not very interested   in Machiavelli's writing. He also died on March 17, 1516. It was then dedicated   to Lorenzo II Dei Medici who became duke of Urbino later the same year on October   8 th .        It ought to be welcomed by a prince, and especially a new    prince; therefore I am dedicating it to His Magnificence Giuliano (Atkinson,    Sices 264)     From Machiavelli to his Magnificence Giuliano, we can find   in many societies some kind of connection to or influence of Dante Alighieri.   In his death, Dante had the honor of influencing and inspiring great legends   in politics, philosophy and the arts. Salvador Dal&igrave; is an artist of legendary   proportion and needs no introduction. Dal&igrave; was commissioned by the Italian   government to create illustrations for La Divina Commedia in 1951. The   illustrations would be in commemoration of the 700 th year anniversary   of Dante's birth. Dal&igrave; was however, quite controversial as an artist   at the time. The Italians, by nature tend to be a nationalistic group of people.   There was a large faction of Italian people who opposed Dante's commemoration   to be done by a Spaniard. The commission was soon rescinded; however; Dal&igrave;   was greatly affected by La Divina Commedia and proceeded to create 100   interpretive illustrations. He created 34 illustrations for Dantes Inferno,   33 for Dante's Purgatorio and another 33 for the Paradiso - one can only imagine   what force a writing has when it inspired one of historys most sought after   artists works; and so many of them! Every one of Dal&igrave;s works has (a)   specific Canto(s) in which it was inspired. Dal&igrave; as well as his work   have been an inspiration and influential force in the world. When once asked   about Dante Alighieri, Dal&igrave; said he was fascinated by \"his angelic vision   of being and cosmic side of God; incomprehensible for man, and reflected in   the mirror of the face of the angel\". (Generalitat de Catalunya 50) It is obvious   why La Divina Commedia inspired such works of art as it truly is a breakthrough   in terms of creating visions with words. It carries within its words the power   of vivid imagery. The method in which Alighieri used his verse to make the reader   see all that he is experiencing is that of a master. His verses have the power   to make one cry for joy in Paradiso as well as writhe in horror during his descent   through the depths of hell.   tal, non per foco, ma per divin'arte,   bollia l&agrave; giuso una pegola spessa,   che 'nviscava la ripa d'ogne parte.   I' vedea lei, ma non vedea in essa   mai che le bolle che 'l bollor levava,   e gonfiar tutta, e riseder compressa   che, per veder, non indugia 'l partire:   e vidi dietro a noi un diavol nero   correndo su per lo scoglio venire.   Ahi quant'elli era ne l'aspetto fero!   e quanto mi parea ne l'atto acerbo,   con l'ali aperte e sovra i pi&egrave; leggero!   L'omero suo, ch'era aguto e superbo,   carcava un peccator con ambo l'anche,   e quei tenea de' pi&egrave; ghermito 'l nerbo   so, not by fire but by the art of God,   below there boiled a thick and tarry mass   that covered all the banks with clamminess.   I saw it, but I could not see within it;   no thing was visible but boiling bubbles,   the swelling of the pitch; and then it settled   who does not stop his flight and yet would look.   And then in back of us I saw a black   demon as he came racing up the crags.   Ah, he was surely barbarous to see!   And how relentless seemed to me his acts!   His wings were open and his feet were lithe;   across his shoulder, which was sharp and high,   he had slung a sinner, upward from the thighs;   in front, the demon gripped him by the ankles   He threw the sinner down, then wheeled along   The stony cliff: no mastiff's ever been   unleashed with so much haste to chase a thief.   The sinner plunged, then surfaced, black with pitch;   but now the demons, from beneath the bridge,   shouted: \"The Sacred Face has no place here;   here we swim differently than in the Serchio;   if you don't want to feel our grappling hooks,   don't try to lift yourself above that ditch.\"   They pricked him with a hundred prongs and more,   then taunted: \"Here one dances under cover,   so try to grab your secret graft below.\"   The demons did the same as any cook   who has his urchins force the meat with hooks   deep down into the pot, that it not float.   (Alighieri/Mandelbaum 187-188)       It is to no surprise that even in modern media, Dantes hell   is used as a template. The movie released only this year, What Dreams May   Come is about a man (Robin Williams) who dies in a car accident and goes   to heaven, which takes the form of his personal paradise. He joins his children   in heaven as they had already been killed in a previous car accident. His wife   (Annabella Sciorra) is struggling to keep hope up as she feel she has nothing   to live for. She gives up hope, commits suicide, and consequently goes to hell   (the same fate she would suffer in the La Divina Commedia ). Williams   defies her fate, and out of true love for his wife, travels through the depths   of hell to find her. In his journey through hell, he comes upon a land in which   sinners are buried up to their necks in soil and the dust blinds some of the   sinners eyes. As he tries to walk on this ground comprised of suffering humans,   he accidentally steps on them and they yell out in pain and ask the question,   \"Why are you walking on me?\" Williams, upon the pleading of an old man, clears   his eyes of the dust, and a dialogue ensues.   This scene is an almost exact re-creation of Dantes Ptolomea;   the ninth circle of hell, third ring where the sinners are buried up to their   heads in ice (not soil), and their eyes are frozen shut by the tears they shed.   The text in Divina Commedia portrays a similar scenario, and the influence   of this movie is clearly of Alighieri.   Oh sovra tutte mal creata plebe   che stai nel loco onde parlare &egrave; duro,   mei foste state qui pecore o zebe!   Come noi fummo gi&ugrave; nel pozzo scuro   sotto i pi&egrave; del gigante assai pi&ugrave; bassi,   e io mirava ancora a l'alto muro,   dicere udi'mi: Guarda come passi:   va s&igrave;, che tu non calchi con le piante   le teste de' fratei miseri lassi.   E un de' tristi de la fredda   crosta grid&ograve; a noi: O anime crudeli   tanto che data v'&egrave; l'ultima posta,   levatemi dal viso i duri veli,   s&igrave; ch'io sfoghi 'l duol che 'l cor m'impregna,   un poco, pria che 'l pianto si raggeli.   Per ch'io a lui: Se vuo' ch'i' ti sovvegna,   dimmi chi se', e s'io non ti disbrigo,   al fondo de la ghiaccia ir mi convegna   O rabble ill-begotten above all,   Who're in the place to speak of which is hard,   'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats !   When we were down within the darksome well,   Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,   And I was scanning still the lofty wall,   heard it said to me: \"Look how thou steppest I   Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet   The heads of the tired, miserable brothers !\"   And one of the wretches of the frozen crust   Cried out to us: \"O souls so merciless   That the last post is given unto you,   Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I   May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart   A little, e'er the weeping recongeal.\"   Whence I to him: \"If thou wouldst have me help thee   Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,   May I go to the bottom of the ice.\"   (Alighieri/Mandelbaum 293,307)       For hundreds of years, Dante Alighieri's love for his art of   writing and his creation Divina Commedia have been an inspiration to   thousands of scholars, scientists, artists and philosophers around the world.   A creation of love that has affected and will continue to compel thousands,   is not done justice by a simple analysis. Although it is our right to judge   upon our knowledge of Alighieri to make a character analysis, it would take   a number of lifetimes to be able to understand and fully appreciate Alighieri's   life and works. Let the man who made his belief in the failure of words clear   throughout the Divina Commedia , let him speak now in his own words as   an example of the writing that has profoundly affected generations.   Bernardo m'accennava, e sorridea,   perch'io guardassi suso; ma io era   gi&agrave; per me stesso tal qual ei volea:   ch&eacute; la mia vista, venendo sincera,   e pi&ugrave; e pi&ugrave; intrava per lo raggio   de l'alta luce che da s&eacute; &egrave; vera   Da quinci innanzi il mio veder fu maggio   che 'l parlar mostra, ch'a tal vista cede,   e cede la memoria a tanto oltraggio.   Qual &egrave; colui che sognando vede,   che dopo 'l sogno la passione impressa   rimane, e l'altro a la mente non riede,   cotal son io, ch&eacute; quasi tutta cessa   mia visione, e ancor mi distilla   nel core il dolce che nacque da essa.   Cos&igrave; la neve al sol si disigilla;   cos&igrave; al vento ne le foglie levi   si perdea la sentenza di Sibilla.   O somma luce che tanto ti levi   da' concetti mortali, a la mia mente   ripresta un poco di quel che parevi,   e fa la lingua mia tanto possente,   ch'una favilla sol de la tua gloria   possa lasciare a la futura gente;   ch&eacute;, per tornare alquanto a mia memoria   e per sonare un poco in questi versi,   pi&ugrave; si conceper&agrave; di tua vittoria.   (Alighieri/Vandelli 917-918)     Bernard indicated to me, and smiled,   for me to look above; but I was   already for myself doing the same as which he wanted   that my sight, becoming clearer,   and more and more (able to glimpse into) the beam   of the (exalted) light that itself is real   From then on, what I saw was greater   than the \"spoken word\" can express, at such a sight surrenders,   the memory when faced with such (divine) excess.   It is like that of he who dreaming sees,   that after the dream's passion imprinted,   remains, and the rest the mind cannot rebuild,   such am I, that almost completely fades   my vision, and yet it still distills   in (my) heart the sweetness that was born from it.   Like this the snow under the sun thaws   like this the wind lifts the leaves   (and) is lost the saying(s) of Sibyl   Oh supreme light that you are so far lifted   from mortal concepts , to my mind   give me again (even) a little of that which you appeared   and make my tongue so powerful,   that a glimmer of your glory   can be left to the future people;   that for returning (even) somewhat to my memory   and for echoing (even) a little in these verses,   it can be more understood - your victory.

{"detail": [{"content": "Dominique Liana Russo as Dante         Dominique Liana Russo   November 27, 1998       Self versus State: Fall Semester 1998       The Aftermath of Dante Alighieri: His Influence of Society from   Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli to Robin Williams         In China it is believed that the slight breeze from the movement   of a butterflys wing may result in a torrential hurricane in the west. This   ancient belief attests to the existence of what we know as a chain reaction,   and the consequences it is capable of in nature, or in our particular case study,   an established society. In the year 1308, the butterfly became restless once   again with the publication of Dantes Divina Commedia . This commentary,   steeped in artistic similes and beautifully discrete spears, brutally exposed   the evils of the current Florentine society and Roman Catholic Church like none   before. As a side effect, Divina Commedia planted a seed of restlessness   into the city of Florence that eventually effected Dante's political descendants   such as Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli, the city of Florence, and eventually would   affect great numbers of people throughout history. As a matter of fact, great   works of art by the legendary Salvador Dal&igrave; would not have been created,   the popular interpretation of hell even in 1998 would not be the same, and Niccol&ograve;   Machiavelli would not have documented his thoughts to write his legendary book,   The Prince without Dante Alighieris contribution to his writing, intellect   and controversial views. Alighieri had the vision to write a piece that would   directly effect his current society, as well as have strong repercussions even   today. Dante Alighieri and his Butterfly, the Divina Commedia , both have   had a gale force to be reckoned with.   Dante Alighieri's life was influenced not unlike most during   his time; it was greatly influenced by the existence of the Roman Catholic Church   as it was arguably the single most influential institution in the world since   its onset in approximately 30 A.D. During the time of Dante Alighieri however,   the church was the major force in politics, economics, and society. As Dantes   life matured, and he found himself in the service of religious officers who   figuratively and literally cut each other's throats to gain status. This succeeded   in shaping his negative view of the church as an organization. As Dantes life   led him into the realm of politics, and through his political service Boniface   VIII, Dante was able to get a first hand view of how the church was effectively   able to manipulate political and socioeconomic situations, and how his society   was affected negatively by the church officers desire for status and power.   One of the most outspoken believers in the separation of church and state, Alighieri,   now disillusioned with the church as well as Italys political situation, created   an effective weapon to expose the affairs at hand as well as shape the view   of a whole society. His weapon wasnt forged at the stone with fire and iron;   instead his weapon was his poetry; La Divina Commedia-phrased in the literary   structure known as terza rima.   Durante Alighiero known to us as Dante Alighieri was born of   a Guelph family in the spring of 1265 in Florence, Italy. His family was modestly   noble. This enabled Dante to become politically active in Florence, but not   to the point of being immune from exile. Dante became active in a political   dispute between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, who were fighting for control   of Florence. A political faction of the Guelphs which did not hold much favor   for Dante, eventually won control of Florence in 1302 and exiled him; later   with the promise of death if he should return. Dante relied on the goodwill   of others upon his exile, and started to draft the Commedia which exactly   this by Dante because it has a happy ending. Later it was dubbed the Divina   Commedia , not by Dante, but by his readers years after his death. Dante   worked on the Commedia from 1308 to 1321; he completed the work very   near his death.   It would be logical to worry about ones own personal safety   when writing such a book filled with personal criticisms (in Dantes example,   it was seemingly viewed as an expos&eacute;), whether it be versed in similes   or not.   Even in our modern global society there remains a prime example   for this possibility. In 1988, a man named Salman Rushdie wrote a fiction book   called Satanic Verses; a publication which was subsequently banned in India   and Ayatollah Khomeini declared a fatwah against Rushdie, offering millions   for his death. Even in 1998, it hasnt been forgotten.        For nearly a decade, Salman Rushdie has been a symbol of    freedom of speech under attack. But last week, the author celebrated the    apparent end of \"a dreadful terrorist threat.\" Iran's foreign minister,    Kamal Kharrazi, declared that Iran has \"no intention, nor is it going to    take any action whatsoever, to threaten the life of the author of The Satanic    Verses,\" the 1988 novel in which Rushdie allegedly blasphemed Islam.    Yet there was reason for caution. In 1989, the late Ayatollah    Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic edict, condemning Rushdie to    death. Technically it remains in effect, because Iranian officials say they    cannot reverse a religious ruling by Khomeini. An Iranian foundation also    continues to offer a $2.5 million bounty on Rushdie's head, and Iranian    hard-liners who dislike the current government's modest opening to the West    still want to see Rushdie dead. (www2.usnews.com/usnews/issue/981005/5rush.htm)     Why would Dantes Alighieri risk putting himself in this position   at a time that was notorious for its harsh methods of punishment? Simply put,   he didnt. There are many reasons why Dante was not daunted by society when   writing La Divina Commedia .   Dante was already well known by the academe and the politicos   for his writings. He had already published Vita Nuova which was a libello ,   or a small book of poetry which expressed his love for Beatrice and his struggle   with her death. He had also published other works as the Convivio , written   upon his exile. Later, he wrote a book called De Vulgari Eloquentia .   Even though this book was written in Latin, it discussed the need for one common   poetry language and made a proposal against Latin. Dante's experience in language   and history was certainly made apparent in this work as he analyzed many different   languages and made his argument for a combination of the best qualities of the   fourteen to seventeen Italian dialects and approximately 30 sub-dialects he   encountered in his travels. The book argues his case against Latin with quite   a bit of reasoning. To this day, Dante Alighieri is known as the \"Father of   the Modern Italian Language\" for his writing and efforts to put into use one   common language.   A second reason Alighieri would possibly not feel worried about   writing La Divina Commedia is that he was already exiled from his beloved   city of Florence. In his next writing called the Convivio , he writes   to cleanse his reputation and to establish a view that he feels people should   have of him. This writing takes place during the time when he   struggled desperately to become a citizen of Florence once   again. He soon came to the realization that he was not returning to Florence.   It is clear that La Divina Commedia   was demeaning to powers that encompass all of Italy, but Dante   didnt have a reason to be concerned as his exile from Florence was an almost   fatal blow to his hope and pride. It is likely that many of us would develop   a \"nothing to lose\" attitude in a situation where we have suffered losses of   extreme proportions. He did not have much of what he desired; furthermore, he   did not have the ability to recoup his losses. The love of his life Beatrice   had been dead for years now and he was permanently exiled from his place of   birth and source of great pride, Florence.   Upon his exile, Dante relied upon benefactors that offered   to take the responsibility of supporting him with food, shelter, and money.   One rarely receives \"something for nothing\" as the saying goes and Dante was   certainly aware that he would be providing some sort of retribution for this   honor of being supported. His benefactors anxiously awaited his new writing;   sometimes Dante had to force them to wait for the completion of his works.   In a performance recently given at Synchronicity Space on October   24 th , 1998 in Manhattan called The Dante Project: Inferno, there   is a specific scene in which one of Dantes benefactors almost forces him to   reveal his unfinished transcript. After some argument, the benefactor gives   up, but insists that Dante \"at least\" is expected to show up for dinner to entertain   him with intellectual conversation.   Another reason that Dante's Commedia did not have the   amount of negative repercussions as it could have simply because of expectation.   After the sum total of his bitter experiences, it was only logical at the time   to assume that upon his terminal exile from Florence, and his bittering stance   on the political and religious institutions of Italy during his time, he would   probably not be writing a piece without complaints and poetic retribution.   Finally, Dante Alighieri if anything else had one immovable   ally on his side; his fervent belief in pre-ordination. If Dante had the volition   to write anything, and did, he believed it was his place in destiny to do so,   and to suffer the repercussions was simply living his life as God would want   it. His belief in pre-ordination has been documented in many publications throughout   history.   Needless to say, such a controversial poem written by a man   who was well respected may have an influence on the thinking or philosophy of   others. One of the more obscure and profound cases of Dante's influence can   be found in the study of Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli who is best known today   for his book Il Principe , or The Prince .   Alighieri and Machiavelli's lives have quite a bit in common.   Both were born in Florence (Alighieri in 1265 and Machiavelli in 1469), both   came from families that were fairly noble. Both men were eventually exiled from   Florence due to political controversies. They would both would live out their   lives as scholars, philosophers, and prolific writers, and pass on approximately   the same age.   While Dante studied Aquinas, Virgil, and the ancient Greeks,   Machiavelli studied Petrarch and Dante Alighieri. It is not an easy task to   find any substantial and direct evidence of Dante's influence on Niccol&ograve;'s   philosophy. There is no clear and direct evidence of this influence in Machiavelli's   books. Machiavelli was, however, a prolific author of personal and business   letters. There is quite an exceptional indication of Dante's influence on the   life and philosophy of Niccol&ograve; in the letters he wrote to his confidants   and colleagues.   In a letter written by Machiavelli to his confidant Francesco   Guicciardini on December 19 th , 1525, Machiavelli is encouraging his   friend to seek financial aid from the Pope to marry off his daughters. Machiavelli's   main theme of his letter is a story in which Romeo gives advice to the Duke   of Provence urging him to make a distinguished marriage for the eldest daughter,   and other successful marriages will follow. Machiavelli used quotes from Dante   to seemingly legitimatize his statements.        In short, I would try the pope just the same, and even    if I came up short in the first rime around, I would talk about my aim in    general terms, beg him to help me with it, find out where he would stand,    and proceed directly or hang back-depending on how it went. I remind you    of the advice that Romeo gave to the duke of Provence, who had four daughters;    he urged him to make a distinguished marriage for the eldest, pointing out    that she would provide an example and precedent for the rest. So, he married    her to the King of France, and gave him half of Provence as a dowry. Once    he did this, he married the others off to three kings; as Dante says:    He had four daughters, each a queen;    The cause of all this was Romeo    A pilgrim and of humble birth. &#9;(Alighieri, Paradiso    VI 133-135)    &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(Atkinson, Sices 372)     &#9;This is simply a brief except to establish that Dante was   an influence in Machiavelli's life, and this is not a completely unknown fact.   What is not common knowledge is the extent to which Dante influenced the life   of Machiavelli. &#9;Machiavelli   is best known to the world by his book called The Prince .   The Prince is a quasi handbook for the acquisition and maintenance of   Principalities. It has made Machiavelli quite infamous as a villain (although   a dedicated study of Machiavelli reveals his immorality as grossly overstated)   and as a politician/philosopher. The Prince was not completely written   under the name of Il Principe/The Prince . It had its beginnings as a   short study called De Principatibus . De Principatibus became the   first ten chapters of The Prince . In Machiavelli's own words, he stated   that without Dante Alighieri, De Principatibus and subsequently, The   Prince would not have been written.        When evening comes, I return home and enter my study; on    the threshold I take off my workday clothes covered with mud and dirt, and    put on the garments of court and palace. Fitted out appropriately, I step    inside the venerable courts of the ancients, where, solicitously received    by them, I nourish myself on that food that is alone mine and for    which I was born; where I am unashamed to converse with them and to question    them about the motives for their actions, and they, out of their human kindness,    answer me. And for hours at a time, I feel no boredom, I forget all of my    troubles, I do not dread poverty, and I am not terrified by death. I absorb    myself into them completely. And because Dante says that no one understands    anything unless he retains what he has understood, I have jotted down what    I have profited from in their conversations and composed a short study,    De Principatibus , in which I delve as deeply as I can into the ideas    concerning this topic, discussing the definition of a princedom, the categories    of princedoms, how they are acquired, how they are retained, and why they    are lost (Atkinson, Sices 264)     &#9;In Machiavelli's own words, he has stated that the ideas   to create De Principatibus , the beginnings of The Prince , were   derived and documented from his \"discourses\" with the ancients (one being Dante   Alighieri) and that he undertook this project with the motivation that Dante   said that \"No one understand anything unless he retains what he has understood.\"   After Machiavelli's death, a revised version of De   Principatibus was published as Il Principe ,   The Prince . As an aside, so much is believed and so little is actually   known of Machiavelli's motivations for writing The Prince. It is said to have   been originally written to appease the Dei Medici Family and allow him entrance   back into Florence. Actually, in the same letter cited above, Machiavelli states   that De Principatibus is to be dedicated to a man stated as His Magnificence   Giuliano which was Giuliano, duke of Nemours. Giuliano was not very interested   in Machiavelli's writing. He also died on March 17, 1516. It was then dedicated   to Lorenzo II Dei Medici who became duke of Urbino later the same year on October   8 th .        It ought to be welcomed by a prince, and especially a new    prince; therefore I am dedicating it to His Magnificence Giuliano (Atkinson,    Sices 264)     From Machiavelli to his Magnificence Giuliano, we can find   in many societies some kind of connection to or influence of Dante Alighieri.   In his death, Dante had the honor of influencing and inspiring great legends   in politics, philosophy and the arts. Salvador Dal&igrave; is an artist of legendary   proportion and needs no introduction. Dal&igrave; was commissioned by the Italian   government to create illustrations for La Divina Commedia in 1951. The   illustrations would be in commemoration of the 700 th year anniversary   of Dante's birth. Dal&igrave; was however, quite controversial as an artist   at the time. The Italians, by nature tend to be a nationalistic group of people.   There was a large faction of Italian people who opposed Dante's commemoration   to be done by a Spaniard. The commission was soon rescinded; however; Dal&igrave;   was greatly affected by La Divina Commedia and proceeded to create 100   interpretive illustrations. He created 34 illustrations for Dantes Inferno,   33 for Dante's Purgatorio and another 33 for the Paradiso - one can only imagine   what force a writing has when it inspired one of historys most sought after   artists works; and so many of them! Every one of Dal&igrave;s works has (a)   specific Canto(s) in which it was inspired. Dal&igrave; as well as his work   have been an inspiration and influential force in the world. When once asked   about Dante Alighieri, Dal&igrave; said he was fascinated by \"his angelic vision   of being and cosmic side of God; incomprehensible for man, and reflected in   the mirror of the face of the angel\". (Generalitat de Catalunya 50) It is obvious   why La Divina Commedia inspired such works of art as it truly is a breakthrough   in terms of creating visions with words. It carries within its words the power   of vivid imagery. The method in which Alighieri used his verse to make the reader   see all that he is experiencing is that of a master. His verses have the power   to make one cry for joy in Paradiso as well as writhe in horror during his descent   through the depths of hell.   tal, non per foco, ma per divin'arte,   bollia l&agrave; giuso una pegola spessa,   che 'nviscava la ripa d'ogne parte.   I' vedea lei, ma non vedea in essa   mai che le bolle che 'l bollor levava,   e gonfiar tutta, e riseder compressa   che, per veder, non indugia 'l partire:   e vidi dietro a noi un diavol nero   correndo su per lo scoglio venire.   Ahi quant'elli era ne l'aspetto fero!   e quanto mi parea ne l'atto acerbo,   con l'ali aperte e sovra i pi&egrave; leggero!   L'omero suo, ch'era aguto e superbo,   carcava un peccator con ambo l'anche,   e quei tenea de' pi&egrave; ghermito 'l nerbo   so, not by fire but by the art of God,   below there boiled a thick and tarry mass   that covered all the banks with clamminess.   I saw it, but I could not see within it;   no thing was visible but boiling bubbles,   the swelling of the pitch; and then it settled   who does not stop his flight and yet would look.   And then in back of us I saw a black   demon as he came racing up the crags.   Ah, he was surely barbarous to see!   And how relentless seemed to me his acts!   His wings were open and his feet were lithe;   across his shoulder, which was sharp and high,   he had slung a sinner, upward from the thighs;   in front, the demon gripped him by the ankles   He threw the sinner down, then wheeled along   The stony cliff: no mastiff's ever been   unleashed with so much haste to chase a thief.   The sinner plunged, then surfaced, black with pitch;   but now the demons, from beneath the bridge,   shouted: \"The Sacred Face has no place here;   here we swim differently than in the Serchio;   if you don't want to feel our grappling hooks,   don't try to lift yourself above that ditch.\"   They pricked him with a hundred prongs and more,   then taunted: \"Here one dances under cover,   so try to grab your secret graft below.\"   The demons did the same as any cook   who has his urchins force the meat with hooks   deep down into the pot, that it not float.   (Alighieri/Mandelbaum 187-188)       It is to no surprise that even in modern media, Dantes hell   is used as a template. The movie released only this year, What Dreams May   Come is about a man (Robin Williams) who dies in a car accident and goes   to heaven, which takes the form of his personal paradise. He joins his children   in heaven as they had already been killed in a previous car accident. His wife   (Annabella Sciorra) is struggling to keep hope up as she feel she has nothing   to live for. She gives up hope, commits suicide, and consequently goes to hell   (the same fate she would suffer in the La Divina Commedia ). Williams   defies her fate, and out of true love for his wife, travels through the depths   of hell to find her. In his journey through hell, he comes upon a land in which   sinners are buried up to their necks in soil and the dust blinds some of the   sinners eyes. As he tries to walk on this ground comprised of suffering humans,   he accidentally steps on them and they yell out in pain and ask the question,   \"Why are you walking on me?\" Williams, upon the pleading of an old man, clears   his eyes of the dust, and a dialogue ensues.   This scene is an almost exact re-creation of Dantes Ptolomea;   the ninth circle of hell, third ring where the sinners are buried up to their   heads in ice (not soil), and their eyes are frozen shut by the tears they shed.   The text in Divina Commedia portrays a similar scenario, and the influence   of this movie is clearly of Alighieri.   Oh sovra tutte mal creata plebe   che stai nel loco onde parlare &egrave; duro,   mei foste state qui pecore o zebe!   Come noi fummo gi&ugrave; nel pozzo scuro   sotto i pi&egrave; del gigante assai pi&ugrave; bassi,   e io mirava ancora a l'alto muro,   dicere udi'mi: Guarda come passi:   va s&igrave;, che tu non calchi con le piante   le teste de' fratei miseri lassi.   E un de' tristi de la fredda   crosta grid&ograve; a noi: O anime crudeli   tanto che data v'&egrave; l'ultima posta,   levatemi dal viso i duri veli,   s&igrave; ch'io sfoghi 'l duol che 'l cor m'impregna,   un poco, pria che 'l pianto si raggeli.   Per ch'io a lui: Se vuo' ch'i' ti sovvegna,   dimmi chi se', e s'io non ti disbrigo,   al fondo de la ghiaccia ir mi convegna   O rabble ill-begotten above all,   Who're in the place to speak of which is hard,   'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats !   When we were down within the darksome well,   Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,   And I was scanning still the lofty wall,   heard it said to me: \"Look how thou steppest I   Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet   The heads of the tired, miserable brothers !\"   And one of the wretches of the frozen crust   Cried out to us: \"O souls so merciless   That the last post is given unto you,   Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I   May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart   A little, e'er the weeping recongeal.\"   Whence I to him: \"If thou wouldst have me help thee   Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,   May I go to the bottom of the ice.\"   (Alighieri/Mandelbaum 293,307)       For hundreds of years, Dante Alighieri's love for his art of   writing and his creation Divina Commedia have been an inspiration to   thousands of scholars, scientists, artists and philosophers around the world.   A creation of love that has affected and will continue to compel thousands,   is not done justice by a simple analysis. Although it is our right to judge   upon our knowledge of Alighieri to make a character analysis, it would take   a number of lifetimes to be able to understand and fully appreciate Alighieri's   life and works. Let the man who made his belief in the failure of words clear   throughout the Divina Commedia , let him speak now in his own words as   an example of the writing that has profoundly affected generations.   Bernardo m'accennava, e sorridea,   perch'io guardassi suso; ma io era   gi&agrave; per me stesso tal qual ei volea:   ch&eacute; la mia vista, venendo sincera,   e pi&ugrave; e pi&ugrave; intrava per lo raggio   de l'alta luce che da s&eacute; &egrave; vera   Da quinci innanzi il mio veder fu maggio   che 'l parlar mostra, ch'a tal vista cede,   e cede la memoria a tanto oltraggio.   Qual &egrave; colui che sognando vede,   che dopo 'l sogno la passione impressa   rimane, e l'altro a la mente non riede,   cotal son io, ch&eacute; quasi tutta cessa   mia visione, e ancor mi distilla   nel core il dolce che nacque da essa.   Cos&igrave; la neve al sol si disigilla;   cos&igrave; al vento ne le foglie levi   si perdea la sentenza di Sibilla.   O somma luce che tanto ti levi   da' concetti mortali, a la mia mente   ripresta un poco di quel che parevi,   e fa la lingua mia tanto possente,   ch'una favilla sol de la tua gloria   possa lasciare a la futura gente;   ch&eacute;, per tornare alquanto a mia memoria   e per sonare un poco in questi versi,   pi&ugrave; si conceper&agrave; di tua vittoria.   (Alighieri/Vandelli 917-918)     Bernard indicated to me, and smiled,   for me to look above; but I was   already for myself doing the same as which he wanted   that my sight, becoming clearer,   and more and more (able to glimpse into) the beam   of the (exalted) light that itself is real   From then on, what I saw was greater   than the \"spoken word\" can express, at such a sight surrenders,   the memory when faced with such (divine) excess.   It is like that of he who dreaming sees,   that after the dream's passion imprinted,   remains, and the rest the mind cannot rebuild,   such am I, that almost completely fades   my vision, and yet it still distills   in (my) heart the sweetness that was born from it.   Like this the snow under the sun thaws   like this the wind lifts the leaves   (and) is lost the saying(s) of Sibyl   Oh supreme light that you are so far lifted   from mortal concepts , to my mind   give me again (even) a little of that which you appeared   and make my tongue so powerful,   that a glimmer of your glory   can be left to the future people;   that for returning (even) somewhat to my memory   and for echoing (even) a little in these verses,   it can be more understood - your victory.

Giordano Bruno and the Art of Memory    ITAL-UA  148 Identical to HIST-UA 126, MEDI-UA 148. No prerequisites. Seminar, conducted in English. Offered every two to three years. Cipani. 4 points.    The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement during the Italian Renaissance. Far more than instruments for remembering, memory devices aimed to organize knowledge and were intended as tools for creative output. We examine the impact of the culture of memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the interdependence between textual and visual codes. Focuses on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno, burned at the stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe. Sampling the varied textual genres of Bruno's work (philosophical dialogues, writings on magic, a satirical comedy), we seek to answer the same question posed to Bruno by Henry III of France: is the Art of Memory acquired \"by magic\" or \"by science\"?

Urban life is a   constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New   York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual   frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the   ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the   Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance,   particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat   of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and   the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of   political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world   communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and   urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle,   Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de   Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now   becoming visible.  ITAL-UA 115 Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature Tuesday/Thursday 9:30am-10:45am, CASA Library Instructor TBD Conducted in Italian , (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission)  Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from   its origins to 17th century.     ITAL-UA 148 Giordano Bruno and the Art of Memory (same as HIST-UA 126) Tuesday 12:30pm-3:15pm, CASA Library Cipani Conducted in English The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the Italian Renaissance. Far more than a mere tool for passive retention of information: memory devices had the ambition to assist in the structuring of thought, the organization of knowledge, the solving of philosophical questions, and were intended also as tools for creative output. This course examines the impact of the pervasive culture of memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the interdependence between textual and visual codes. A main focus will be on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno, burnt at stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe and of nature's creative principles. We will first examine Bruno's works explicitly devoted to memory, assessing elements of continuity and innovation with respect to the tradition. Subsequently, sampling Bruno's Italian dialogues, his writings on magic, and his satyrical comedy Candlebearer, we will look for intersections between his theory of memory, on the one hand, and his strategy of self-representation, his literary style, and his doctrine of infinity on the other. ITAL-UA 164 Italian Colonialism (same as HIST-UA 204, EURO-UA 161) Monday 9:30am-12:15pm, CASA Library Ben-Ghiat Conducted in English ITAL-UA 172 Topics: Narrating Immigrant Experience Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA Library Lakhous Conducted in English How can we narrate immigration today? Can we argue that the immigrant experience is universal? How can we recount family memories of immigration? What is the relationship between identity and memory? What are the connections between immigration, emigration, and colonialism? We will attempt to answer such questions \u2013 and to approach different narratives of immigrant experience \u2013 through novels, films, documentaries, and essays. We will examine cases in different national and cultural contexts. We will look in particular at the Italian case; for, Italy represents a unique case in the world: after decades of exporting immigrants, it has become an importer. But we will also examine other histories and experiences (whether in China, Vietnam, Tunisia, France, Romania, the USA, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and others); internal migration (especially to the North of Italy in the fifties and the sixties); and finally non-European Community immigrants.  ITAL-UA 173 Topics in Italian Culture: Medieval Italy Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm, CASA Library Vise Conducted in English Medieval Italy can look like a land replete with impossible contradiction. The northern cities witnessed Europe\u2019s first stirrings of formal republican self-governance since the Fall of Rome but also the violent repression of political dissenters; the flowering of vernacular literature in writers like Petrarca, Dante and Boccaccio but also the highest levels of Latinity in Europe; the development of systems of justice to which modern institutions trace their origin but also notoriously bloody factional violence and vendetta; the boom of a mercantile economy but also wildly popular grassroots religious critiques of wealth. In one city we find the first broad-based emancipation of slaves and serfs in the West while in another, the brutal exclusion of the turbulent lower-class guild of wool carders from political life. They were the \u201ccities of God\u201d where sometimes heretics ruled. The Mezzogiorno, southern Italy, glittered with literary and artistic achievement and bustled with ethnic and religious diversity under the succession of multiple foreign monarchies. And in the middle, the Papal States staggered in competition with the powers of the North, the South, and its own squabbling aristocracy. Yet at the same time, its ruler claimed a monopoly on the souls of European Christians and operated the highest court of appeals for major European legal disputes. In this class, we will explore this complex culture by looking at a wide range of primary sources from poetry to prisoner graffiti, high and low art, and complimentary secondary sources. The course will begin with the early medieval period and the emergence of the communes, Papal states, and Southern Kingdom after the fall of Rome and then proceed thematically to conclude by considering what this period bequeathed to subsequent generations. For each theme, our central question will remain: were these deep contrasts ultimately a source of strength and creativity or of chaos and division? Topics to be covered include: legal and extra-legal justice, religious plurality, politics and religion, women and gender, wealth and poverty, intellectual life, art and patronage, factions and la familia , and the creation of state.  ITAL-UA 174 Italian Films, Italian Histories I (same as DRLIT-UA 503, EURO-UA 173) Tuesday, 12:30pm-3:15pm &amp; Thursday 12:30pm-1:45pm CASA Auditorium Albertini Conducted in English Sample Syll abus  Films are responsible for creating a national identity more than any other medium of communication. Cinematography has played a much more prominent role in the construction of a common popular history in Italy, than in other European states, given the relatively young age of the unified Italian nation. From the papier-mach\u00e9 buildings of ancient Rome presented in the very first Italian movies to the powerful non-professional actors of neorealistic cinema representing the Nazi occupation of the peninsula; these are the images that for generations of Italians represent Italian History, much more than the fading memories of high-school textbooks or of high-brow intellectual debates rigorously kept in the seldom read pages of national newspapers. The purpose of this course (that is ideally completed by \"Italian Films, Italian Histories II\" taught by Professor Ben-Ghiat in the Spring) is to provide a general but accurate overview of Italian history and a critical analysis of its representation through films from the origins to the Risorgimento. This (first) course is devoted to Roman, Medieval, and Renaissance history and it closes with a rather in-depth presentation of different accounts of the Risorgimento (the process of Italian unification). ITAL-UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy (same as COLIT-UA 270, ENGL-UA 142, MEDI-UA 271) Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm, CASA Auditorium Conducted in English   SPRING 2015  ITAL-UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature  Tuesday/Thursday 9:30am-10:45am, CASA 201 Antonangeli Conducted in Italian , (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission) Introductory-level literature course that, through a close reading of   authors such as Alfieri, Foscolo, Leopardi, Manzoni, Verga, D'Annunzio,   Moravia, and Calvino, focuses on how to understand a literary text in   Italian. Covers Italian literature from the 18th century to the   contemporary period. ITAL-UA 121 The Renaissance (same as HIST-UA 121, MEDI-UA 121) Tuesday/Thursday 3:30pm-4:45pm, TISC LC9 Appuhn Conducted in English ITAL-UA 172 Hellscapes and Elysia in the Renaissance and Beyond (same as COLIT-UA 173, ENGL-UA 56, MEDI-UA 172) Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm, CASA 201 McHugh Conducted in English Syllabus  This course explores various representations of otherworlds, both infernal and paradisal: the realms of the afterlife, regions of marvel or idyllic bliss, political utopias and dystopias. Readings and discussion focus on how these imagined lands reflect, critique, and animate the real world, from antiquity through our own times.  ITAL-UA 173.001 Murder, Italian Style! (same as DRLIT-UA 505) Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA 201 Falkoff Course conducted in English; reading knowledge of Italian recommended but not required. A genre whose development is associated with urbanization, crime fiction\u2014like so many other emblems of modernity\u2014is often considered to have arrived belatedly in Italy. Despite this initial reticence, several critically acclaimed writers of contemporary Italy have used the genre as a narrative space from which to launch a broader commentary on aspects of Italian history and culture such as the fascist period, honor killings, police brutality, political corruption, femicide, and xenophobia. This course will consider novels, plays, and films from the 1950s to the present, analyzing the ways in which they use conventions of the crime fiction as a point of departure for literary experimentation, philosophical reflection, and cultural critique. ITAL-UA 173.002 Italy and the Mediterranean: Empire, Politics and Culture (same as AHSEM-UA 218.001 and MEIS-UA 659.001) Tuesday/Thursday 4:55pm-6:10pm, CASA 306 Valerie McGuire Conducted in English NOTE: ONLY OPEN TO CAS SOPHOMORES, JUNIORS, AND SENIORS Shortly after its unification in 1861, the Italian nation began a prolonged attempt to establish an overseas empire on a scale with other European colonial powers. This course examines how Italian imperialism unfolded and how it impacted politics and culture on the global level, as well as how it shaped internal attitudes and beliefs, particularly during Italy\u2019s Fascist period. The course studies the formation of Italy\u2019s national project under two different empires and discovers how processes such as emigration and the Southern Question intertwined with its first attempts to establish foreign colonies. As Ottoman collapse and the First World War initiated a new phase of European colonialism, Italy turned to the Mediterranean as the domain of its empire. We investigate how the Mediterranean region ignited fantasies of the exotic and the familiar and how it both promoted and challenged Italian myths of national identity. The course studies Italy\u2019s imperial history and culture through a range of medium, including film, novels and scholarly articles. Reading knowledge in Italian is a plus but not a requisite. ITAL-UA 282 Italian Cinema and Literature Tuesday 12:30-1:45pm and Thursday 12:30-3:15pm CASA Auditorium Albertini Course conducted in Italian (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission) Sample Syllabus The course will focus on the development of Italian cinema in the post war period, emphasizing the relationship between literature and film adaptation. The books and the films will offer a unique opportunity to analyze and discuss crucial issues related to the historical, political, and cultural evolution of Italy concentrating in particular on the political unification process (Risorgimento). ITAL-UA 285 Topics in Italian Literature: Dante's Purgatorio (same as ENGL-UA 52 and MEDI-UA 285.001) Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA 201 Conducted in English ITAL-UA 724 Italian-American Life in Literature (same as ENGL-UA 724) Tuesday/Thursday 11am-12:15pm, CASA 201 Hendin Conducted in English Sample Syllabus A   study of the fiction and poetry through which Italian American writers   have expressed their heritage and their engagement in American life.   From narratives of immigration to current work by \"assimilated\" writers,   the course explores the depiction of Italian American identity.   Challenging stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships,   sexual mores, and political and social concerns. ITAL-UA 760 Topics in the Renaissance: Visual Languages of the Renaissance: Emblems, Dreams, Hieroglyphs (same as MEDI-UA 760.001) Thursday 12:30pm-3:00pm, CASA 201 Cipani Conducted in English Syllabus Making knowledge visible was one of the great Renaissance endeavors. Some of the period's most characteristic products were born out of the conviction that concepts could be systematically turned into images \u2014 and that such images could be organized into a visual language, more profound and universal than discursive logic. Egyptian hieroglyphs and dream visions, in their mysterious graphic exuberance, were considered typical vehicles of this advanced mode of communication. The desire to emulate their symbolic density is reflected both in literature and in art, often in ways that challenge common distinctions between visual and verbal communication. In this course you will be introduced to an assortment of works representative of such interplay between text and image: emblem books, dream books and dream-centered works, hieroglyphic inventions and studies, collections of proverbs, iconology manuals, etc. Among the books examined are some widely considered as the finest examples of design in the history of printing. Early modern and recent theory of emblems will also be discussed. As a present-day counterpart of Renaissance emblems, the course will conclude with a survey of corporate logos and Russian criminal tattoos. CORE-UA 554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Tuesday/Thursday 12:30-1:45PM FALL 2014  CORE-UA 400-70 Texts and Ideas: Visible and Invisible Cities Tuesday/Thursday 11:00am-12:15pm, CASA Auditorium Cox Sample Syllabus The experience of living in a city is one vital thread that connects us with our ancient, medieval, and early modern ancestors, and that continues to provide a unifying element in millions of our contemporaries\u2019 disparate lives across the globe. Urban life is a constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance, particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle, Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now becoming visible. ITAL-UA 115 Readings in Medieval &amp; Renaissance Literature CANCELED ITAL-UA 165 Italian Fascism (same as HIST-UA 171) Monday 11am-1:45pm Ben-Ghiat Conducted in English Syllabus This interdisciplinary course examines the dictatorship that ruled Italy between 1922 and 1943. We address the relationship between culture and politics, public and private; Fascist biopolitics; anti-Fascism; fascist colonialism and racism; the cult of Mussolini; and Fascist-era feminities and masculinities. We will combine secondary sources with readings of Fascist speeches and anti-Fascist novels, and viewings of newsreels and Fascist war films. The course is conducted in English, and most of the readings are in English. ITAL-UA 166 Contemporary Italy (same as EURO-UA 164) Tuesday/Thursday 12:30pm-1:45pm Albertini Conducted in English Covers the political, cultural, economic, and social history of Italy since World War II. Starting with the transition from fascism to democracy, examines the Cold War, the growth of a mass consumer society, the social and political movements of the late 1960s and 1970s, the battle against the Mafia, postwar emigration, the rise and fall of postwar Christian Democracy and Italian communism, and the emergence of new parties in the 1990s such as Berlusconi's Forza Italia, Bossi's Northern League, and Fini's neofascist Alleanza Nazionale. ITAL-UA 172 Portraits of Women: From 19th to 20th Century Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm Ducci Conducted in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30 Advanced Review of Modern Italian) The purpose of this class is to understand the changing image and voice of Italian women in a period of intense change from traditionalism to modernity. The course is based on a choice of short texts in Italian, selected for their relevance and accessible language, combined with images and visual material taken from painting, photography, fashion, theater, and film. The emphasis is on improving skills of reading and communication in Italian, while at the same time discussing the history of gender and its politics in a country where the struggle between tradition and change often invests the image and life of women. ITAL-UA 173 Violence and Memory in Contemporary Italy Tuesday/Thursday 2:00-3:15pm Forgacs Conducted in English Sample Syllabus Acts of violence, against individuals or groups of people, have played an important part in the collective memory of Italy after Fascism. However, they have also been open to conflicting interpretations. Was the execution of Mussolini and Clara Petacci and the public desecration of their corpses in Milan in 1945 an act of legitimate retribution for the sufferings inflicted by the Fascist regime and its alliance with Nazi Germany or an act that displaced Italians\u2019 collective guilt over acquiescence? Were the bullets and bombs of the \u201canni di piombo\u201d from 1969 to 1980 assaults on the fabric of a democratic society or symptoms of a malfunctioning political system and civil society? Did the collective mourning of mafia victims in the 1990s allow attention to be turned away from collusion between politicians and organized crime? Why are some massacres well known and publicly commemorated and others largely removed from collective memory? This course takes five cases where violence has given rise to these kinds of controversy and debate over historical memory. ITAL-UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm Freccero Conducted in English Sample Syllabus Students study The Divine Comedy both as a mirror of high medieval culture and as a unique text that breaks out of its cultural bounds. The entire poem is read, in addition to selections from the Vita Nuova and other complementary minor works. ITAL-UA 285-001 Love in the Renaissance: From Lyric to Letters Wednesday 11am-1:45pm Bolzoni Conducted in English, Readings in Italian . Love is one of the central themes of the Renaissance literature. The course is aimed to investigate how such topic is represented and discussed in different literary genres: poetry, theatre, letters, chivalric poems. Special attention will be paid to the representation of passions and the figure of woman. During the course, a number of texts will be read: compositions of women poets, such as Gaspara Stampa and Isabella di Morra, will be analysed; among the theatre pieces, La Mandragola by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli; as far as letters are concerned, students will investigate the epistolary exchange between Pietro Bembo and Maria Savorgnan; finally, regarding the chivalric poems, episodes from Orlando innamorato of Matteo M.

ITAL-UA 160 Dante and His World (same as COLIT-UA 173, ENGL-UA 143 and MEDI-UA 801) MW 12:30pm-1:45pm Ardizzone                           Interdisciplinary introduction to late medieval culture, using Dante, its foremost literary artist, as a focus. Attention is directed to literature, art, and music, in addition to political, religious, and social developments of the time.

ITAL-UA 173 Visions on and of Mafia MW 2:00-3:15PM Montalbano From its local origins in Sicily, the Mafia has become a global phenomenon and a widespread model of organized crime that threatens and corrupts the international economy, political systems, and social environments. Though its power and underworld affect legal business, control illegal traffic, and trample human rights, nevertheless film, television, and literature stimulate a continued fascination with a romantic and even heroic vision of the Mafia. In this seminar we will explore and compare American and Italian films on the Mafia and the literary texts upon which many of them are based from the late 1940s to today. Combining the analyses of historians, sociologists, and intellectuals, along with the testimonies of victims, we will not only challenge the stereotypes through which cultural productions envision the Mafiosi but also, and more importantly, we will shift the inquiry to how the Mafiosi envision the world by asking: What is the ideology of Mafia? How do Mafiosi picture society, human beings, and law? Does Mafia have its own ethic? How does a religious imaginary shape a Mafia worldview? How does Mafia\u2019s normative discourse govern the performance of femininity, masculinity, and homosexuality? Can we consider Mafia to be terrorism? Examining together the visions on and of Mafia through cultural, socio-political, and historical perspectives, this seminar aims to deconstruct the mythological eye and instead form an analytical eye with which to investigate and understand the Mafioso universe and power. ITAL-UA 175 Italian Films, Italian Histories II (same as HIST-UA 176, CINE-UT 235, DRLIT-UA 506) M 11:00am-12:15pm; W 11:00am-1:45pm Ben-Ghiat Studies representations  of Italian history from the unification of Italy to the present  through the medium of film.

Challenging stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships, sexual mores, and political and social concerns. ITAL-UA 760-001 Giordano Bruno &amp; the Art of Memory (same as MEDI-UA 760-001) TR 12:30pm-1:45pm Cipani The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the Italian Renaissance. Far more than a mere tool for passive retention of information: memory devices had the ambition to assist in the structuring of thought, the organization of knowledge, the solving of philosophical questions, and were intended also as tools for creative output. This course examines the impact of the pervasive culture of memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the interdependence between textual and visual codes. A main focus will be on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno, burnt at stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe and of nature's creative principles. Sampling the varied textual genres of Bruno's work (philosophical dialogues, writings on magic, a satirical comedy), one of the questions this course aims to answer is the same posed to Bruno by Henry III King of France: is the Art of Memory acquired \"by magic\" or \"by science\"? ITAL-UA 760-002 Humanism in the Renaissance (same as MEDI-UA 760-002) MW 11:00am-12:15pm Freccero  FALL 2013  ITAL UA 115 Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature  MW 9:30-10:45am,  Casa Library  Taught in Italian  (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30; Same as MEDI 115) Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian.

ITAL-UA 142 - The Courtesan in Renaissance Culture &amp; Society Cox TR 11-12:30pm, Casa Library Examines an intriguing figure within the social panorama of Renaissance Italy, the \"honest courtesan\" or cortigiana onesta. It contextualizes courtesans' social position and cultural status, embracing elements of social history, literary history, and music and art history.

ITAL UA 173-001 Topics in Italian Culture: Media, Society and Politics in Italy: Since 1943  Forgacs TR 2-3:15pm, Casa Library The course aims to give students a good understanding of how the mass media and popular cultural forms have interacted with social change and political power in Italy from the fall of Fascism to the present. Some observers have seen postwar Italy as following a relatively normal pattern of evolution of the mass media within a democratic polity, whereas others have seen Italy as exceptional, among the western democracies, both for the degree of political interferences with the media and, since the later 1990s, for the breakdown of democratic norms. This course will enable students to assess these views in an informed way. It will also allow them to consider how far the media should be seen as mirrors of social change and how far were they themselves agents of change. The course will cover some of the most significant moments and turning points in the political and social history of the period, using contemporary sources and documents from various media.   ITAL UA 174 Italian Films, Italian Histories I Albertini T 12:30-3:15pm; R 12:30-1:45pm, Casa Auditorium  Studies representation of Italian history through the medium of film from ancient Rome through the Risorgimento. Issues to be covered throughout include the use of filmic history as a means of forging national identity.  ITAL UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy in Translation Freccero MW 11-12:15pm Casa Auditorium (same as MEDI 271, COLIT 270, ENGL 142)  Students   study the Divine Comedy both as a mirror of high medieval culture and   as a unique text that breaks out of its cultural bounds. The entire poem   is read, in addition to selections from the Vita Nuova and other   complementary minor works.  ITAL UA 271 Boccaccio's Decameron  Ardizzone MW 2:00-3:15pm, Casa Library A study of Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron with particular emphasis on themes, conceptual innovations, and influences on French and English literatures. ITAL-UA 285 Topics in Italian Literature: Food in Italian Literature and Culture - The Art of Taste, The Taste of Nation: Italian Literary and Cinematic Gastronomy Falkoff TR 12:30-1:45pm, Casa Library Casa Library Sample Syllabus \u201cWhat is the glory of Dante compared to spaghetti?\u201d Italian journalist Giuseppe Prezzolini famously asks in his 1954 history of pasta. While numerous cookbooks cite Prezzolini to evoke Italy\u2019s consummate culinary achievements, this course instead poses the question: \u201cWhat is the glory of spaghetti compared to its representation in literature and film?\u201d We begin the semester with short stories by Giovanni Boccaccio in which the preparation and consumption of food becomes a critical act of communication. Turning to films, novels, memoirs, cookbooks, and manifestos from the late nineteenth century to the present, we will reflect upon the narrative functions of elaborate descriptions of culinary triumphs. Do such descriptions constitute a form of \u201cfood-porn\u201d? If so, how is the project of reading and interpreting the texts changed? We will also ask what ideological work is performed by literary gastronomy; and how it contributes to the production of national, regional, and local identities, and socioeconomic differences.   SUMMER 2013  Six-Week Session 1 (May 28-July 5) ITAL-UA 10 Intensive Elementary Italian Instructors: Nicola Lucchi, Wayne Clinger M-F, 9AM-12PM  Six-Week Session 2 (July 8-August 16) ITAL-UA 20 Intensive Intermediate Italian Instructors: Jennifer Newman, Melissa Swain M-F, 9AM-12PM ITAL-UA 173 Italian Crimes, Italian Fictions Instructor: Franco Baldasso Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2PM-5PM The history of Italian culture hides a proliferation of murky stories. Admired literary representations from Dante\u2019s Inferno to Machiavellian politicians, and the cinematic allure of criminal organizations such as mafia or camorra, are only some of the reasons why Italy stands out in the global imagination today also for its crimes, its mysteries and its alluring sinners. Through crime fiction, writers and filmmakers analyze, criticize, and unveil the violence of politics, the complexity of Italian history and its difficult modernization, the collective traumas and the conformism of a society always eager to find a scapegoat for its vices. This course aims to shed new light on modern Italian culture and society through the perspective of the books and films illuminating this dark side. Crime fiction in Italy has a specific name, \u201cil giallo\u201d, from the color of the covers of the popular books that invaded Italian market. \u201cI gialli\u201d are not only a literary genre \u2013 many groundbreaking movies featuring prominent Italian actors and directors, from Mastroianni to Volont\u00e9, share the name. The genre is a major player in Italian self-representation even beyond Hollywood clich\u00e9s. The course will approach modern Italian novels, from Moravia to Sciascia, and their filmic adaptations tackling issues such as the fascist mentality, the evolution of mafia as a modern global enterprise, political terrorism, social and gender exclusion\u2013\u2013looking at what is behind enduring stereotypes about Italians.  SPRING 2013  ITAL UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature Ziegler TR 9:30-10:45AM, Casa Libary Taught in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30) Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from   its origins to 17th century.     ITAL UA 166 Contemporary Italy: Identities, Society, and Culture Albertini TR 2-3:15PM, Casa Library Taught in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30) Covers the political,  cultural, economic, and social history of Italy since World War II.  Starting with the transition from fascism to democracy, examines the  Cold War, the growth of a mass consumer society, the social and  political movements of the late 1960s and 1970s, the battle against  the Mafia, postwar emigration, the rise and fall of postwar Christian  Democracy and Italian communism, and the emergence of new parties in  the 1990s such as Berlusconi's Forza Italia, Bossi's Northern  League, and Fini's neofascist Alleanza Nazionale.    ITAL UA 173-001 Topics in Italian Culture: Verdi's Contexts Izzo TR 11-12:15PM, Casa Auditorium This   course addresses the intersection of art and ideology in Italy,   Germany, Spain, France, and the Soviet Union, during the period   1914-1968. In each instance, we will examine the tensions between   cultures of fascism and anti- fascism ,   both visual and verbal. Addressing the development of fascist ideology   and its relationship to culture, our focus will shift from Futurist   proto-fascist incitements to nationalist war and colonialism, to Dadaist   subversion of that same rhetoric, to the shifting and evolving tensions   of these forces throughout the period between the World Wars. Along the   way, we will examine the representational strategies of different   political systems (and their dissenters) in context: Nazi Germany,   Mussolini\u2019s Italy, Popular Front and Vichy France, Republican and   Franco\u2019s Spain, and (as a counterpoint) the post-revolutionary Soviet   Union. Addressing both the interventions of particular artists, as well   as broader issues of media and modernism, we will consider how the   struggle between fascism and anti- fascism    lies at the heart of twentieth-century culture. We will look at a   variety of media, objects, and texts: from film and photography, to   painting and exhibitions, to posters and spectacles, to poems and   manifestos. In each instance will consider some specific case studies,   whether the 1932 Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution or the 1937   Degenerate Art Exhibition in Nazi Germany.  ITAL UA 283 Other Worlds: Travel Literature in Italy Ferrari MW 2-3:15pm, Casa Library Ubiquitous   concepts - \"home,\" \"discovery,\" \"difference,\" - appear to be simple;   yet they mask complex literary and social themes. This course will   analyze how a voyage changes not only our conception of a given   destination, but also of our point of departure: of all the familiar   surroundings, signposts, and people that we recognize as \"home.\" Home is   then defined not simply as one's family and household but as all the   components that shape one's identity and sense of belonging, such as   nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, and gender. Every journey is   marked by displacement: a transformation that calls into question the   traveler's original position so that, to borrow Thomas Wolfe's phrase,   one can never \"go home again.\" This course will examine a selection of   Italian travel narratives within the context of contemporary   post-colonial theory. Questions to be addressed include: the relation   between power and the production of knowledge as it manifests itself in   such narratives; intertextuality and its ideological effects; modes of   representation of racial, cultural, historical, and sexual otherness.  ITAL UA 285-001 Tpcs in Italian Literature: Remapping Italian Cultural History: Private and Public Intellectuals in Italy from St. Francis to Boccaccio Ardizzone MW 12:30-1:45PM, Casa Library This course enlarges the range of texts offered in an undergraduate course on early modern Italian culture, including works less well known and not considered part of the canon. We begin by focusing on the notion of an intellectual as defined by both contemporary and non-contemporary historians or philosophers like J. Le Goff, A. De Libera, E. Said, A. Gramsci, and R. W. Emerson. The works of these authors will allow us to expand the notion of the intellectual and to introduce as intellectual every commitment resulting in a work useful to the public in the broadest sense. Dante\u2019s statement that being intellectual means knowing our proper goal or the aim of our actions introduces the idea that every human work is intellectually motivated either by being directed to the public or by being conceived in a private way. We therefore introduce the idea that both public and private intellectuals, directly or indirectly, collaborate in creating a work of collective use and identity. That a public intellectual must first be a private intellectual is our starting point. Under the category of intellectual we therefore list the sailors committed to making portolan charts and the mapmakers who devised instruments for practical knowledge.In the same way, we include the merchants who invented the single-double entry in bookkeeping. The figure of a saint like St. Francis of Assisi is part of the picture because he has advanced human freedom and awareness. The pilgrims who link devotion and travel enter the list, along with poets, writers, statesmen and masters of rhetoric, philosophers, craftsmen, and artists. Theory and pragmatism are considered in the course as deeply connected. Literary, philosophical culture is linked to technical scientific knowledge. Readings include works by St. Francis and St. Claire of Assisi, Marco Polo, Pier delle Vigne, Brunetto Latini, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, along with texts written by merchants and pilgrims. Works of artists from Romanesque to Gothic will be considered, as well as those of cartographers or makers of portolans. The course concludes by touching briefly on the culture of the Quattrocento and the new emerging model of the intellectual that is proposed, for example, in the Florentine culture of that time. The course will be given in English.

From   narratives of immigration to current work by \"assimilated\" writers, the   course explores the depiction of Italian American identity. Challenging   stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships, sexual mores,   and political and social concerns.  ITAL UA 760 Tpcs in Renaissance: Giordano Bruno and the Art of Memory  Cipani TR 12:30-1:45PM, Casa Library The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the   Italian Renaissance.

This course proposes and examination of Italian Americans as   represented in mainstream and independent American cinema, and later   television, from the silent era to the present.
