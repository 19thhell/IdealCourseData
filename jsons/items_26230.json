GE are graduate level.    LIBAR-UE 0941 Art: Practice and Ideas Steinhardt students can satisfy &ldquo;Expressive Cultures&rdquo; requirement. Art: Practice and Ideas examines key developments in the visual arts from modernity to the present. Focusing on the ways in which representations both create &amp; reflect the values of a society, the course introduces students to the full range of expressive possibilities within the visual arts, covering painting &amp; sculpture, as well as photography, film, video, conceptual art, &amp; computer media. Topics to be covered include classical, modern, &amp; postmodern relationships to politics, vision, the mind, the body, psychology, gender, difference, &amp; technological innovation. Students will see and understand how artists have integrated perceptions of their historical moment, as well as physical &amp; social space, into creative practices that have, in turn, had a significant impact on the culture of the time. ARTCR-UE 0050 Modern Art and Contemporary Culture Examines the impact of modernism in both its historic &amp; contemporary relationships to culture &amp; society, through the study of painting, sculpture, architecture, &amp; the media arts from the late 1800&rsquo;s to the late 1950s. Art history with a theoretical &amp; aesthetic emphasis. Relates the art of the period to political, social, &amp; philosophical issues &amp; to current debates. Works of art are considered from slides, films, and reproductions. ART-UE 1914 Interdisciplinary Projects: Representation and Identity Open only to art majors or by permission. Prerequisite: three semesters of painting. Consideration of particular techniques allows students to broaden the range of their skills and expression. This is a studio class. Each week begins with a 20-minute discussion of current gallery or museum exhibitions that we have seen. Critiques will be every 3rd week. Students will be expected to work on their own ideas or projects. I will work with each student based on where they are in that process. Technical advice will be individual as well. Students are encourage to fully investigate their materials during this class. If there is a need for specific assignments this will be done on an individual basis. Students are encouraged to keep drawing journals and start a file of resource material with their paintings in mind. ART-UE 1391 Advanced Projects in Digital Art: \"Mind Remapping\" In this course, students will develop projects that use, critique and expand the notion and boundaries of digital media. The exploration of the mind's own processing of information will be a conceptual foundation for the course as we examine the ways in which digital tools mimic, respond to and amplify human desire. Media in the class will range from images and animation to video and music. The class will be an opportunity to both learn new tools and deepen skills already begun. Projects will be presented and discussed. ART-UE 1393 Advanced Projects in Art &amp; Media: &ldquo;Performance and Photo/Video&rdquo; This class will utilize each student&rsquo;s body in situ or in photography or video to demonstrate issues that transcend the particular aura of the individual and spread ideas into and from culture.

Contemporary art provides an opportunity to reflect on contemporary society and the issues relevant to ourselves, and the world around us. Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced, culturally diverse, and technologically advancing world. Their art is a dynamic combination of materials, methods, concepts, and subjects that challenge traditional boundaries and defy easy definition. Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organizing principle, ideology, or &lsquo;ism.&rsquo; Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.    Critical Pedagogy    Critical pedagogy is a term that applies to a number of educational perspectives that address the issue of power in teaching and learning. Important contributors to these perspectives include Paulo Freire, bell hooks, and Henry Giroux. Critical pedagogy is best understood not as a single theory, but as a range of possible educational responses to social structures and relations that are unequal or oppressive. The &ldquo;critical&rdquo; in critical pedagogy refers to the ability to analyze, expose and challenge the hidden social, cultural and political processes that are a part of knowledge production, including how one&rsquo;s own views and assumptions come from a particular cultural and historical formation. Critical pedagogy encourages educators to not only be aware of injustices but to take action to transform the practices and structures that perpetuate them. Ultimately, critical pedagogy seeks to provide education that is democratic, emancipatory, and empowering to students.    Critical Theory    Critical theory for us describes an interdisciplinary field of study. It provides a way of understanding institutions, such as the art world and education, in terms of the ideas and knowledge they produce and reproduce in our society, which is characterized by the unequal distribution of power. It involves looking at the ideas that shape cultural practices such as visual art, media, advertising and entertainment. Additionally, critical theory enables the examination of particular facets of these practices, such as the nature of representation, artistic authority and voice.    Pedagogy    Pedagogy is the whole art of teaching. Our program looks at the ways in which pedagogy can include making decisions about curriculum, how and in whose interest knowledge is produced and passed on, and what instructional methods best serve both the educator&rsquo;s teaching philosophy and the needs of diverse student populations.    Praxis    Praxis is practice, or action, with the thoughtfulness of reflection. Praxis as an idea emerged from the work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, who described it as &ldquo;reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.&rdquo; (1990, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, p.36). It embodies our belief that theory and practice are not binary opposites, but rather complements that work together to further one&rsquo;s lifelong growth as an artist-educator.    Social Activism    Social activism addresses social, political, cultural, and economic inequities by organizing and connecting individuals with a community-based movement in order to enact social change. While social services address the needs of individuals, social action looks more at the root causes of injustice and tries to find ways to organize communities in an effort to eliminate or overcome those injustices.
