Description       Why do some stories scare us? This course seeks to define and examine fear by reading scary stories defined as gothic. The course begins with the birth of the &quot;Gothic&quot; novel in Great Britain and traces the genre's evolution during the revolutionary turmoil of the 1790s. In addition to reading the gothic as a response to a shifting political landscape, we consider the extent to which the gothic's ability to inspire fear and produce a sensory response relates to the goals of the Enlightenment. How does gothic literature test the limits of empiricism and question the authority of sensory experience? How and why do works of gothic literature succeed in creating fear? We read canonical works of the gothic, including drama, short stories, horror ballads,  and a satirical send-up of the genre . Readings may include M.G. Lewis' The Monk and Castle Spectre, Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, Miles Peter Andrews' The Enchanted Castle, Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher, Washington Irving's Legend of Sleepy Hollow and selected ballads such as &quot;The Children in the Wood,&quot; &quot;Tam Lin,&quot; and &quot;Sweet William's Ghost.&quot;                   Course Type       First-Year Program: Research Seminars (FIRST-UG)                               top of page                                                                   NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

The aim was to offer select freshmen, in their very first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike. The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992 to more than sixty in recent fall semesters. The instructors have been drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.With the launching of the College Cohort Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on individual or group projects.          Computer Simulation   (FRSEM-UA 207; class #7071)   Instructor: Charles S. Peskin   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics      Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course, students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.     CHARLES S. PESKIN is Silver Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science. His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor\u2019s Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.        Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature       (FRSEM-UA 210; class #7072)   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory.     FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.      The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America      (FRSEM-UA 218; class #7073)   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Tuesday, 6:45\u20138:45 p.m. (and several Thursdays in this time slot; see below)   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.       IMPORTANT: Please note amended meeting schedule for this course in the fall 2012 term. Students who are unable to accommodate both the Tuesday and Thursday classes should not register for the course.     Tuesday, September 4   Thursday, September 6   Tuesday, September 11   Thursday, September 20   Tuesday, October 2   Thursday, October 11   Tuesday, October 23   Tuesday, October 30   Tuesday, November 6   Tuesday, November 13   Tuesday, November 20    Last class: Tuesday, November 27     Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level.     JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.      First Amendment Freedom of Expression      (FRSEM-UA 235; class #7074)   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon   Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)    Conflicts over freedom of speech and press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources who provide critical information for a story of national importance. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the sharp disagreements over what freedom of speech and press meant in 1789, even as Madison drafted the amendment. Students will learn about the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. The course will look at freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is an Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. He teaches courses on First Amendment law in which he focuses on freedom of speech and freedom of the press. His most recent book, Ellery\u2019s Protest, tells the story of one of the most controversial Supreme Court cases of the last century, Abington School District v. Schempp, in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in the public schools violated the First Amendment. Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a J.D. at Georgetown University Law Center.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies      (FRSEM-UA 255; class #7075)   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.     ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and has taught in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for Social Work in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.      Disease and History: Epidemics and Pandemics from Antiquity to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 265; class #13807)   Instructor: Richard Hull   Thursday, 11:00 a.m. \u2013 1:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     This seminar focuses on the historical dimensions of several major epidemics that profoundly affected human societies in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students identify each epidemic and explore its causes, origins, means of transmission, efforts at containment, and impacts on societies, particularly on their cultural development. They examine representations of the epidemic in the arts, media, and literature of the period, as well as assess the effects of each disease on demographics, religions, economies, and lifestyles. To what extent did an epidemic, or plague, accelerate or retard fundamental changes in human relationships within societies and between them, and the ways people viewed themselves and their universe? Students read and discuss several core texts and write a short response paper on each. They also write a brief paper on a disease of their choice and discuss their findings in class.     RICHARD HULL is Professor of History. A specialist in African and European history, he is the author of numerous books, including African Cities and Towns, Modern Africa , and Munyakare: African Civilizations , as well as coauthor of the two-volume World Civilizations . He has received both the Great Teacher Award and three Golden Dozen Awards for Teaching Excellence.      Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Duelling with Health Science Information      (FRSEM-UA 278; class #13804)   Instructor: Ralph Katz   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The common citizen is well challenged\u2014if not overly challenged\u2014trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \u201cScientific\u201d health findings of this week seem routinely to conflict with the \u201cscientific\u201d health findings of last week. As the movie theme song first asked so poignantly over three decades ago, \u201cWhat\u2019s it all about, Alfie?\u201d This course explores that question as it relates to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions about health behaviors, and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a framework for understanding this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \u201cinstant, electronic news\u201d world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, truth, polar bears, limes, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \u201cop-ed\u201d article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.     RALPH V.

From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia      (FRSEM-UA 282; class #7076)   Instructor: Edward W. Lehman   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The second decade of the new millennium has dawned with intensifying ideological cleavages in the United States and assertions that we are increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and democratic institutions. Our seminar\u2019s aim is to assess these diagnoses using Amitai Etzioni\u2019s The New Golden Rule as a theoretical template and relying on such analytical dimensions as autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. We first situate American society in the broader context of decisive moral and social transformations which have occurred in Western civilization over the last two thousand years. To that end, our seminar looks at Rodney Stark\u2019s acclaimed The Rise of Christianity , which focuses on formative developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era, and Max Weber\u2019s classic, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism . We then examine social-science analyses of the contemporary American situation, with the help of such books as Habits of the Heart by Robert Bellah and his colleagues. Our final readings are Robert Putnam\u2019s controversial Bowling Alone, which remains the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life, and Claude S. Fischer\u2019s recent Made in America , which paints a much more upbeat picture of what is happening around us.     EDWARD W. LEHMAN is Professor Emeritus of Sociology. His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics , and The Viable Polity. He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations . He has edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology , a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities.      Communications and Human Values      (FRSEM-UA 291; class #7077)   Instructor: Richard D. Heffner   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      This seminar is an intellectual inquiry into the development of American public policy as it relates to mass communications. It is not a practicum, not a \u201chow-to\u201d course about film and television, nor about the media generally. The seminar\u2019s purpose is instead to analyze how much of our sense of what it means to be an American early in the 21st century has been molded by the media\u2014first print and now increasingly electronic\u2014with particular reference to their socializing and value-legitimating content. To learn about and then deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the role of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through class discussion of such readings as Walter Lippmann\u2019s Public Opinion , Robert Merton\u2019s Mass Persuasion , J. S. Mill\u2019s On Liberty , Herman Melville\u2019s Billy Budd , and Neil Postman\u2019s Amusing Ourselves to Death ; of such films as Hearts and Minds, JFK , and Fahrenheit 9/11 ; and of the increasingly unfair and unbalanced rants and raves of America\u2019s newer communications outlets. Finally, class emphasis is placed on analyzing and resolving such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \u201cchilling effect\u201d of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \u201cmobocracy,\u201d with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); the importance of journalistic \u201cprivilege\u201d; and media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).     RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind , which he began over half a century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York\u2019s pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952; Eighth Revised and Updated Edition\u2014with Alexander Heffner\u20142009) and the editor of Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America (1956; reissued 2010). His newest books are a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001) and his paperback edition of As They Saw It\u2026 A Half Century of Conversations from the Open Mind (2003). From 1974 to 1994 Mr. Heffner served as Chairman of the film industry\u2019s voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.      The Crusades and Their Legacy      (FRSEM-UA 296; class #7078)   Instructor: Jill N. Claster   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     The Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters in the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. The unexpected result of the First Crusade was the conquest of lands in the Middle East known as the Latin Kingdom, or Outremer, the lands across the sea. For two hundred years, against all odds, the Crusaders managed to keep some of their newly won lands. They lost more of them with every passing decade, however, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the Middle East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, the background which made it possible for thousands of people for over two centuries to join the crusading movement, and the religious ardor which informed the Crusades. It also focuses on life in the Latin Kingdom in the Holy Land, particularly on the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. Most of all, the course addresses many issues that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the centuries-long legacy of the crusading era.     JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 (2009).

She was the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.      Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?      (FRSEM-UA 306; class #7079)   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30 p.m.-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America\u2019s problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.     JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA returned to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies.

Documentary Theater      (FRSEM-UA 351; class #7081)   Instructor: Carol Martin   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     This course explores the subject matter, history and theoretical discourses surrounding the global occurrence of contemporary theatre of the real, also popularly known as documentary theatre. By analyzing the content, structure and dramatic devices of a number of plays, we will look at the problems and possibilities of the ways in which theatre that cites reality portrays a range of human behavior from everyday life to important political events in the attempt to create and recreate personal, political, and historical realities. Documentary theatre both acknowledges a positivist faith in empirical reality and underscores an epistemological crisis in knowing truth. We will read plays about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, terrorism, the Holocaust, racial clashes, the deposition of Cardinal Law, Oscar Wilde, the murder of Matthew Shepard, Lebanese suicide bombers, the open murder of demonstrators in Greensboro, the cover up of industrial accidents in Poland, honor killings in Holland, and accompanying theoretical essays, as well as look at some performances on video. The questions we will consider include: Can theatre effectively critique social and moral values? What are the implications of the blurring of art and life? Are fiction and nonfiction adequate terms for considering the idea of truth? How might we consider theatre of the real from the vantage point of the contemporary collapse of the distinction between the real, the simulated and the virtual?     CAROL MARTIN is Professor of Drama at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. She writes on documentary theatre, contemporary American and Japanese performance, as well as on performance and globalization. Her essays and interviews have appeared in academic journals in the U.S. and abroad and in the New York Times and have been translated into French, Polish, Chinese, and Japanese. Her most recent book is Dramaturgy of the Real on the World Stage .      Literary Theory and Its Applications      (FRSEM-UA 355; class #7082)   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Students in this seminar will read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the 20th century to the present. They will learn to consider different approaches to literature. They will complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.     JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature.

From Mind to Brain and Back Again      (FRSEM-UA 357; class #16356)   Instructor: Joseph LeDoux   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     What is mind? Is it a system of impulses or something changeable? This paraphrase of a Bart Simpson remark captures one of the great debates in history: to what extent are we hard-wired as opposed to shaped by experience? Several hundred years ago, fundamental questions such as these were addressed by philosophers. The birth of psychology in the late 19th century gave us ways of studying the mind scientifically rather than simply speculating about it. Modern neuroscience gives us a new approach, one in which we use discoveries about the brain to understand who we are and why we are that way. What have we learned? And does this approach enhance (or diminish) our sense of who we are? In this course we address these questions, looking at the issues both historically and in terms of modern discoveries. We use the topic of emotions, and their relation to the brain, as a window on the broader problem of mind and brain.      JOSEPH LEDOUX is a University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, and a member of the Center for Neural Science and of the Department of Psychology at NYU.

The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1590-1680: The Age of Caravaggio and Bernini      (FRSEM-UA 366; class #13805)   Instructor: Guy Walton   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Recent biographies of Caravaggio and Bernini provide the basis for this course, which takes papal patronage of the arts in seventeenth-century Rome as its subject. We will explore the reigns of Sixtus V, Paul V, Urban VIII, Innocent X, and Alexander VII\u2014all \u201cbuilder\u201d popes from a time when Rome was considered the artistic capital of Europe\u2014and the masterpieces of painting, sculpture, architecture and city planning they sponsored. In addition to Caravaggio and Bernini, whose clay models will be exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the fall, we will study (among others) Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. During the first weeks of the semester, students will present short biographies of a number of the outstanding personalities of the Counter Reformation and Baroque, from saints to nobles to prelates. Particular stress will be placed on those messages, religious and secular, that were specifically expressed in the rebuilding of the ancient and early Christian city of Rome and its monuments, including such magisterial works as St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, along with many city squares, churches, monasteries, villas and palaces. These remarkable monuments of art and architecture will provide the subjects for the substantial term papers required for the course at the end of the term.     GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (M.A., Ph.D.).

His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles (London and Chicago 1986).      The Writer in New York      (FRSEM-UA 367; class #8879)   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     New York was once the undisputed capital of American literary life. Taking on the many images and expressions of the writer in New York over the past century and more, this seminar presents the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We read primary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. An important goal of the course is to reach a nuanced historical understanding of our city, acknowledging its peculiar power to erase its own history as it changes and grows. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we will try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.     VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content (2002). His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ, Esquire, Harper\u2019s Magazine, the Nation, the New York Times Magazine, and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.      Welcome to College: The Novel      (FRSEM-UA 371; class #7083)   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we will read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contemporary Ivy League university). We will discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students will write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we will explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.

Lethal Passions: Medea and Her Legacies      (FRSEM-UA 377; class #8167)   Instructor: Liana Theodoratou   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The mythic figure of Medea has held our imagination for nearly 2,500 years. What kind of woman is capable of casting such an enduring spell? Best known as the partner of Jason and the murderer of her own children, Medea has been the name of an exploration into the passion and violence, the devastation and vengeance, the complex relations and modes of betrayal that so often punctuate our everyday existence. She has demanded that we think about the relations between the sexes, the meaning of home and exile, the experience of the foreigner, the ethical and moral dimensions of agency and decisions, and the meaning of motherhood. Because these issues have remained vital, her popularity has outlived the ancient Greek texts in which she was born and has found new expressions in various forms\u2014including tragic drama, poetry, novels, painting, cinema, and music. This course seeks to understand the reasons for her longevity in the rich complexity of her character and actions and to explore the ways in which her story has been revised and recontextualized across the ages for new and different ends. We will consider a range of texts from antiquity to the present in order to think about how they understand the tensions, contradictions, and conflicting desires embodied and enacted in this mesmerizing figure.     LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College\u2019s Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.

The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right      (FRSEM-UA 379; class #7084)   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Tuesday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients\u2019 options and care. Determining how to treat patients correctly and safely is difficult, but figuring out what is right is even harder. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Students submit weekly essays on subjects assigned in class and write a long essay at the end of the semester.     MICHAEL E. MAKOVER, M.D., is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine, Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center, and in active practice of internal medicine and rheumatology.

New York City: A Survey, 1609\u20131898      (FRSEM-UA 383; class #7086)   Instructor: Leo Hershkowitz   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12 p.m.     In this study of New York City, we shall look for answers to several basic questions. For example, how did the city become the \u201cWorld\u2019s Capital\u201d? Why is New York so different from other American cities? Why is it the center of art, music, finance, science? Is New York an American city? How have artists, writers, and travelers viewed New York? How do New Yorkers see New York? What is its future? This is also a voyage into unknown New York by means of archival sources largely overlooked by historians, but which are important to understanding the complexity, as well as the excitement, that is New York history. Many of these primary sources are now in the Tamiment Library at NYU, while others are at the New York Historical Society and such city agencies as the offices of the County Clerk, the Municipal Archives, and Register of New York County. The materials found there are basic to the lectures, discussions, and students\u2019 papers in the class. There will also be a walking tour of lower Manhattan and visits to a number of institutions where archival materials are housed.     LEO HERSHKOWITZ, Professor of History at Queens College, CUNY, has written widely on aspects of New York City history. His work has also included testimony before the U.S. Supreme Court (1997) and consultancy to the New York Attorney General, the County Clerk of New York County, and the Appellate Division of the State of New York, First Department.

Computational Thought      (FRSEM-UA 385; class #7087)   Instructor: Dennis Shasha   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience     Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style will combine straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python). Students will make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, evolutionarily inspired robots, DNA computing, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges.     DENNIS E. SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science. His fields of research include computational biology, technologically enhanced privacy, and pattern matching. On the way to becoming a computer scientist, he studied linguistics, engineering, and philosophy. You can find some of his puzzles on the Scientific American website : www.sciam.com .      Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine &amp; Other Sources      (FRSEM-UA 393; class #7089)   Instructor: Michele Shedlin   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     The purpose of this seminar is to explore the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. To explore these issues, we will focus on readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts. This will guide our discussions on the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. Students will become familiar with conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is continually balanced between suffering and comfort.      MICHELLE SHEDLIN, Ph.D., Professor, NYU College of Nursing, is a medical anthropologist with extensive experience in reproductive health, substance abuse and HIV/AIDS research in Africa, Latin America and the U.S. She has designed and implemented behavioral studies at the community, university and national levels, to inform and evaluate prevention and care.

She maintains adjunct faculty appointments at Columbia University, University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Connecticut. Her publications and reports address HIV risk behavior and care, ethical issues in research and practice, immigrant health, and women\u2019s reproductive decision-making and access to services.      America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II      (FRSEM-UA 405; class #7094)   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving into the conversation current foreign policy issues that are challenging America. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950. Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the activities of the CIA in recent years; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America\u2019s long involvement in the Middle East, including its more than 60-year support for the State of Israel and the alleged influence of the \u201cIsrael Lobby\u201d on U.S. foreign policy; the current U.S. relationship with Iran; how the U.S. may have inflamed the  insurgency in Iraq during the first few years of the war; the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.     JAMES B. SITRICK, ESQ., serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in 70 cities in 40 countries. Previously he served as Chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in America during which time that firm opened the first private law office in the then Soviet Union, in Moscow, in addition to offices in Sydney, Shanghai, Bangkok, Jakarta, Los Angeles, and San Jose.

In addition, he serves as a Trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU.      Branding: People, Places, Things      (FRSEM-UA 422; class #7096)   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     As thinking people, we want to believe that we are resistant to branding and its most obvious tool, advertising. Yet both penetrate: occasionally honestly, sometimes deviously, often entertainingly. How do they do it, even when our guards are up? Why do we revere Apple, feel wary of American Apparel, admire Google, and resent BP? Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us, and companies often don\u2019t really know what works, or how; sometimes, they are just lucky. Brands also have a darker side, according to some social commentators, and may lead to mass consumer hypnosis. This course analyzes what makes brands tick, how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and politicians, taking a short look back at the creation of \u201cObama Nation\u201d and a long look back to 1968, when many of today\u2019s tools were developed. We then cross the moat to our own lives, asking ourselves: how are we perceived? How do we create, change, and live up to our own reputations; that is, our own \u201cbrands\u201d?     RICHARD L.LEWIS is an independent marketing doctor who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime worldwide managing director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, leading the ABSOLUT vodka account, responsible for marketing, strategy, and creative. He has written two bestselling books about advertising, and has also taught at Yale College.      Guitar Heroes (and Heroines): Music, Video Games, and the Nature of Human Cognition      (FRSEM-UA 427; class # 7097)   Instructor: Gary Marcus   Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     A look at music and video games from the perspective of cognitive and evolutionary psychology. Among the questions we consider: Why are human beings so passionate about music and so easily sucked in by video games? Is our love of music the product of natural selection? Can science tell us anything about what works in music and what doesn\u2019t? What is the relationship between music and language? Is there a \u201cuniversal grammar\u201d for music? Will machines ever be able to create satisfying works of music? The primary focus is on the psychology of music, with video games serving as counterpoint. Readings are drawn from a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Written assignments include weekly reaction papers and a final paper proposing a novel experiment.     GARY MARCUS, Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Center for Child Language, is a cognitive scientist interested in the origins and nature of human mental life. His books include The Birth of the Mind: How a Tiny Number of Genes Creates the Complexity of Human Thought; The Norton Psychology Reader ; and Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind .      Trials of the Century      (FRSEM-UA 434; class #7100)   Instructor: Jack Ford   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials. These trials have provided a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are often revealed. This course will offer in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century.\u201d Some, such as the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson trial, will focus on the impact of celebrity on the justice system. Others, such as the trials of the \u201cScottsboro Boys,\u201d will examine the effect of race inside the courtroom. Political issues often find voice in the justice system, as in the case of the \u201cChicago Seven.\u201d And religion, that great uniting and dividing force, played a critical role in the Scopes \u201cMonkey Trial.\u201d Such trials have historically held a mirror up to society and have provided an instructive reflection of what transpires within our courts of law.     JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and a nationally recognized trial attorney who has taught at Yale University and Fordham Law School.

As a trial attorney, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial, one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases, and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s, and authored a number of articles for respected legal publications. He is the recipient of five honorary degrees, recognizing his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service work.      History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.      (FRSEM-UA 437; class #7102)   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.     This course explores the relationship between history and memory, between what we know and how we know what we think we know. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese-Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education , McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. To understand better the lives of those people most affected by acts of injustice, we will read works by such writers as Baldwin, Roth, and Salinger. We will also consider the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.     JACK SALZMAN has been the recipient of a Distinguished Teaching award, and twice has been awarded a Fulbright Professorship. He formerly served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University, and for thirty years was the editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the five-volume Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History .

He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of thirty-five memoirs by Holocaust survivors, and currently is working on a book focusing on the impact the Holocaust had on Jews and social justice in the United States.      The \u201cLong 19th Century\u201d: Sixty Glorious Years, 1876\u20131936      (FRSEM-UA 439; class #13806)   Instructor: Rena Mueller   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The historical narrative of the \u201clong century,\u201d as defined by British historian Eric Hobsbawm, referring to the period between the years 1789 and 1914, has been extended conceptually in the last two decades by the work of Giovanni Arrighi. But this idea of the \u201clong century\u201d when applied to the period 1876-1936 holds for music as well: for comprehensive brilliance and diversity, the period from 1876 to 1936 is unsurpassed in the history of Western music. The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw the composition\u2014and frequently unruly first performances\u2014of Schoenberg\u2019s Second String Quartet, Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht , and Pierrot Lunaire ; of Stravinsky\u2019s Firebird, Petrouchka , and Le Sacre du Printemps ; and the early works of Berg, Webern, and Bart\u00f3k. Richard Strauss\u2019s operas Salome and Elektra jockeyed for place with L\u00e9har\u2019s The Merry Widow and Oscar Straus\u2019s The Chocolate Soldier , among others.   This class will explore the \u201cisms\u201d most often associated with artistic and literary movements but quickly appropriated by music of the time: Romanticism, Post-Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Futurism, Positivism, and Dadaism. Four broad themes\u2014musical musical evolution and revolution, social structure, literary and musical nationalism, and anxiety\u2014will form the core of the class. In particular, we will investigate the two cities where modernism was born but where it was only uncomfortably at home, the polarities of 19th-century literary, artistic, and musical environments in Vienna (the negative \u201cfin-de-si\u00e8cle\u201d) and Paris (the positive \u201cla belle \u00c9poque\u201d), paying special attention to the works of Schnitzler, Freud, Jarry, Apollinaire, the Sezession, Der Blaue Reiter, Die Br\u00fccke, the Bauhaus, the Fauves, L\u2019art nouveau, and Cubism.

Virtue/Success/Happiness: Business in U.S. Literature      (FRSEM-UA 440; class # 7103)   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Monday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through the study of stories, novels, nonfiction, and film from 1776 to the present, we study the evolution of attitudes among some of the most engaging American writers to the central ideas of business. What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic developed? We examine what writers such as Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, and James thought about the American business of \u201cgetting and spending,\u201d and how Stowe and Twain reacted to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons\u201d of the Gilded Age, the rise of the corporation at the end of the century, and the enormous influx of immigration into American cities that fed the growth of capitalism shortly afterwards. In the 20th century, what do films like Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead tell us about how the connections between virtue, success, and happiness have developed? The course finishes with reflections on what conclusions we can draw from the recent financial crisis for our theme.     SAUL ROSENBERG, who holds a Ph.D. in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge, has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He has also been a consultant at McKinsey and Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he now manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal .      Three Moments in Witchcraft      (FRSEM-UA 441; class #7104)   Instructor: Laura Levine   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     In I Samuel 28, when King Saul wants to know what to do about the army of Philistines gathering at his door, he seeks out the witch of Endor to conjure up the dead Samuel to answer his questions. Renaissance commentators puzzled over what it is that the witch summoned up: a devil? The real Samuel? \u201cAn illusion\u201d says Reginald Scot in his Discoverie, the first book in the period to offer a theory of witch-hunts as scapegoating. For him, the witch of Endor was a ventriloquist. King James I of England also saw the scene as one of theater, but for him it was the devil playing Samuel. What lies at the root of the association between witchcraft and theater during the period? When Spenser has his heroes in Book I of The Faerie Queene strip the witch Duessa to look at her naked body, how is he commenting on the theatricality of judicial procedures? Why does The Winter\u2019s Tale \u2019s Leontes throw Paulina out of his chambers as a \u201cmankind witch\u201d? This course seeks to answer such questions, beginning with the Bible, focusing on the Renaissance and ending with the story of a mouse who was a witch and Balanchine\u2019s re-creation of the moment as a ballet.     LAURA LEVINE is an Associate Professor of Theater Studies in Drama at Tisch, where she teaches courses in Shakespeare, Renaissance studies, and autobiography and solo performance.

Truth and Sedition from Galileo to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 442; class #16512)   Instructor: William Klein   Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of truth change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes themselves implicates modes of knowing (as it did in the case of Galileo)? Are there truths that any regime would\u2014or should\u2014find dangerous? What are the possible motives for self-censorship? Beginning with the persecution of Galileo for his attack on Aristotelian doctrine, and ending with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes (from textbooks to cartoons to search engines), we will consider these questions in relation to select philosophic and literary analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, and \u017di\u017eek.     WILLIAM KLEIN studied the history of political theory under J.G.A. Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and has served on the editorial review board of The Journal of the History of Philosophy . At NYU, he teaches the history of political discourse in Liberal Studies, and conducts seminars on a variety of topics for the honors program in CAS. He is currently writing a study on the history and theory of sedition. In previous lives he worked as a ghost writer, an editor and a carpenter (hence the title of a recent piece on one of Italy's great artists, Franca Ghitti: \"Naive Notes on Franca's Nails by a Former Carpenter\"). In 2011-12 he taught for NYU in Florence.       Financial Systems as Social Forms: Comparing Conventional and Islamic Finance      (FRSEM-UA 444; class #8203)   Instructor: Mary Poovey   Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Financial systems direct the flow of capital between savers and borrowers, but they also reflect and help shape contemporary values and understandings of the self and others. In this course we compare and contrast the theories implicit in the financial systems of the United States and most other Western countries and those implicit in  Islamic financial institutions, which now exist in many parts of the world. The most basic distinction between the two systems involves assumptions about the economy and the individuals who participate in it. In the US, the economy is assumed to govern itself by the law of supply and demand, and individuals are assumed to be rational agents who seek to maximize their own profit and minimize personal loss. Credit\u2014and therefore debt\u2014is central to the US economy because interest-based financing is the primary mechanism for transferring money from one party to another.      In Islamic finance, by contrast, commercial transactions are governed by Shari\u2019ah law because the economy, like every other facet of life, is subject to the commands of Allah and because human reason is considered fallible. While Shari\u2019ah law bans one fundamental part of the US system\u2014interest\u2014it does recognize the principle of profit and loss sharing, and special financial instruments have been developed to enable individuals and institutions to form partnerships, transfer capital, and generate profits.      By comparing these two systems and the practices they require, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in an increasingly interconnected global context.       MARY POOVEY is the Samuel Rudin University Professor in the Humanities and Professor of English at New York University. She received a Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence from the College, and she was also recognized for excellence in teaching by Swarthmore College. She has published books and articles on subjects ranging from feminist theory to the history of bookkeeping and statistics. This course grows out of her current project, which is a co-authored book exploring the ways financial instruments and institutions shape the ways their users understand themselves and interact with the world.      From St. Petersburg to Paris and New York: George Balanchine and the Politics of Modernism      (FRSEM-UA 445; class #8204)   Instructor: Jennifer Homans   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course is a biography of modernism, told through the life and work of the ballet master George Balanchine. We trace Balanchine\u2019s path and artistic development from his birth in Imperial St. Petersburg in 1904 through the political and artistic tumult of the Russian Revolution, to Paris in the 1920s, where he collaborated with Serge Diaghilev and artists, dancers, and composers working at the forefront of modernism. From 1933 until his death in 1983, Balanchine lived in New York, where he and other \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists transformed the cultural life of the city. What did Balanchine\u2019s dances have to do with the political culture of Petersburg, Paris and New York? Can we trace the relationship between his life and his art?     Readings will range from history to memoir and biography. Students will also attend live performances and study dances and other forms of art at Lincoln Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Guggenheim Museum of Art. Grades will be based on weekly writing assignments, class participation, and an in-class presentation analyzing a dance or other work of art in its historical context.     JENNIFER HOMANS is the author of Apollo\u2019s Angels: A History of Ballet (2010) and the dance critic for the New Republic . She has also published with the New York Times, the New York Review of Books , and the Guardian , among others.

She was trained at the North Carolina School of the Arts and the School of American Ballet, and performed with the Chicago Lyric Opera Ballet and the Pacific Northwest Ballet. She has danced a wide repertory ranging from the 19th-century classics to works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and contemporary choreographers.      Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature      (FRSEM-UA 449; class #13813)   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through thematic analyses of books and films by topic and genre, this seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War-era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. We will examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Phillip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we will look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.     EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian who also teaches at Yale College. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

He received his BA from Columbia College and his JD from NYU Law School and is also an attorney specializing in Corporate Restructuring.      \u201cLaboratories for Democracy\u201d: Making American Cities Better      (FRSEM-UA 456; class #8256)   Instructor: Eric Gioia   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     At a time when many Americans have become increasingly frustrated with what government has produced, there are places that are getting it done right. Cities, states and municipalities serve as what Justice Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. From fighting crime in the streets of New York City, to banning smoking in bars and restaurants, to making the power grid more efficient, to encouraging the arts and culture in urban environments, innovations in American cities have spread across the globe. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action. We study best practices from around the country (and the world), evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.     ERIC GIOIA, ESQ. is an attorney with over eleven years of experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P.

Literature, Economics, and History in 18th-Century Britain      (FRSEM-UA 460; class #8941)   Instructor: Kevin Brine   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Few authors have had more influence on modern thought than Adam Smith, Samuel Johnson, and Edward Gibbon. Smith defined the terms by which we understand modern economics; Johnson taught us how to read English literature; and Gibbon pointed the way to modern historiography with an account of the Roman Empire that has never been surpassed. All three were members of the same Literary Club, founded by Johnson and the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1764. In 1791, Club member James Boswell published the remarkable biography Life of Johnson , which vividly portrays the intellectual life of Georgian Britain through an astounding wealth of anecdotes, intellectual repartee, and the personal details of an unforgettable and larger-than- life Samuel Johnson. In this course we read selections from Life of Johnson , Smith\u2019s The Wealth of Nations (1776), and Gibbon\u2019s The Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire (1776), with an eye toward the contemporary relevance of these works. Students come to know Samuel Johnson as though he were a family friend, gain a deep understanding of Adam Smith\u2019s concept of how a modern economy works, and see the ancient grandeur of Rome through the eyes of one of the world\u2019s most influential historians. Working in small groups, students learn to present their ideas in a seminar setting and improve their writing skills with assignments geared toward expressing their ideas and insights.     KEVIN R.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber      (FRSEM-UA 461; class #8960)   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English.     JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s (2002).

Oral History of Irish America      (FRSEM-UA 462; class #8971)   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. -12:00 noon    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an interdisciplinary approach to documenting the lived experience of Irish Americans and their communities in a small class setting. The course reviews the methodology of oral history, its significance as a resource, its role in historical research, specific interviewing and research techniques, and the opportunity to create an original public history document that will be deposited in the Archives of Irish America at NYU for use by scholars in a variety of research projects. Students will be assigned an interview subject chosen from the Irish American community in New York City. To date we have interviewed parish priests from the Bronx, an Oscar and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and director, a National Book Award-winning novelist, as well as actors, musicians, teachers, and Wall Street executives. In addition to the interview, the course includes classroom lectures, readings, and extensive writing exercises. The final project (which will undergo careful editing and numerous rewrites) includes a biography and full finding aid to the interview for the archive, as well as web content that will be launched on the Glucksman Ireland House Oral History website. This course offers real world experience and communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout students\u2019 academic and professional careers.     LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Specializing in twentieth-century immigration, Professor Almeida has focused primarily on the \u201cNew Irish\u201d of the 1980s and 90s, publishing chapters in The Irish World Wide (1992), Ireland in the 1950s (2004), and Making the Irish American (2006). Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 (2001) compared those who arrived in the 1950s with their counterparts thirty and forty years later. She has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives.      Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\"      (FRSEM-UA 463; class #14260)   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      In contemporary war, \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions--the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed: politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.      SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival (The Smile of the Lamb), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director (Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival (You Can Thank Me Later).

He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA).      Literature of the Absurd      (FRSEM-UA 464; class #14251)   Instructor: Thomas Bishop   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The absurd sensibility has profoundly marked writers of many countries and languages since the start of the 20th century. The notion of the absurd is most closely associated with the Theater of the Absurd, launched in the 1950's in Paris by, notably, Beckett and Ionesco, and continued world-wide by such playwrights as Pinter, Albee, Havel, Stoppard, and Frisch. But the preoccupation with the absurd was not limited to the theater; in the immediate post-World War II period, the Existentialists already had posited the absurdity of human\u2019s condition on this earth and works by Sartre and Camus brilliantly explored this philosophic position. The metaphysical anguish at the base of absurdist attitudes stemmed from what Martin Esslin, the author of the landmark Theater of the Absurd, called the disappearance of \u201cthe certitudes and unshakable basic assumptions of former ages [which were] swept away\u2026found wanting\u2026and discredited.\u201d Kafka\u2019s work is exemplary and the seminal depiction of the absurd for his century; many other writers view the world as fundamentally absurd, including Pirandello, Stein, Gombrowicz, Grass, Heller, Cort\u00e1zar, Vonnegut, Pynchon, Kertesz. Many filmmakers shared these perspectives, including Antonioni, Resnais, Godard, and more recently, Woody Allen. In a century that witnessed two unbelievably destructive worldwide conflicts, an era that made possible the Holocaust and other genocides, that produced Hiroshima and with it human\u2019s ability for the first time of destroying itself and the entire world, it is no surprise that the absurd would be a dominant stance, even if the absurd if often treated with devastating humor.   TOM BISHOP is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature, and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization.

Dostoyevsky: Modernity and the Novel      (FRSEM-UA 466; class #14269)   Instructor: Ilya Kriger   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will examine Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction as a particularly helpful prism for understanding the conditions, experience and philosophical ramifications of modernity. The novel is often understood as the genre best capable of representing and reckoning with the complexities of modern life. This is, in fact, how Dostoevsky himself understood his mission as a novelist. Following his cue, then, we will try to understand what it is about his writing that is specifically modern. Readings of Dostoevsky\u2019s novels, early as well as late, will be supplemented by a number of canonical statements about the modern. Readings from Dostoevsky will include Poor People, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov . Supplementary readings from Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Benjamin, Mikhail Bakhtin and others.      ILYA KLIGER is assistant professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at NYU. His primary interests include the nineteenth-century novel in Russia and France as well as literary and critical theory. His first book explores the parallel developments of the notions of temporality in nineteenth-century novelistic and philosophical works. His more recent projects have involved exploring tragic patterns in the tradition of the Russian novel.      The Statue of Liberty: Icon of America      (FRSEM-UA 467; class #14253)   Instructor: Edward Berenson   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The Statue of Liberty is perhaps the most beloved of all American symbols. Yet no one living in 1885, when the crated monument arrived in New York Harbor, could have foreseen the central place the Statue of Liberty would come to occupy in the American imagination. Most Americans had never heard of the French intellectuals who proposed to build it, and many thought the whole idea presumptuous and bizarre. The statue\u2019s supporters feared it would never go up. The course will begin with Liberty\u2019s uncertain origins in French art and politics and then consider the trials of its reception and construction in New York Harbor. We will see how the statue\u2019s symbolically indistinct, neoclassical form has allowed Americans to interpret its meaning in diverse ways: as representing the emancipation of the slaves, Tocqueville's ideal of orderly liberty, opportunity for \"huddled masses,\" and, in the years since 9/11, the freedom and resilience of the United States and New York City in the face of terror. We will also examine the statue\u2019s prominent role in American popular culture. About midway through the semester, the class will take the ferry to Liberty Island and climb to the statue\u2019s crown.     EDWARD BERENSON is professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at NYU. In 1999, he won the American Historical Association\u2019s Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award. He is the author or editor of six books, the most recent of which are Heroes of Empire: Five Charismatic Men and the Conquest of Africa (2010) and The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story (2012).       Schools in the Greek and Roman World      (FRSEM-UA 468; class #14255)   Instructor: Raffaella Cribiore   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      This course will give students knowledge of ancient schooling in the Greek and Roman worlds and will cover liberal arts education (in its three levels, primary, grammatical, and rhetorical) and schools of medicine. Some scholars have recently maintained that the network of schools in the ancient world was so puny that the levels of illiteracy were extremely high. Yet it is important to take into account that it is difficult to identify schools because they were usually not housed in buildings designated for this purpose, often occupied private quarters, and education went on in the open air or within the family. At the end of the course students will realize that much caution is needed in evaluating education in the ancient world.     The course will be based on the literary sources, the school exercises from Greek and Roman Egypt, and on archaeological sources. Students will examine evidence regarding schools that have recently come to light in Rome and Greek Alexandria. They will pay special attention to the Greek school found in Egypt in the Dakhla Oasis through the excavation sponsored by New York University.     RAFFAELLA CRIBIORE is a professor in the Department of Classics and is considered an expert in ancient education. His first book was Writing, Teachers and Students in Greco-Roman Egypt (Scholars Press 1996), which contained a catalogue of 406 school exercises that emerged from the sands of Egypt. This book was followed by Gymnastics of the Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt (Princeton 2001). This book was awarded the Goodwin Prize in 2003, the most prestigious award in the field of Classics. In 2006, Professor Cribiore wrote, in collaboration with Roger Bagnall, Women\u2019s Letters from Ancient Egypt, 300BC-AD 800 (Michigan University Press). In 2007 he published again with Princeton University Press The School of Libanius in Late Antique Antioch , which studied a very prestigious school of rhetoric in Syria.      Pagans and Christians in Roman Egypt      (FRSEM-UA 469; class #14256)   Instructor: Nicola Aravecchia   Friday, 9:30-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This course explores the subject of paganism in late Roman Egypt and the role that Christianity played in shaping a new religious, social, and cultural environment between the third and sixth centuries CE. The goal is to gain an understanding of the process by which the new religion spread in a heavily Hellenized part of the Mediterranean world, influenced by Classical culture and religious beliefs but also attached to its traditional religious heritage. The seminar will touch upon issues of religious and cultural resistance, imperial involvement, official propaganda, proselytism, and syncretic manifestations of devotional practice. Attention will also be paid to the variety of forms in which Christianity (and modes of Christian life) developed in Egypt, expressive of a complex but deeply fascinating world of ideas and beliefs. The religious topography of pre-Christian Egypt, in which temples were prime visual landmarks, will be examined and compared with the dramatic changes brought by the appearance and dissemination of Christian places of cult and monastic life.     NICOLA ARAVECCHIA is Clinical Assistant Professor of Archaeology at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World and the academic director of New York University\u2019s semester abroad program in Egypt. His research interests concern Egypt in Late Antiquity and focus on the origins and development of Early Christian art and architecture in that region of the Mediterranean world. He also has a strong interest in the application of models of spatial analysis to archaeology, with the goal of studying how public and private spaces were constructed and used in antiquity and how they affected social relationships. He is the field director of the archaeological mission of Ain el-Gedida, a fourth-century settlement in the Dakhla Oasis of Upper Egypt, where he has been excavating since 2006. Currently, he is working on the final archaeological report of the 2006-2008 excavation seasons. He is also the deputy field director of the archaeological mission of Amheida in the Dakhla Oasis.      Picasso: Poetry and Invention      (FRSEM-UA 470; class #14257)   Instructor: Pepe Karmel   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Pablo Picasso is widely recognized as the greatest artist of the 20th century. But what is it that makes his work so powerful and influential? This seminar will explore Picasso\u2019s achievement in depth, looking at paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints from all eight decades of his career. On one hand, we will look at the astonishing series of new formal languages that he invented between 1907 through 1957. On the other, we will look at Picasso\u2019s remarkable work as a figurative storyteller and poet, exploring the fundamental human emotions of joy and sorrow, love and desire, alienation and aggression. Along with texts by biographers, critics, and art historians, we will read works by poets such as, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Cocteau, and Paul Eluard,who were his closest friends.      PEPE KARMEL teaches in the Department of Art History, New York University. His book, Picasso and the Invention of Cubism , was published by Yale University Press in 2003.

He is currently working on a history of abstract art.       A Nation of War      (FRSEM-UA 471; class #14398)   Instructor: Nikhil Singh   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore a controversial proposition: to what extent is the US a nation defined by commitments to and capacities for making war? Coming of age in the years since 9/11, many of you will not have known a time when the nation was not at war.      We will explore societal interests and attitudes that sustain an interest in war. For example, wars are commonly presented to the general public as necessary to preserve security, and ironically as a means toward peace. In the 1950s President Eisenhower warned of the rise of a \u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d that grew independent of any strategic or security interest. Some have argued that recent wars have been motivated by struggles over resources, particularly oil.      In the contemporary moment, publics are shielded from the consequences of war and thus may have different perspectives from combatants, soldiers and casualties of war. Wars can both unify a people and sharpen domestic political conflicts and societal divisions.      We will use selected course readings and documentary screenings to explore a range of social, philosophical and personal standpoints on America\u2019s wars past, present and future in an effort to answer an age-old question: \u201cwar, what is it good for?\u201d     NIKHIL PAL SINGH is Associate Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and History. He is a recent winner of NYU\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. teaching award.

He is the author of the prize-winning book, Black is a Country: Race and the Unfinished Struggle for Democracy , and is currently completing a work entitled Exceptional Empire: Race and War in US Globalism .      21st Century Literature: Methods, Materials, Maps      (FRSEM-UA 473; class #14399)   Instructor: Elaine Freedgood   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will read a selection of novels, poetry, and journalism written in the last twelve years that will help us explore the issues raised in the course\u2019s subtitle: \u201cmethods, materials and maps.\u201d The methods writers use in the twenty-first century to depict internal and external worlds, including realism, postmodernism, digital operations of chance and data mining, and poetry deviate significantly from our ideas of the lyric and the personal. Materials include illustrations\u2014the graphic novel and the comic, the artist\u2019s book, electronic media, and self-published zines. What is the geography of current world literature? What is global and/or local about it? The course will include \u201cfield trips\u201d to poetry and prose readings, book stores, and exhibits of printed and digital matter. Writers will include Indra Sinha, Chris Ware, Young Hae-Chang, Orhan Pamuk, Maureen McLane, Ian MacEwan, Karenn Tei Yamashita, Jesmyn Ward, Dexter Filkins, and Ed Roberson.      ELAINE FREEDGOOD is the author of Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World (Cambridge 2000) and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (Chicago 2006), and also the editor of Factory Production in Victorian Britain (Oxford 2003). She is currently working on a book about fictionality, reference and metalepsis.      What is College For?      (FRSEM-UA 474; class #14400)   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open minded person? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career after graduation? To have a fun social life and make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and societal goals of higher education. It will also prompt you to be more reflective and purposeful about your own academic choices during your time as an NYU student. At the beginning of the 21st century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. During the semester we will study issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience. Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? Will new technologies change how professors teach and how students learn? Finally \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 how can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment?     TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Associate Professor and Associate Director of the Morse Academic Plan, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.      Why Lincoln Matters: Re-Envisioning the Politically Possible      (FRSEM-UA 475; class #14401)   Instructor: Philip Kunhardt   Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How was a man with less than a year of formal education able to become one of the nation\u2019s most salient political actors? Coinciding with the 2012 presidential election, and with the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, this seminar will involve students in an exploration of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s transformative leadership, a touchstone for all subsequent American presidencies. In an effort to understand why his memory still matters, and what contemporary political leaders can learn from his example, we will examine Lincoln\u2019s core writings and speeches for historical context, literary and political merit, and impact on the thinking of the American public. We will look at Lincoln\u2019s role in the Civil War, his use of political rhetoric, and his impact upon American civil liberties. How did the issues of slavery and race intersect with his development as a public figure? How was he influenced by other figures around him\u2014southerners, abolitionists, former slaves, and social conservatives? And how did he learn to use words so effectively to help produce social transformation? Lessons and warnings applicable to today will enter into our intensive group discussion. In papers and presentations students will examine aspects of presidential leadership of most interest to them and develop their writing and communication skills. In addition to Lincoln\u2019s published words, drawn from Roy Basler, Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings , texts will include David H. Donald, Lincoln ; Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial: Lincoln and Slavery ; ibid, Our Lincoln ; James Oakes, The Radical and the Republican ; Douglas Wilson, Honor\u2019s Voice ; and ibid, Lincoln\u2019s Sword . Students may also read a book on the American presidency as an institution, and on Barack Obama and/or his opposing candidate in the 2012 elections.

Swing Counties 2012: The Bush-Obama America      (FRSEM-UA 479; class #16513)   Instructor: David Dent   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     George Bush and Barack Obama are two very different leaders. Yet they have 272 counties in common. George Bush won those counties in 2000 and 2004 and Barack Obama won them in 2008. This course explores American politics and the electoral process through the prism of swing counties and voters. How do such voters and counties exist in this age of ideological polarization? Readings will include Dreams from My Father, Red State Blue State , among other articles and books that explore swing voters. Students will write two Op Ed pieces related to the concept of swing voters and complete a final project.      DAVID J.

Gender, Sexuality and the Law      (FRSEM-UA 480; class #16699)   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? We will explore gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce and, for example, family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law, as is well known, treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, prostitution, in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. For purposes of law, is discrimination against LGBT subjects best understood as analytically or socially distinct from sex-based discrimination? What's the relationship between sex stereotyping and homophobia? This course offers a history of U.S. sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments.     SHELLEY D. FISCHEL, ESQ., served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009.

Cannibalism      (FRSEM-UA 481; class # 16700)   Instructor: Dylon Robbins   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Western thought teaches us that people who eat people are \u201cbad.\u201d Indeed, the notion of cannibalism is a recurring concern in the history of ideas regarding the primitive, the animalistic, the monstrous, or any of the other classifications frequently invoked to mark others, regardless of their actual culinary preferences. An extended reflection on cannibalism as an intellectual phenomenon suggests how people eating people, or at least the possibility of it, says a great deal about those that do not. Interesting, as well, is the fact that, in some regions of the Caribbean and Brazil, ideas regarding cannibalism have made an important turn, such that the cannibal has become a provocative affirmation of self. The aim of this course is to think about cannibalism, not, as it often is, as a theme for anthropologists and ethnographers, but rather as an intellectual problem that has enjoyed a very long life in the history of ideas about self. In this course, we shall revisit a selection of texts regarding cannibalism from Columbus\u2019 diaries to the present, and including many noteworthy and fascinating interventions about the idea of cannibalism by, among others, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Cabeza de Vaca, Hans Staden, Goya, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar, Oswald de Andrade, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, and Juan Jos\u00e9 Saer.

Audiovisual Stories: Creative Documentary Filmmaking in Latin America (2000\u20132012)      (FRSEM-UA 483; class #17048)   Instructor: Alexandra Falek   Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Creative documentaries present their subject in a poetic manner; they experiment with the formal and conceptual possibilities of storytelling by proposing an artistic engagement and (re)presentation of the questions, problems and ideas they explore. In Latin America, they are a vital part of long-standing film traditions. This seminar offers students the opportunity to acquire practical and perceptive skills related to the interpretation and analysis of recent creative documentaries made by renowned and new directors. We will examine the use and construction of storytelling elements (visual, aural, emotional, narrative, structural) in each film, always considering pertinent issues related to the film\u2019s particular production, exhibition and distribution contexts. As a way of building a strong foundation for the notions of \u201ccreativity\u201d and \u201cpoetry\u201d in filmmaking, we will make regular reference to seminal essays on classic documentary approaches and strategies. Students will develop critical proficiency by watching films on a regular basis, reading relevant texts by filmmakers, theorists and critics, and writing short exercises and a final project.     ALEXANDRA FALEK has been teaching at NYU since 2001 in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese Languages and Literatures, first as a doctoral student and since 2008, as an Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow. She was the co-director of Latin American Film Festival at NYU (2011) and the director of Uruguay Film Fest (2011). Her most recent teaching, research and publication explorations focus on documentary filmmaking in Latin America.      Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 484; class #17214)   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship \u2013 the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Other topics will include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of how New York City is an international city that has turned diversity into strength. The seminar will bring in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and ask how your own actions \u2013 ranging from activism to business leadership \u2013 may affect change that impacts those outside of your immediate world. Who is a truly global citizen: Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, or Hillary Clinton? How would we assess their reach? How do you decenter your perspective and see the world from another point of view? As part of the seminar we will travel to NYU\u2019s Constance Milstein and Family Global Academic Center in Washington, D.C., to visit an international organization, NGO, or federal agency that is engaged globally.     ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost for Globalization and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004.

He has published widely on photography and co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice, cross-listed in four NYU departments and two schools.      See It, Read It: Photography and Writing in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 486; class #17131)   Instructor: Lourdes D\u00e1vila   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What is a photograph? How do we read photographs? How has photography shaped history and fiction, our ideas of the self and of others? The purpose of this course is to analyze the history of photography and its relation with textual productions in XX and XXI century Latin American writers. We will begin by studying how the technology of photography (which arrived in Latin America almost simultaneously with its creation in Europe) contributed to a particular visual construction of Latin America and was incorporated into literary writings from the Caribbean, Central America, and the Southern Cone. The main objective of the course will be to analyze the use of photography in literary and extra-literary texts, from texts that use photography as its discursive axis (but without containing real photographs) to texts that play on the page with photographic reproductions. Topics includ: photography and history, photography and archive, photography and madness, photography and the city, photography and memory, and photography and eroticism. We will consider texts and photographs by Roberto Arlt, Leopoldo Lugones, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Elena Poniatowska, Mario Bellatin, Ana Mar\u00eda Berecochea, and Paz Err\u00e1zuriz, among others. As we explore how literary authors manipulate photographs on the page or collaborate with photographers, we will look at other international writers, such as W. G. Sebald. This course will count toward the major in Spanish and Latin American Studies in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.     LOURDES D\u00c1VILA is a member of the faculty of Spanish and Portuguese and a Golden Dozen Teaching Award winner. Since the 1980s, she has written and published widely on Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s writing, from Hopscotch to Buenos Aires Buenos Aires to Fantomas Against the Multinational Vampires . Her first book, The Image Arrives on a Verbal Shore , focuses on Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s use of visual language. She is is finishing a book on photography and literature in Latin America, is the editor of the forthcoming essay collection La variable Bellatin , and has worked as a translator since the early eighties, both in the field of art and in literature. Her two latest literary translations are Corner of the Dead , (English to Spanish), a short novel by award-winner Lynn Lurie about the Shining Path in Peru, and Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Silvalandia (Spanish to English).       The Past\u2019s Presence      (FRSEM-UA 487; class #17132)   Instructor: Elizabeth McHenry   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How do we remember the past? And what do we learn from it? This course will take up questions of remembering, reflecting on, and writing the past through three lenses. We will begin the semester by reading a selection of African American authors who recast narratives of slavery in contemporary literature. Reading these \u201cneo-slave narratives\u201d will allow us to think about the ways history can be retold in imaginative ways and to explore the complex relationship between nostalgia and critique embodied in the return to the sites of slavery. We will also read works of narrative history and \u201cexperimental\u201d history as a way to think through what counts as meaningful scholarship, whether literary or historical. Finally, students will embark on hands-on research projects of their own design, viewing the past through the authors, texts, locations or institutions that can be recovered by examining primary and archival sources available digitally and/or in New York City. This is a course for those interested in honing their skills as critical readers, original researchers, and persuasive writers, and for those interested in the process of reading, research and writing, their joys and their frustrations.     ELIZABETH MCHENRY, Associate Professor of English, is the author of Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies , which received the John Hope Franklin Book Award, the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing Book History Award, and the American Library Association Award for Non-Fiction. She is the recipient of fellowships from the Ford Foundation and the National Humanities Center, and is currently a co-editor of the New York University Press series, America and the Long Nineteenth Century . Her research interests and teaching are primarily focused on American and African American literary history, print culture studies, and archival research methods.       Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism      (FRSEM-UA 488; class #17133)   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course will study the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in paint, harnessing religious and Roman mythological symbolism to give visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. To understand these portraits in their original context, the modern viewer must become familiar with the debates that preoccupied 17th century European courts: religious controversies of the Reformation; dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. Understanding an artist\u2019s position at a royal court and knowledge of the pre-existing traditions of royal imagery is also essential.     WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.      Haiti Today: Culture, Politics, and Crisis      (FRSEM-UA 489; class #17139)   Instructor: Katherine Smith   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the historical, political, and cultural forces that shape life in Haiti today. Our readings will place Haitian economic development, environment, religion, and culture in a global context. We will focus primarily on the period from the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 to the present. The struggle to realize a system of democratic governance has characterized this period of Haitian history. More recently, Haiti has faced the challenges of rebuilding the material and social infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake of 2010. This has been an unprecedented period of crisis for a nation whose past has always been difficult. In this course we will give particularly close attention to how Haitians understand their world today as conveyed through artistic, literary, historical, and anthropological lenses.     KATHERINE SMITH focuses her research on religious frameworks for understanding displacement, death, and regeneration in the Caribbean. She has studied urban Vodou and contemporary Haitian art for more than ten years. Through extensive ethnographic research, Katherine's dissertation examined historical transformations of the trickster spirit Gede in visual and embodied cultures of Vodou. She is presently revising that work for publication as a book. Katherine spent two years at Brown University as a Mellon-Cogut Postdoctoral Fellow in Africana Studies and History of Art and Architecture. While at Brown, she co-curated a major exhibition on Haitian art titled Reframing Haiti: Art, History, and Performativity. An edited volume based on that exhibition will be published in 2013. Katherine is also on the curatorial team for an exhibition titled In Extremis: Meditations on Death and Rebirth in 21st Century Haitian Art, which will open in September 2012 at the UCLA Fowler Museum.      Feeling Beauty: Aesthetics and Cognitive Science      (FRSEM-UA 492; class # 17191)   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Monday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Why do the arts\u2014as diverse as they are in form and in the modes by which they appeal to body and mind\u2014move us as powerfully as they do? This course explores this question from three perspectives: from that of the philosophical tradition of aesthetics, from that of cognitive neuroscience, and from the that of the arts themselves. Students will read Plato, Kant, Burke, Keats, Elizabeth Bishop, as well as work by neuroscientists, and will engage works of music and of visual art.     G. Gabrielle Starr is Associate Professor of English and Acting Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the  aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. In addition, Dean Starr has just completed a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts.       SPRING 2013       Word and Image      (FRSEM-UA 399; class # 12920)   Instructor: Mark Podwal   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 10:00-11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This art history survey explores the interplay between the verbal and visual. The Second Commandment, which some say bans all figurative art, has been interpreted in ways far less literal and more ambiguous. With the invention of the printing press, pictures were characteristically regarded as less important than texts. Nowadays, there is much less distinction between the realms of the verbal and visual. In the 1970s, the Op-Ed page of the New York Times set editorial illustration in a new direction: a symbiosis of word and image. The \u201ciconotext,\u201d a genre in which neither image nor text is free from the other, includes one-panel cartoons, children\u2019s picture books and graphic novels such as Art Spiegleman\u2019s Maus . Words are frequently featured in modern art from the Cubist collages of Picasso to the stenciled letters of Jasper Johns. Although it has been more common for words to inspire images, at times images have inspired words. E. B. White\u2019s poem, I Paint What I See, parodies the controversy over Diego Rivera\u2019s mural in Rockefeller Center. Leonard Shlain in The Alphabet versus the Goddess proposes that literacy reinforced the brain\u2019s predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the iconic feminine right side. Readings include All the Art That\u2019s Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn\u2019t): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page by Jerelle Kraus; The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe; and Leonardo and a Memory of His Childhood by Sigmund Freud. Relevant gallery and museum visits will be assigned.     MARK PODWAL, Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at the NYU School of Medicine, pursues a parallel career as an artist. For 38 years, his drawings appeared on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times . He is the author and illustrator of numerous books as well as the illustrator of books by Elie Wiesel and Harold Bloom. His art is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Library of Congress. He has received awards from the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Newspaper Design, and the French government named him an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Moreover, he was the first recipient of the NYU School of Medicine Alumnus Medicine in the Humanities Award. His documentary film House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was broadcast this year on PBS.      Drama Criticism: In History and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 459, class # 12923)   Instructor: Ethan Youngerman   Thursday, 2:00 \u2013 4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     The history of theater criticism begins with an obscure newspaperman named Aristotle. Ever since, writers have struggled to capture performance on the page. This craft requires, among other things, a basic knowledge of all aspects of theater\u2014after all, how else can we assess something as complex and collaborative as a play's production? Put another way: how do we know the difference between an amazing actor and an amazingly written part (or between a bad actor and a good actor laboring under horrible direction)? Readings to help us grapple with these questions include many of the great modern theater reviewers (Richard Gilman, Stark Young, Frank Rich, Stanley Kauffmann, Eric Bentley, George Jean Nathan), as well as reviews written by playwrights and poets (everyone from George Bernard Shaw and David Mamet to Dorothy Parker). We also read and workshop the reviews of New York's newest theater critics: you. Students review four current New York theater productions, as well as write a critical research essay. In this way, we study the history of theater reviews so that we can get better at writing them ourselves, and we write them ourselves so that we can better understand their history.     ETHAN YOUNGERMAN is the Director of Writing The Essay in Goddard Residential College and a Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program, where he's won departmental awards for Excellence in Teaching every year since he joined the faculty a decade ago. He's also a playwright and his plays have been workshopped or produced at numerous theaters, including: Manhattan Theatre Club, The Living Theater, and The Hangar Theatre. His play, The Sublet Experiment , ran for over six months in actual New York City apartments, receiving positive dramatic criticism from The New York Times, The AP, New York Magazine and many other publications. He received his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from NYU.                           The Early History of God      (FRSEM-UA 472; class # 12927)   Instructor: Mark Smith   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     Like other areas of human life and experience, gods and goddesses are complex phenomena, requiring study and thinking. This course focuses on how gods and goddesses (deities) \u2013 and divinity more broadly \u2013 were understood in ancient literatures. We will consider Gilgamesh and the Epic of Creation from Mesopotamia, Canaanite myths and legends, and Israel\u2019s Bible/Old Testament, among other texts. This course centers on the \u201cjob description\u201d of gods and goddesses (what deities are and what they have to be able to do to qualify as deities); the emotions of deities (anger, love, fear, etc.); their gender and sexuality; the animals thought to represent them (\u201cemblem animals\u201d); the various relationships of deities to one another and to humans; the divine creation of the world and of humanity; and deities in love and war. The course also addresses \"monotheism\" in ancient Israel, namely, the belief in only one god.   MARK S. SMITH holds the Skirball Chair of Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at New York University. He completed his Ph.D. at Yale in 1985. He has served twice as Lady Davis Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.. He was honored as President of the Catholic Biblical Association of America in 2010-2011, and in 2011 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research. He is also a two-time winner of New York University\u2019s Golden Dozen Award and the recipient of the Frank Moore Cross award for publication awarded by the American Schools of Oriental Research. He has published over eighty articles, including first editions of four minor manuscripts from Cave Four of the Dead Sea Scrolls. He has authored thirteen books and co-authored three others.      Political Theater      (FRSEM-UA 476; class # 12940)   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? This course offers an interdisciplinary perspective on these questions. In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, students will learn about the development of different dramatic techniques and forms through the history of theater, about the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy, and about the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques.     ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.      Physics at Accelerators      (FRSEM-UA 477; class # 12933)   Instructor: Henry Stroke   Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     We will look at the nucleus of the atom with quite unusual magnifiers. These will involve interactions of atomic electrons with nuclei studied by laser spectroscopy, radiofrequencies, or nuclear decays. The microscopy is refined to get smaller and smaller details with the use of particle beam accelerators. These rely on scattering experiments allowing the highest resolution to be achieved. Much of the discussion will be based on work done at the European Center for Particle Research (CERN), a forefront facility for these investigations. The discussion will require an introduction to the theory of relativity, mechanics of collisions, particle physics, and antimatter. Basic electricity and magnetism, necessary for discussing both the fundamental interactions and the instrumentation, will be introduced. Decays of radioactive nuclei will lead into detection techniques for alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. Dosimetry and radiation protection will be discussed, as will nuclear weapons and disasters, and nuclear power generation. Instrumentation, e.g. Geiger counters, scintillation crystals, photomultipliers, wire chambers, coincidence circuits, multichannel devices, will be among the numerous detection techniques encountered.     HENRY STROKE, Professor of Physics, has spent a major part of his research effort at NYU, MIT, Princeton, and CERN studying electric and magnetic properties of nuclei through their interaction with atomic electrons. The experimental techniques ranged from optics and radiofrequency to more recent laser spectroscopy. A major facility in this work has been CERN-ISOLDE, an \"on-line\" mass separator which allows studies of species that have half-lives as low as a few milliseconds. ISOLDE relies on its isotope production on the beginning chain of accelerators that ends with the 27-km long LHC (Large Hadron Collider) ring. His work also brought him to look, with low-temperature techniques, for a possible  non-zero neutrino mass.    Heloise: A Woman for the Twelfth Century      (FRSEM-UA 478; class # 12934)   Instructor: Fiona Griffiths   Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      Few medieval women have been so often studied and yet so little understood as Heloise, abbess of the Paraclete (d. 1164). Her life, known primarily through the letters that she exchanged with her former husband, the philosopher Peter Abelard (d. 1142), offers a study in contradiction: she was an educated woman at a time when women were supposedly barred from education; a nun who, though dedicated to God, battled sexual desire; a mother, whose spiritual daughters seemingly displaced her one biological son; and a wife, whose husband became her \u201cbrother\u201d in Christ. Traditional accounts have flattened these rich and various contradictions, presenting Heloise primarily as a tragic heroine. Seduced by her much older teacher, this Heloise conceives and bears a child, seeks a love unfettered by bonds of wedlock, and ultimately accepts enclosure in the monastery as her last desperate act of obedience to her lover, Abelard. This seminar revises the traditional image of Heloise, dignifying her as a scholar, monastic reformer, and administrator\u2014as well as a lover, wife, mother, and friend.      FIONA J. GRIFFITHS, Associate Professor in the Department of History, is a medievalist who focuses on women and gender within the monastic life from late antiquity through the thirteenth century. A Canadian by birth, she earned her PhD from Cambridge University and has received fellowships from the Institute of Historical Research (London), the National Endowment for the Humanities, Harvard University, and the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung.      Comparative Revisionism in Historical Writing      (FRSEM-UA 482; class # 12935)   Instructor: Joe Lee   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      'Revisionist' and 'Revisionism' are two of the most widely used terms in recent historical discourse to describe particular types of historical writing. They are used as terms of praise, criticism, and abuse. This course seeks to explore the modalities of thought of both revisionists and their critics by looking at a number of case-studies in comparative historical perspective, striving to locate them in their particular historical circumstances and conjunctures. Case studies concerning specific controversies relating to British, German, Irish and Israeli historical writing, frequently involving foreign, including American, authorities in these fields, will be analyzed to determine what general conclusions, if any, can be deduced concerning modalities of historical thought.     JOE LEE has been Professor of History and Irish Studies at NYU since 2002, and is Glucksman Chair of Irish Studies and Director of Glucksman Ireland House NYU. He was previously at University College Cork (Ireland), where he chaired the History Department and served for periods as Dean of Arts and as Vice President. He is a former Member of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament and former Member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body; he also served as the Chair of the Fulbright Commission for Ireland and as President of the Irish Association for European Studies. He is author of seminal histories of Ireland, The Modernization of Irish Society, 1848-1918 and the prize-winning Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society . His op-ed columns for the Sunday Tribune were collected as The Shifting Balance of Power: Exploring the 20th Century , and he recently co-edited Making the Irish American: The History and Heritage of the Irish in the United States with Marion R. Casey.      American Gothics: Hauntings in Fiction, Film and Culture from 1820-2012      (FRSEM-UA 485; class # 12936)   Instructor: Beth Machlan   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Thursday, 9:30 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.     This course will explore the roots of the complex aesthetic category known as \u201cThe Gothic,\u201d particularly the ways in which Gothic narratives, from \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow\u201d to \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d have provided uncannily apt representations of American experience from the colonial era to the present. We will think about why the Gothic genre, which traveled with colonists and immigrants from Western Europe, has persisted in American art as a way of depicting and working through peculiarly American tensions about race, class, mobility, and desire, raising the question of how a \u201cnew\u201d nation could become so haunted, so quickly. Armed with excerpts from three hundred years of criticism and theory, we will try to locate the source of the specters in novels by Mark Twain, Ann Petry, and Steven King, films like \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cPanic Room,\u201d and other social and political spectacles such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the aftermath of 9/11.     BETH BOYLE MACHLAN is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. She has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching from both NYU and Princeton University, where she received her Ph.D. in 2004 with a dissertation on ghost stories.

Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts      (FRSEM-UA 490; class # 12937)   Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons   Class meetings: Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We will examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students will visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art.     AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Daily News, Kenyon Review, Anderbo , and elsewhere, and won awards from Yale University and Open City magazine.

The Cultural Work of Play      (FRSEM-UA 491; class # 12938)   Instructor: Louis Bury   Class Meetings: Tuesdays, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note:conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      In his book Homo Ludens , Latin for \"man the player,\" Dutch historian Johan Huizinga defined play as a free and disinterested activity separate from \"real\" or \"ordinary\" life. Yet, free and disinterested as play may appear, the forms it takes and the significance participants and spectators accord to it always carries with them values. In this seminar, we will read across a wide variety of genres and disciplines in order to consider the myriad ways in which people have understood the importance of play and games to culture. As well, we will explore the extent to which work--both academic and otherwise--permits, even encourages, forms of serious play. Possible readings include: articles of the sociology of sport; articles on game theory; treatises on stadium financing and design; novels; memoirs; films; poems; works of ludic, or game-like, literature; works of literary journalism; works of art; works of history; works of anthropology; works of theory/philosophy. In addition to a final research project on the subject of play, students will be expected to compose weekly writing assignments, many of them playful in nature.     LOUIS BURY's first book, Exercises in Criticism: The Theory and Practice of Literary Constraint (forthcoming from Dalkey Archive Press), plays with the conventions of academic writing through the use of arbitrary rules and procedures (such as a chapter written on the subway and a chapter written entirely in questions). He is currently at work on a book of creative non-fiction and cultural criticism entitled The Gym . He is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU and he holds a Ph.D. in English from the CUNY Graduate Center. During graduate school, he supported himself as a part-time professional poker player.      Women in Social Movements in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 493; class # 12939)   Instructor: Pamela Calla   Thursdays, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      The overarching theme of this seminar is the exploration of women's political agency in terms of emancipatory thought and action in diverse social movements throughout Latin America. We will locate this agency and characterize the thought and actions of women within social movements in various national contexts but we will also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we will focus on indigenous and other popular sectors as well as middle class movements concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle in these movements. A central consideration in this exploration is the historical relation between movements and states and the gendered logics that enter in the negotiations between the two. This will allow us to weave women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action in relation to their own notions of political and democratic gains and inclusion and attainment (or not) of economic, cultural, racial and gender justice vis-a-vis the state in each country examined.

Description       Why do some stories scare us? This course seeks to define and examine fear by reading scary stories defined as gothic. The course begins with the birth of the &quot;Gothic&quot; novel in Great Britain and traces the genre's evolution during the revolutionary turmoil of the 1790s. In addition to reading the gothic as a response to a shifting political landscape, we consider the extent to which the gothic's ability to inspire fear and produce a sensory response relates to the goals of the Enlightenment. How does gothic literature test the limits of empiricism and question the authority of sensory experience? How and why do works of gothic literature succeed in creating fear? We read canonical works of the gothic, including drama, short stories, horror ballads,  and a satirical send-up of the genre . Readings may include M.G. Lewis' The Monk and Castle Spectre, Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, Miles Peter Andrews' The Enchanted Castle, Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher, Washington Irving's Legend of Sleepy Hollow and selected ballads such as &quot;The Children in the Wood,&quot; &quot;Tam Lin,&quot; and &quot;Sweet William's Ghost.&quot;                   Course Type       First-Year Program: Research Seminars (FIRST-UG)                               top of page                                                                   NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

The aim was to offer select freshmen, in their very first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike. The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992 to more than sixty in recent fall semesters. The instructors have been drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.With the launching of the College Cohort Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on individual or group projects.          Computer Simulation   (FRSEM-UA 207; class #7071)   Instructor: Charles S. Peskin   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics      Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course, students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.     CHARLES S. PESKIN is Silver Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science. His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor\u2019s Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.        Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature       (FRSEM-UA 210; class #7072)   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory.     FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.      The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America      (FRSEM-UA 218; class #7073)   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Tuesday, 6:45\u20138:45 p.m. (and several Thursdays in this time slot; see below)   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.       IMPORTANT: Please note amended meeting schedule for this course in the fall 2012 term. Students who are unable to accommodate both the Tuesday and Thursday classes should not register for the course.     Tuesday, September 4   Thursday, September 6   Tuesday, September 11   Thursday, September 20   Tuesday, October 2   Thursday, October 11   Tuesday, October 23   Tuesday, October 30   Tuesday, November 6   Tuesday, November 13   Tuesday, November 20    Last class: Tuesday, November 27     Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level.     JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.      First Amendment Freedom of Expression      (FRSEM-UA 235; class #7074)   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon   Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)    Conflicts over freedom of speech and press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources who provide critical information for a story of national importance. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the sharp disagreements over what freedom of speech and press meant in 1789, even as Madison drafted the amendment. Students will learn about the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. The course will look at freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is an Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. He teaches courses on First Amendment law in which he focuses on freedom of speech and freedom of the press. His most recent book, Ellery\u2019s Protest, tells the story of one of the most controversial Supreme Court cases of the last century, Abington School District v. Schempp, in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in the public schools violated the First Amendment. Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a J.D. at Georgetown University Law Center.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies      (FRSEM-UA 255; class #7075)   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.     ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and has taught in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for Social Work in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.      Disease and History: Epidemics and Pandemics from Antiquity to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 265; class #13807)   Instructor: Richard Hull   Thursday, 11:00 a.m. \u2013 1:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     This seminar focuses on the historical dimensions of several major epidemics that profoundly affected human societies in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students identify each epidemic and explore its causes, origins, means of transmission, efforts at containment, and impacts on societies, particularly on their cultural development. They examine representations of the epidemic in the arts, media, and literature of the period, as well as assess the effects of each disease on demographics, religions, economies, and lifestyles. To what extent did an epidemic, or plague, accelerate or retard fundamental changes in human relationships within societies and between them, and the ways people viewed themselves and their universe? Students read and discuss several core texts and write a short response paper on each. They also write a brief paper on a disease of their choice and discuss their findings in class.     RICHARD HULL is Professor of History. A specialist in African and European history, he is the author of numerous books, including African Cities and Towns, Modern Africa , and Munyakare: African Civilizations , as well as coauthor of the two-volume World Civilizations . He has received both the Great Teacher Award and three Golden Dozen Awards for Teaching Excellence.      Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Duelling with Health Science Information      (FRSEM-UA 278; class #13804)   Instructor: Ralph Katz   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The common citizen is well challenged\u2014if not overly challenged\u2014trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \u201cScientific\u201d health findings of this week seem routinely to conflict with the \u201cscientific\u201d health findings of last week. As the movie theme song first asked so poignantly over three decades ago, \u201cWhat\u2019s it all about, Alfie?\u201d This course explores that question as it relates to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions about health behaviors, and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a framework for understanding this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \u201cinstant, electronic news\u201d world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, truth, polar bears, limes, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \u201cop-ed\u201d article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.     RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He has been the Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton\u2019s 1997 apology to the African-American community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master\u2019s degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.      From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia      (FRSEM-UA 282; class #7076)   Instructor: Edward W. Lehman   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The second decade of the new millennium has dawned with intensifying ideological cleavages in the United States and assertions that we are increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and democratic institutions. Our seminar\u2019s aim is to assess these diagnoses using Amitai Etzioni\u2019s The New Golden Rule as a theoretical template and relying on such analytical dimensions as autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. We first situate American society in the broader context of decisive moral and social transformations which have occurred in Western civilization over the last two thousand years. To that end, our seminar looks at Rodney Stark\u2019s acclaimed The Rise of Christianity , which focuses on formative developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era, and Max Weber\u2019s classic, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism . We then examine social-science analyses of the contemporary American situation, with the help of such books as Habits of the Heart by Robert Bellah and his colleagues. Our final readings are Robert Putnam\u2019s controversial Bowling Alone, which remains the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life, and Claude S. Fischer\u2019s recent Made in America , which paints a much more upbeat picture of what is happening around us.     EDWARD W. LEHMAN is Professor Emeritus of Sociology. His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics , and The Viable Polity. He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations . He has edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology , a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities.      Communications and Human Values      (FRSEM-UA 291; class #7077)   Instructor: Richard D. Heffner   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      This seminar is an intellectual inquiry into the development of American public policy as it relates to mass communications. It is not a practicum, not a \u201chow-to\u201d course about film and television, nor about the media generally. The seminar\u2019s purpose is instead to analyze how much of our sense of what it means to be an American early in the 21st century has been molded by the media\u2014first print and now increasingly electronic\u2014with particular reference to their socializing and value-legitimating content. To learn about and then deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the role of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through class discussion of such readings as Walter Lippmann\u2019s Public Opinion , Robert Merton\u2019s Mass Persuasion , J. S. Mill\u2019s On Liberty , Herman Melville\u2019s Billy Budd , and Neil Postman\u2019s Amusing Ourselves to Death ; of such films as Hearts and Minds, JFK , and Fahrenheit 9/11 ; and of the increasingly unfair and unbalanced rants and raves of America\u2019s newer communications outlets. Finally, class emphasis is placed on analyzing and resolving such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \u201cchilling effect\u201d of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \u201cmobocracy,\u201d with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); the importance of journalistic \u201cprivilege\u201d; and media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).     RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind , which he began over half a century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York\u2019s pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952; Eighth Revised and Updated Edition\u2014with Alexander Heffner\u20142009) and the editor of Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America (1956; reissued 2010). His newest books are a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001) and his paperback edition of As They Saw It\u2026 A Half Century of Conversations from the Open Mind (2003). From 1974 to 1994 Mr. Heffner served as Chairman of the film industry\u2019s voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.      The Crusades and Their Legacy      (FRSEM-UA 296; class #7078)   Instructor: Jill N. Claster   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     The Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters in the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. The unexpected result of the First Crusade was the conquest of lands in the Middle East known as the Latin Kingdom, or Outremer, the lands across the sea. For two hundred years, against all odds, the Crusaders managed to keep some of their newly won lands. They lost more of them with every passing decade, however, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the Middle East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, the background which made it possible for thousands of people for over two centuries to join the crusading movement, and the religious ardor which informed the Crusades. It also focuses on life in the Latin Kingdom in the Holy Land, particularly on the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. Most of all, the course addresses many issues that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the centuries-long legacy of the crusading era.     JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 (2009). She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She was the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.      Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?      (FRSEM-UA 306; class #7079)   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30 p.m.-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America\u2019s problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.     JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA returned to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

He is the author of nineteen books, including, in English, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War; Compa\u00f1ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara; Perpetuating Power; Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants; and Leftovers: Tales of the Latin American Left (with Marco Morales) He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.      Documentary Theater      (FRSEM-UA 351; class #7081)   Instructor: Carol Martin   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     This course explores the subject matter, history and theoretical discourses surrounding the global occurrence of contemporary theatre of the real, also popularly known as documentary theatre. By analyzing the content, structure and dramatic devices of a number of plays, we will look at the problems and possibilities of the ways in which theatre that cites reality portrays a range of human behavior from everyday life to important political events in the attempt to create and recreate personal, political, and historical realities. Documentary theatre both acknowledges a positivist faith in empirical reality and underscores an epistemological crisis in knowing truth. We will read plays about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, terrorism, the Holocaust, racial clashes, the deposition of Cardinal Law, Oscar Wilde, the murder of Matthew Shepard, Lebanese suicide bombers, the open murder of demonstrators in Greensboro, the cover up of industrial accidents in Poland, honor killings in Holland, and accompanying theoretical essays, as well as look at some performances on video. The questions we will consider include: Can theatre effectively critique social and moral values? What are the implications of the blurring of art and life? Are fiction and nonfiction adequate terms for considering the idea of truth? How might we consider theatre of the real from the vantage point of the contemporary collapse of the distinction between the real, the simulated and the virtual?     CAROL MARTIN is Professor of Drama at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. She writes on documentary theatre, contemporary American and Japanese performance, as well as on performance and globalization. Her essays and interviews have appeared in academic journals in the U.S. and abroad and in the New York Times and have been translated into French, Polish, Chinese, and Japanese. Her most recent book is Dramaturgy of the Real on the World Stage .      Literary Theory and Its Applications      (FRSEM-UA 355; class #7082)   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Students in this seminar will read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the 20th century to the present. They will learn to consider different approaches to literature. They will complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.     JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature.

From Mind to Brain and Back Again      (FRSEM-UA 357; class #16356)   Instructor: Joseph LeDoux   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     What is mind? Is it a system of impulses or something changeable? This paraphrase of a Bart Simpson remark captures one of the great debates in history: to what extent are we hard-wired as opposed to shaped by experience? Several hundred years ago, fundamental questions such as these were addressed by philosophers. The birth of psychology in the late 19th century gave us ways of studying the mind scientifically rather than simply speculating about it. Modern neuroscience gives us a new approach, one in which we use discoveries about the brain to understand who we are and why we are that way. What have we learned? And does this approach enhance (or diminish) our sense of who we are? In this course we address these questions, looking at the issues both historically and in terms of modern discoveries. We use the topic of emotions, and their relation to the brain, as a window on the broader problem of mind and brain.      JOSEPH LEDOUX is a University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, and a member of the Center for Neural Science and of the Department of Psychology at NYU. He received his Ph.D. in psychology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1977.

The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1590-1680: The Age of Caravaggio and Bernini      (FRSEM-UA 366; class #13805)   Instructor: Guy Walton   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Recent biographies of Caravaggio and Bernini provide the basis for this course, which takes papal patronage of the arts in seventeenth-century Rome as its subject. We will explore the reigns of Sixtus V, Paul V, Urban VIII, Innocent X, and Alexander VII\u2014all \u201cbuilder\u201d popes from a time when Rome was considered the artistic capital of Europe\u2014and the masterpieces of painting, sculpture, architecture and city planning they sponsored. In addition to Caravaggio and Bernini, whose clay models will be exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the fall, we will study (among others) Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. During the first weeks of the semester, students will present short biographies of a number of the outstanding personalities of the Counter Reformation and Baroque, from saints to nobles to prelates. Particular stress will be placed on those messages, religious and secular, that were specifically expressed in the rebuilding of the ancient and early Christian city of Rome and its monuments, including such magisterial works as St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, along with many city squares, churches, monasteries, villas and palaces. These remarkable monuments of art and architecture will provide the subjects for the substantial term papers required for the course at the end of the term.     GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (M.A., Ph.D.). His research and publications have centered on the courts of Europe of the Early Modern period, including those of the popes in Rome, and on the artists and architects who worked for those rulers. His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles (London and Chicago 1986).      The Writer in New York      (FRSEM-UA 367; class #8879)   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     New York was once the undisputed capital of American literary life. Taking on the many images and expressions of the writer in New York over the past century and more, this seminar presents the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We read primary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. An important goal of the course is to reach a nuanced historical understanding of our city, acknowledging its peculiar power to erase its own history as it changes and grows. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we will try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.     VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content (2002). His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ, Esquire, Harper\u2019s Magazine, the Nation, the New York Times Magazine, and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.      Welcome to College: The Novel      (FRSEM-UA 371; class #7083)   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we will read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contemporary Ivy League university). We will discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students will write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we will explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.

She received a Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005.      Lethal Passions: Medea and Her Legacies      (FRSEM-UA 377; class #8167)   Instructor: Liana Theodoratou   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The mythic figure of Medea has held our imagination for nearly 2,500 years. What kind of woman is capable of casting such an enduring spell? Best known as the partner of Jason and the murderer of her own children, Medea has been the name of an exploration into the passion and violence, the devastation and vengeance, the complex relations and modes of betrayal that so often punctuate our everyday existence. She has demanded that we think about the relations between the sexes, the meaning of home and exile, the experience of the foreigner, the ethical and moral dimensions of agency and decisions, and the meaning of motherhood. Because these issues have remained vital, her popularity has outlived the ancient Greek texts in which she was born and has found new expressions in various forms\u2014including tragic drama, poetry, novels, painting, cinema, and music. This course seeks to understand the reasons for her longevity in the rich complexity of her character and actions and to explore the ways in which her story has been revised and recontextualized across the ages for new and different ends. We will consider a range of texts from antiquity to the present in order to think about how they understand the tensions, contradictions, and conflicting desires embodied and enacted in this mesmerizing figure.     LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College\u2019s Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.

She is currently completing a book on the politics of mourning in contemporary Greek poetry, entitled Mourning Becomes Greece .      The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right      (FRSEM-UA 379; class #7084)   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Tuesday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients\u2019 options and care. Determining how to treat patients correctly and safely is difficult, but figuring out what is right is even harder. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Students submit weekly essays on subjects assigned in class and write a long essay at the end of the semester.     MICHAEL E. MAKOVER, M.D., is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine, Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center, and in active practice of internal medicine and rheumatology.

New York City: A Survey, 1609\u20131898      (FRSEM-UA 383; class #7086)   Instructor: Leo Hershkowitz   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12 p.m.     In this study of New York City, we shall look for answers to several basic questions. For example, how did the city become the \u201cWorld\u2019s Capital\u201d? Why is New York so different from other American cities? Why is it the center of art, music, finance, science? Is New York an American city? How have artists, writers, and travelers viewed New York? How do New Yorkers see New York? What is its future? This is also a voyage into unknown New York by means of archival sources largely overlooked by historians, but which are important to understanding the complexity, as well as the excitement, that is New York history. Many of these primary sources are now in the Tamiment Library at NYU, while others are at the New York Historical Society and such city agencies as the offices of the County Clerk, the Municipal Archives, and Register of New York County. The materials found there are basic to the lectures, discussions, and students\u2019 papers in the class. There will also be a walking tour of lower Manhattan and visits to a number of institutions where archival materials are housed.     LEO HERSHKOWITZ, Professor of History at Queens College, CUNY, has written widely on aspects of New York City history. His work has also included testimony before the U.S. Supreme Court (1997) and consultancy to the New York Attorney General, the County Clerk of New York County, and the Appellate Division of the State of New York, First Department.

He received a Ph.D. in history from New York University and a Doctorate of Humane Letters from the Hebrew Union College, Jewish Institute of Religion.      Computational Thought      (FRSEM-UA 385; class #7087)   Instructor: Dennis Shasha   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience     Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style will combine straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python). Students will make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, evolutionarily inspired robots, DNA computing, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges.     DENNIS E. SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science. His fields of research include computational biology, technologically enhanced privacy, and pattern matching. On the way to becoming a computer scientist, he studied linguistics, engineering, and philosophy. You can find some of his puzzles on the Scientific American website : www.sciam.com .      Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine &amp; Other Sources      (FRSEM-UA 393; class #7089)   Instructor: Michele Shedlin   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     The purpose of this seminar is to explore the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. To explore these issues, we will focus on readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts. This will guide our discussions on the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. Students will become familiar with conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is continually balanced between suffering and comfort.      MICHELLE SHEDLIN, Ph.D., Professor, NYU College of Nursing, is a medical anthropologist with extensive experience in reproductive health, substance abuse and HIV/AIDS research in Africa, Latin America and the U.S. She has designed and implemented behavioral studies at the community, university and national levels, to inform and evaluate prevention and care.

Her publications and reports address HIV risk behavior and care, ethical issues in research and practice, immigrant health, and women\u2019s reproductive decision-making and access to services.      America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II      (FRSEM-UA 405; class #7094)   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving into the conversation current foreign policy issues that are challenging America. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950. Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the activities of the CIA in recent years; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America\u2019s long involvement in the Middle East, including its more than 60-year support for the State of Israel and the alleged influence of the \u201cIsrael Lobby\u201d on U.S. foreign policy; the current U.S. relationship with Iran; how the U.S. may have inflamed the  insurgency in Iraq during the first few years of the war; the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.

Branding: People, Places, Things      (FRSEM-UA 422; class #7096)   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     As thinking people, we want to believe that we are resistant to branding and its most obvious tool, advertising. Yet both penetrate: occasionally honestly, sometimes deviously, often entertainingly. How do they do it, even when our guards are up? Why do we revere Apple, feel wary of American Apparel, admire Google, and resent BP? Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us, and companies often don\u2019t really know what works, or how; sometimes, they are just lucky. Brands also have a darker side, according to some social commentators, and may lead to mass consumer hypnosis. This course analyzes what makes brands tick, how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and politicians, taking a short look back at the creation of \u201cObama Nation\u201d and a long look back to 1968, when many of today\u2019s tools were developed. We then cross the moat to our own lives, asking ourselves: how are we perceived? How do we create, change, and live up to our own reputations; that is, our own \u201cbrands\u201d?

Guitar Heroes (and Heroines): Music, Video Games, and the Nature of Human Cognition      (FRSEM-UA 427; class # 7097)   Instructor: Gary Marcus   Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     A look at music and video games from the perspective of cognitive and evolutionary psychology. Among the questions we consider: Why are human beings so passionate about music and so easily sucked in by video games? Is our love of music the product of natural selection? Can science tell us anything about what works in music and what doesn\u2019t? What is the relationship between music and language? Is there a \u201cuniversal grammar\u201d for music? Will machines ever be able to create satisfying works of music? The primary focus is on the psychology of music, with video games serving as counterpoint. Readings are drawn from a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Written assignments include weekly reaction papers and a final paper proposing a novel experiment.

Trials of the Century      (FRSEM-UA 434; class #7100)   Instructor: Jack Ford   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials. These trials have provided a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are often revealed. This course will offer in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century.\u201d Some, such as the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson trial, will focus on the impact of celebrity on the justice system. Others, such as the trials of the \u201cScottsboro Boys,\u201d will examine the effect of race inside the courtroom. Political issues often find voice in the justice system, as in the case of the \u201cChicago Seven.\u201d And religion, that great uniting and dividing force, played a critical role in the Scopes \u201cMonkey Trial.\u201d Such trials have historically held a mirror up to society and have provided an instructive reflection of what transpires within our courts of law.

History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.      (FRSEM-UA 437; class #7102)   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.     This course explores the relationship between history and memory, between what we know and how we know what we think we know. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese-Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education , McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. To understand better the lives of those people most affected by acts of injustice, we will read works by such writers as Baldwin, Roth, and Salinger. We will also consider the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.

The \u201cLong 19th Century\u201d: Sixty Glorious Years, 1876\u20131936      (FRSEM-UA 439; class #13806)   Instructor: Rena Mueller   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The historical narrative of the \u201clong century,\u201d as defined by British historian Eric Hobsbawm, referring to the period between the years 1789 and 1914, has been extended conceptually in the last two decades by the work of Giovanni Arrighi. But this idea of the \u201clong century\u201d when applied to the period 1876-1936 holds for music as well: for comprehensive brilliance and diversity, the period from 1876 to 1936 is unsurpassed in the history of Western music. The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw the composition\u2014and frequently unruly first performances\u2014of Schoenberg\u2019s Second String Quartet, Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht , and Pierrot Lunaire ; of Stravinsky\u2019s Firebird, Petrouchka , and Le Sacre du Printemps ; and the early works of Berg, Webern, and Bart\u00f3k. Richard Strauss\u2019s operas Salome and Elektra jockeyed for place with L\u00e9har\u2019s The Merry Widow and Oscar Straus\u2019s The Chocolate Soldier , among others.   This class will explore the \u201cisms\u201d most often associated with artistic and literary movements but quickly appropriated by music of the time: Romanticism, Post-Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Futurism, Positivism, and Dadaism. Four broad themes\u2014musical musical evolution and revolution, social structure, literary and musical nationalism, and anxiety\u2014will form the core of the class. In particular, we will investigate the two cities where modernism was born but where it was only uncomfortably at home, the polarities of 19th-century literary, artistic, and musical environments in Vienna (the negative \u201cfin-de-si\u00e8cle\u201d) and Paris (the positive \u201cla belle \u00c9poque\u201d), paying special attention to the works of Schnitzler, Freud, Jarry, Apollinaire, the Sezession, Der Blaue Reiter, Die Br\u00fccke, the Bauhaus, the Fauves, L\u2019art nouveau, and Cubism.

Virtue/Success/Happiness: Business in U.S. Literature      (FRSEM-UA 440; class # 7103)   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Monday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through the study of stories, novels, nonfiction, and film from 1776 to the present, we study the evolution of attitudes among some of the most engaging American writers to the central ideas of business. What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic developed? We examine what writers such as Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, and James thought about the American business of \u201cgetting and spending,\u201d and how Stowe and Twain reacted to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons\u201d of the Gilded Age, the rise of the corporation at the end of the century, and the enormous influx of immigration into American cities that fed the growth of capitalism shortly afterwards. In the 20th century, what do films like Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead tell us about how the connections between virtue, success, and happiness have developed? The course finishes with reflections on what conclusions we can draw from the recent financial crisis for our theme.

Three Moments in Witchcraft      (FRSEM-UA 441; class #7104)   Instructor: Laura Levine   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     In I Samuel 28, when King Saul wants to know what to do about the army of Philistines gathering at his door, he seeks out the witch of Endor to conjure up the dead Samuel to answer his questions. Renaissance commentators puzzled over what it is that the witch summoned up: a devil? The real Samuel? \u201cAn illusion\u201d says Reginald Scot in his Discoverie, the first book in the period to offer a theory of witch-hunts as scapegoating. For him, the witch of Endor was a ventriloquist. King James I of England also saw the scene as one of theater, but for him it was the devil playing Samuel. What lies at the root of the association between witchcraft and theater during the period? When Spenser has his heroes in Book I of The Faerie Queene strip the witch Duessa to look at her naked body, how is he commenting on the theatricality of judicial procedures? Why does The Winter\u2019s Tale \u2019s Leontes throw Paulina out of his chambers as a \u201cmankind witch\u201d? This course seeks to answer such questions, beginning with the Bible, focusing on the Renaissance and ending with the story of a mouse who was a witch and Balanchine\u2019s re-creation of the moment as a ballet.     LAURA LEVINE is an Associate Professor of Theater Studies in Drama at Tisch, where she teaches courses in Shakespeare, Renaissance studies, and autobiography and solo performance.

Truth and Sedition from Galileo to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 442; class #16512)   Instructor: William Klein   Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of truth change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes themselves implicates modes of knowing (as it did in the case of Galileo)? Are there truths that any regime would\u2014or should\u2014find dangerous? What are the possible motives for self-censorship? Beginning with the persecution of Galileo for his attack on Aristotelian doctrine, and ending with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes (from textbooks to cartoons to search engines), we will consider these questions in relation to select philosophic and literary analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, and \u017di\u017eek.     WILLIAM KLEIN studied the history of political theory under J.G.A. Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and has served on the editorial review board of The Journal of the History of Philosophy . At NYU, he teaches the history of political discourse in Liberal Studies, and conducts seminars on a variety of topics for the honors program in CAS. He is currently writing a study on the history and theory of sedition. In previous lives he worked as a ghost writer, an editor and a carpenter (hence the title of a recent piece on one of Italy's great artists, Franca Ghitti: \"Naive Notes on Franca's Nails by a Former Carpenter\"). In 2011-12 he taught for NYU in Florence.       Financial Systems as Social Forms: Comparing Conventional and Islamic Finance      (FRSEM-UA 444; class #8203)   Instructor: Mary Poovey   Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Financial systems direct the flow of capital between savers and borrowers, but they also reflect and help shape contemporary values and understandings of the self and others. In this course we compare and contrast the theories implicit in the financial systems of the United States and most other Western countries and those implicit in  Islamic financial institutions, which now exist in many parts of the world. The most basic distinction between the two systems involves assumptions about the economy and the individuals who participate in it. In the US, the economy is assumed to govern itself by the law of supply and demand, and individuals are assumed to be rational agents who seek to maximize their own profit and minimize personal loss. Credit\u2014and therefore debt\u2014is central to the US economy because interest-based financing is the primary mechanism for transferring money from one party to another.      In Islamic finance, by contrast, commercial transactions are governed by Shari\u2019ah law because the economy, like every other facet of life, is subject to the commands of Allah and because human reason is considered fallible. While Shari\u2019ah law bans one fundamental part of the US system\u2014interest\u2014it does recognize the principle of profit and loss sharing, and special financial instruments have been developed to enable individuals and institutions to form partnerships, transfer capital, and generate profits.      By comparing these two systems and the practices they require, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in an increasingly interconnected global context.       MARY POOVEY is the Samuel Rudin University Professor in the Humanities and Professor of English at New York University. She received a Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence from the College, and she was also recognized for excellence in teaching by Swarthmore College.

This course grows out of her current project, which is a co-authored book exploring the ways financial instruments and institutions shape the ways their users understand themselves and interact with the world.      From St. Petersburg to Paris and New York: George Balanchine and the Politics of Modernism      (FRSEM-UA 445; class #8204)   Instructor: Jennifer Homans   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course is a biography of modernism, told through the life and work of the ballet master George Balanchine. We trace Balanchine\u2019s path and artistic development from his birth in Imperial St. Petersburg in 1904 through the political and artistic tumult of the Russian Revolution, to Paris in the 1920s, where he collaborated with Serge Diaghilev and artists, dancers, and composers working at the forefront of modernism. From 1933 until his death in 1983, Balanchine lived in New York, where he and other \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists transformed the cultural life of the city. What did Balanchine\u2019s dances have to do with the political culture of Petersburg, Paris and New York? Can we trace the relationship between his life and his art?     Readings will range from history to memoir and biography. Students will also attend live performances and study dances and other forms of art at Lincoln Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Guggenheim Museum of Art. Grades will be based on weekly writing assignments, class participation, and an in-class presentation analyzing a dance or other work of art in its historical context.     JENNIFER HOMANS is the author of Apollo\u2019s Angels: A History of Ballet (2010) and the dance critic for the New Republic . She has also published with the New York Times, the New York Review of Books , and the Guardian , among others.

Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature      (FRSEM-UA 449; class #13813)   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through thematic analyses of books and films by topic and genre, this seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War-era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. We will examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Phillip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we will look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.     EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian who also teaches at Yale College. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

He received his BA from Columbia College and his JD from NYU Law School and is also an attorney specializing in Corporate Restructuring.      \u201cLaboratories for Democracy\u201d: Making American Cities Better      (FRSEM-UA 456; class #8256)   Instructor: Eric Gioia   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     At a time when many Americans have become increasingly frustrated with what government has produced, there are places that are getting it done right. Cities, states and municipalities serve as what Justice Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. From fighting crime in the streets of New York City, to banning smoking in bars and restaurants, to making the power grid more efficient, to encouraging the arts and culture in urban environments, innovations in American cities have spread across the globe. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action. We study best practices from around the country (and the world), evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.

Literature, Economics, and History in 18th-Century Britain      (FRSEM-UA 460; class #8941)   Instructor: Kevin Brine   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Few authors have had more influence on modern thought than Adam Smith, Samuel Johnson, and Edward Gibbon. Smith defined the terms by which we understand modern economics; Johnson taught us how to read English literature; and Gibbon pointed the way to modern historiography with an account of the Roman Empire that has never been surpassed. All three were members of the same Literary Club, founded by Johnson and the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1764. In 1791, Club member James Boswell published the remarkable biography Life of Johnson , which vividly portrays the intellectual life of Georgian Britain through an astounding wealth of anecdotes, intellectual repartee, and the personal details of an unforgettable and larger-than- life Samuel Johnson. In this course we read selections from Life of Johnson , Smith\u2019s The Wealth of Nations (1776), and Gibbon\u2019s The Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire (1776), with an eye toward the contemporary relevance of these works. Students come to know Samuel Johnson as though he were a family friend, gain a deep understanding of Adam Smith\u2019s concept of how a modern economy works, and see the ancient grandeur of Rome through the eyes of one of the world\u2019s most influential historians. Working in small groups, students learn to present their ideas in a seminar setting and improve their writing skills with assignments geared toward expressing their ideas and insights.     KEVIN R.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber      (FRSEM-UA 461; class #8960)   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English.     JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s (2002).

Oral History of Irish America      (FRSEM-UA 462; class #8971)   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. -12:00 noon    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an interdisciplinary approach to documenting the lived experience of Irish Americans and their communities in a small class setting. The course reviews the methodology of oral history, its significance as a resource, its role in historical research, specific interviewing and research techniques, and the opportunity to create an original public history document that will be deposited in the Archives of Irish America at NYU for use by scholars in a variety of research projects. Students will be assigned an interview subject chosen from the Irish American community in New York City. To date we have interviewed parish priests from the Bronx, an Oscar and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and director, a National Book Award-winning novelist, as well as actors, musicians, teachers, and Wall Street executives. In addition to the interview, the course includes classroom lectures, readings, and extensive writing exercises. The final project (which will undergo careful editing and numerous rewrites) includes a biography and full finding aid to the interview for the archive, as well as web content that will be launched on the Glucksman Ireland House Oral History website. This course offers real world experience and communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout students\u2019 academic and professional careers.

Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\"      (FRSEM-UA 463; class #14260)   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      In contemporary war, \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions--the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed: politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.      SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival (The Smile of the Lamb), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director (Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival (You Can Thank Me Later). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA).      Literature of the Absurd      (FRSEM-UA 464; class #14251)   Instructor: Thomas Bishop   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The absurd sensibility has profoundly marked writers of many countries and languages since the start of the 20th century. The notion of the absurd is most closely associated with the Theater of the Absurd, launched in the 1950's in Paris by, notably, Beckett and Ionesco, and continued world-wide by such playwrights as Pinter, Albee, Havel, Stoppard, and Frisch. But the preoccupation with the absurd was not limited to the theater; in the immediate post-World War II period, the Existentialists already had posited the absurdity of human\u2019s condition on this earth and works by Sartre and Camus brilliantly explored this philosophic position. The metaphysical anguish at the base of absurdist attitudes stemmed from what Martin Esslin, the author of the landmark Theater of the Absurd, called the disappearance of \u201cthe certitudes and unshakable basic assumptions of former ages [which were] swept away\u2026found wanting\u2026and discredited.\u201d Kafka\u2019s work is exemplary and the seminal depiction of the absurd for his century; many other writers view the world as fundamentally absurd, including Pirandello, Stein, Gombrowicz, Grass, Heller, Cort\u00e1zar, Vonnegut, Pynchon, Kertesz. Many filmmakers shared these perspectives, including Antonioni, Resnais, Godard, and more recently, Woody Allen. In a century that witnessed two unbelievably destructive worldwide conflicts, an era that made possible the Holocaust and other genocides, that produced Hiroshima and with it human\u2019s ability for the first time of destroying itself and the entire world, it is no surprise that the absurd would be a dominant stance, even if the absurd if often treated with devastating humor.   TOM BISHOP is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature, and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization.

Dostoyevsky: Modernity and the Novel      (FRSEM-UA 466; class #14269)   Instructor: Ilya Kriger   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will examine Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction as a particularly helpful prism for understanding the conditions, experience and philosophical ramifications of modernity. The novel is often understood as the genre best capable of representing and reckoning with the complexities of modern life. This is, in fact, how Dostoevsky himself understood his mission as a novelist. Following his cue, then, we will try to understand what it is about his writing that is specifically modern. Readings of Dostoevsky\u2019s novels, early as well as late, will be supplemented by a number of canonical statements about the modern. Readings from Dostoevsky will include Poor People, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov . Supplementary readings from Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Benjamin, Mikhail Bakhtin and others.      ILYA KLIGER is assistant professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at NYU. His primary interests include the nineteenth-century novel in Russia and France as well as literary and critical theory. His first book explores the parallel developments of the notions of temporality in nineteenth-century novelistic and philosophical works. His more recent projects have involved exploring tragic patterns in the tradition of the Russian novel.      The Statue of Liberty: Icon of America      (FRSEM-UA 467; class #14253)   Instructor: Edward Berenson   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The Statue of Liberty is perhaps the most beloved of all American symbols. Yet no one living in 1885, when the crated monument arrived in New York Harbor, could have foreseen the central place the Statue of Liberty would come to occupy in the American imagination. Most Americans had never heard of the French intellectuals who proposed to build it, and many thought the whole idea presumptuous and bizarre. The statue\u2019s supporters feared it would never go up. The course will begin with Liberty\u2019s uncertain origins in French art and politics and then consider the trials of its reception and construction in New York Harbor. We will see how the statue\u2019s symbolically indistinct, neoclassical form has allowed Americans to interpret its meaning in diverse ways: as representing the emancipation of the slaves, Tocqueville's ideal of orderly liberty, opportunity for \"huddled masses,\" and, in the years since 9/11, the freedom and resilience of the United States and New York City in the face of terror. We will also examine the statue\u2019s prominent role in American popular culture. About midway through the semester, the class will take the ferry to Liberty Island and climb to the statue\u2019s crown.     EDWARD BERENSON is professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at NYU. In 1999, he won the American Historical Association\u2019s Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award. He is the author or editor of six books, the most recent of which are Heroes of Empire: Five Charismatic Men and the Conquest of Africa (2010) and The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story (2012).       Schools in the Greek and Roman World      (FRSEM-UA 468; class #14255)   Instructor: Raffaella Cribiore   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      This course will give students knowledge of ancient schooling in the Greek and Roman worlds and will cover liberal arts education (in its three levels, primary, grammatical, and rhetorical) and schools of medicine. Some scholars have recently maintained that the network of schools in the ancient world was so puny that the levels of illiteracy were extremely high. Yet it is important to take into account that it is difficult to identify schools because they were usually not housed in buildings designated for this purpose, often occupied private quarters, and education went on in the open air or within the family. At the end of the course students will realize that much caution is needed in evaluating education in the ancient world.     The course will be based on the literary sources, the school exercises from Greek and Roman Egypt, and on archaeological sources. Students will examine evidence regarding schools that have recently come to light in Rome and Greek Alexandria. They will pay special attention to the Greek school found in Egypt in the Dakhla Oasis through the excavation sponsored by New York University.     RAFFAELLA CRIBIORE is a professor in the Department of Classics and is considered an expert in ancient education. His first book was Writing, Teachers and Students in Greco-Roman Egypt (Scholars Press 1996), which contained a catalogue of 406 school exercises that emerged from the sands of Egypt. This book was followed by Gymnastics of the Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt (Princeton 2001). This book was awarded the Goodwin Prize in 2003, the most prestigious award in the field of Classics. In 2006, Professor Cribiore wrote, in collaboration with Roger Bagnall, Women\u2019s Letters from Ancient Egypt, 300BC-AD 800 (Michigan University Press). In 2007 he published again with Princeton University Press The School of Libanius in Late Antique Antioch , which studied a very prestigious school of rhetoric in Syria.      Pagans and Christians in Roman Egypt      (FRSEM-UA 469; class #14256)   Instructor: Nicola Aravecchia   Friday, 9:30-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This course explores the subject of paganism in late Roman Egypt and the role that Christianity played in shaping a new religious, social, and cultural environment between the third and sixth centuries CE. The goal is to gain an understanding of the process by which the new religion spread in a heavily Hellenized part of the Mediterranean world, influenced by Classical culture and religious beliefs but also attached to its traditional religious heritage. The seminar will touch upon issues of religious and cultural resistance, imperial involvement, official propaganda, proselytism, and syncretic manifestations of devotional practice. Attention will also be paid to the variety of forms in which Christianity (and modes of Christian life) developed in Egypt, expressive of a complex but deeply fascinating world of ideas and beliefs. The religious topography of pre-Christian Egypt, in which temples were prime visual landmarks, will be examined and compared with the dramatic changes brought by the appearance and dissemination of Christian places of cult and monastic life.     NICOLA ARAVECCHIA is Clinical Assistant Professor of Archaeology at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World and the academic director of New York University\u2019s semester abroad program in Egypt. His research interests concern Egypt in Late Antiquity and focus on the origins and development of Early Christian art and architecture in that region of the Mediterranean world. He also has a strong interest in the application of models of spatial analysis to archaeology, with the goal of studying how public and private spaces were constructed and used in antiquity and how they affected social relationships. He is the field director of the archaeological mission of Ain el-Gedida, a fourth-century settlement in the Dakhla Oasis of Upper Egypt, where he has been excavating since 2006. Currently, he is working on the final archaeological report of the 2006-2008 excavation seasons. He is also the deputy field director of the archaeological mission of Amheida in the Dakhla Oasis.      Picasso: Poetry and Invention      (FRSEM-UA 470; class #14257)   Instructor: Pepe Karmel   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Pablo Picasso is widely recognized as the greatest artist of the 20th century. But what is it that makes his work so powerful and influential? This seminar will explore Picasso\u2019s achievement in depth, looking at paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints from all eight decades of his career. On one hand, we will look at the astonishing series of new formal languages that he invented between 1907 through 1957. On the other, we will look at Picasso\u2019s remarkable work as a figurative storyteller and poet, exploring the fundamental human emotions of joy and sorrow, love and desire, alienation and aggression. Along with texts by biographers, critics, and art historians, we will read works by poets such as, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Cocteau, and Paul Eluard,who were his closest friends.      PEPE KARMEL teaches in the Department of Art History, New York University. His book, Picasso and the Invention of Cubism , was published by Yale University Press in 2003.

He is currently working on a history of abstract art.       A Nation of War      (FRSEM-UA 471; class #14398)   Instructor: Nikhil Singh   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore a controversial proposition: to what extent is the US a nation defined by commitments to and capacities for making war? Coming of age in the years since 9/11, many of you will not have known a time when the nation was not at war.      We will explore societal interests and attitudes that sustain an interest in war. For example, wars are commonly presented to the general public as necessary to preserve security, and ironically as a means toward peace. In the 1950s President Eisenhower warned of the rise of a \u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d that grew independent of any strategic or security interest. Some have argued that recent wars have been motivated by struggles over resources, particularly oil.      In the contemporary moment, publics are shielded from the consequences of war and thus may have different perspectives from combatants, soldiers and casualties of war. Wars can both unify a people and sharpen domestic political conflicts and societal divisions.      We will use selected course readings and documentary screenings to explore a range of social, philosophical and personal standpoints on America\u2019s wars past, present and future in an effort to answer an age-old question: \u201cwar, what is it good for?\u201d     NIKHIL PAL SINGH is Associate Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and History. He is a recent winner of NYU\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. teaching award.

He is the author of the prize-winning book, Black is a Country: Race and the Unfinished Struggle for Democracy , and is currently completing a work entitled Exceptional Empire: Race and War in US Globalism .      21st Century Literature: Methods, Materials, Maps      (FRSEM-UA 473; class #14399)   Instructor: Elaine Freedgood   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will read a selection of novels, poetry, and journalism written in the last twelve years that will help us explore the issues raised in the course\u2019s subtitle: \u201cmethods, materials and maps.\u201d The methods writers use in the twenty-first century to depict internal and external worlds, including realism, postmodernism, digital operations of chance and data mining, and poetry deviate significantly from our ideas of the lyric and the personal. Materials include illustrations\u2014the graphic novel and the comic, the artist\u2019s book, electronic media, and self-published zines. What is the geography of current world literature? What is global and/or local about it? The course will include \u201cfield trips\u201d to poetry and prose readings, book stores, and exhibits of printed and digital matter. Writers will include Indra Sinha, Chris Ware, Young Hae-Chang, Orhan Pamuk, Maureen McLane, Ian MacEwan, Karenn Tei Yamashita, Jesmyn Ward, Dexter Filkins, and Ed Roberson.      ELAINE FREEDGOOD is the author of Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World (Cambridge 2000) and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (Chicago 2006), and also the editor of Factory Production in Victorian Britain (Oxford 2003).

(FRSEM-UA 474; class #14400)   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open minded person? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career after graduation? To have a fun social life and make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and societal goals of higher education. It will also prompt you to be more reflective and purposeful about your own academic choices during your time as an NYU student. At the beginning of the 21st century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. During the semester we will study issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience. Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? Will new technologies change how professors teach and how students learn? Finally \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 how can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment?     TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Associate Professor and Associate Director of the Morse Academic Plan, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.      Why Lincoln Matters: Re-Envisioning the Politically Possible      (FRSEM-UA 475; class #14401)   Instructor: Philip Kunhardt   Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How was a man with less than a year of formal education able to become one of the nation\u2019s most salient political actors? Coinciding with the 2012 presidential election, and with the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, this seminar will involve students in an exploration of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s transformative leadership, a touchstone for all subsequent American presidencies. In an effort to understand why his memory still matters, and what contemporary political leaders can learn from his example, we will examine Lincoln\u2019s core writings and speeches for historical context, literary and political merit, and impact on the thinking of the American public. We will look at Lincoln\u2019s role in the Civil War, his use of political rhetoric, and his impact upon American civil liberties. How did the issues of slavery and race intersect with his development as a public figure? How was he influenced by other figures around him\u2014southerners, abolitionists, former slaves, and social conservatives? And how did he learn to use words so effectively to help produce social transformation? Lessons and warnings applicable to today will enter into our intensive group discussion. In papers and presentations students will examine aspects of presidential leadership of most interest to them and develop their writing and communication skills. In addition to Lincoln\u2019s published words, drawn from Roy Basler, Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings , texts will include David H. Donald, Lincoln ; Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial: Lincoln and Slavery ; ibid, Our Lincoln ; James Oakes, The Radical and the Republican ; Douglas Wilson, Honor\u2019s Voice ; and ibid, Lincoln\u2019s Sword . Students may also read a book on the American presidency as an institution, and on Barack Obama and/or his opposing candidate in the 2012 elections.

Swing Counties 2012: The Bush-Obama America      (FRSEM-UA 479; class #16513)   Instructor: David Dent   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     George Bush and Barack Obama are two very different leaders. Yet they have 272 counties in common. George Bush won those counties in 2000 and 2004 and Barack Obama won them in 2008. This course explores American politics and the electoral process through the prism of swing counties and voters. How do such voters and counties exist in this age of ideological polarization? Readings will include Dreams from My Father, Red State Blue State , among other articles and books that explore swing voters. Students will write two Op Ed pieces related to the concept of swing voters and complete a final project.      DAVID J.

Gender, Sexuality and the Law      (FRSEM-UA 480; class #16699)   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? We will explore gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce and, for example, family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law, as is well known, treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, prostitution, in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. For purposes of law, is discrimination against LGBT subjects best understood as analytically or socially distinct from sex-based discrimination? What's the relationship between sex stereotyping and homophobia? This course offers a history of U.S. sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments.     SHELLEY D. FISCHEL, ESQ., served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009.

Cannibalism      (FRSEM-UA 481; class # 16700)   Instructor: Dylon Robbins   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Western thought teaches us that people who eat people are \u201cbad.\u201d Indeed, the notion of cannibalism is a recurring concern in the history of ideas regarding the primitive, the animalistic, the monstrous, or any of the other classifications frequently invoked to mark others, regardless of their actual culinary preferences. An extended reflection on cannibalism as an intellectual phenomenon suggests how people eating people, or at least the possibility of it, says a great deal about those that do not. Interesting, as well, is the fact that, in some regions of the Caribbean and Brazil, ideas regarding cannibalism have made an important turn, such that the cannibal has become a provocative affirmation of self. The aim of this course is to think about cannibalism, not, as it often is, as a theme for anthropologists and ethnographers, but rather as an intellectual problem that has enjoyed a very long life in the history of ideas about self. In this course, we shall revisit a selection of texts regarding cannibalism from Columbus\u2019 diaries to the present, and including many noteworthy and fascinating interventions about the idea of cannibalism by, among others, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Cabeza de Vaca, Hans Staden, Goya, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar, Oswald de Andrade, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, and Juan Jos\u00e9 Saer.     DYLON ROBBINS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He teaches courses on Brazil and the Caribbean, with particular interest in the cultural and theoretical production of these regions, in addition to that of the African Diasporas in general, with particular concern for intellectual and cultural histories, media, cinema, and popular music. His work is supported by archival research in Brazil as a Fulbright-Hays fellow at the Cinemateca Brasileira and the Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros, and in Cuba at the ICAIC, the Biblioteca Nacional, and Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas. He is currently completing his book manuscript on popular music and political subjectivity in Brazil.      Audiovisual Stories: Creative Documentary Filmmaking in Latin America (2000\u20132012)      (FRSEM-UA 483; class #17048)   Instructor: Alexandra Falek   Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Creative documentaries present their subject in a poetic manner; they experiment with the formal and conceptual possibilities of storytelling by proposing an artistic engagement and (re)presentation of the questions, problems and ideas they explore. In Latin America, they are a vital part of long-standing film traditions. This seminar offers students the opportunity to acquire practical and perceptive skills related to the interpretation and analysis of recent creative documentaries made by renowned and new directors. We will examine the use and construction of storytelling elements (visual, aural, emotional, narrative, structural) in each film, always considering pertinent issues related to the film\u2019s particular production, exhibition and distribution contexts. As a way of building a strong foundation for the notions of \u201ccreativity\u201d and \u201cpoetry\u201d in filmmaking, we will make regular reference to seminal essays on classic documentary approaches and strategies. Students will develop critical proficiency by watching films on a regular basis, reading relevant texts by filmmakers, theorists and critics, and writing short exercises and a final project.     ALEXANDRA FALEK has been teaching at NYU since 2001 in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese Languages and Literatures, first as a doctoral student and since 2008, as an Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow. She was the co-director of Latin American Film Festival at NYU (2011) and the director of Uruguay Film Fest (2011). Her most recent teaching, research and publication explorations focus on documentary filmmaking in Latin America.      Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 484; class #17214)   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship \u2013 the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Other topics will include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of how New York City is an international city that has turned diversity into strength. The seminar will bring in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and ask how your own actions \u2013 ranging from activism to business leadership \u2013 may affect change that impacts those outside of your immediate world. Who is a truly global citizen: Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, or Hillary Clinton? How would we assess their reach? How do you decenter your perspective and see the world from another point of view? As part of the seminar we will travel to NYU\u2019s Constance Milstein and Family Global Academic Center in Washington, D.C., to visit an international organization, NGO, or federal agency that is engaged globally.     ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost for Globalization and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004. He is the author of Remnants of Song: Trauma and the Experience of Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan and Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma , editor of the literary anthology 110 Stories: New York Writes after September 11 , and editor and translator of The Poet\u2019s Guide to Life: The Wisdom of Rainer Maria Rilke . He has published widely on photography and co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice, cross-listed in four NYU departments and two schools.      See It, Read It: Photography and Writing in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 486; class #17131)   Instructor: Lourdes D\u00e1vila   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What is a photograph? How do we read photographs? How has photography shaped history and fiction, our ideas of the self and of others? The purpose of this course is to analyze the history of photography and its relation with textual productions in XX and XXI century Latin American writers. We will begin by studying how the technology of photography (which arrived in Latin America almost simultaneously with its creation in Europe) contributed to a particular visual construction of Latin America and was incorporated into literary writings from the Caribbean, Central America, and the Southern Cone. The main objective of the course will be to analyze the use of photography in literary and extra-literary texts, from texts that use photography as its discursive axis (but without containing real photographs) to texts that play on the page with photographic reproductions. Topics includ: photography and history, photography and archive, photography and madness, photography and the city, photography and memory, and photography and eroticism. We will consider texts and photographs by Roberto Arlt, Leopoldo Lugones, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Elena Poniatowska, Mario Bellatin, Ana Mar\u00eda Berecochea, and Paz Err\u00e1zuriz, among others. As we explore how literary authors manipulate photographs on the page or collaborate with photographers, we will look at other international writers, such as W. G. Sebald. This course will count toward the major in Spanish and Latin American Studies in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.     LOURDES D\u00c1VILA is a member of the faculty of Spanish and Portuguese and a Golden Dozen Teaching Award winner. Since the 1980s, she has written and published widely on Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s writing, from Hopscotch to Buenos Aires Buenos Aires to Fantomas Against the Multinational Vampires . Her first book, The Image Arrives on a Verbal Shore , focuses on Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s use of visual language. She is is finishing a book on photography and literature in Latin America, is the editor of the forthcoming essay collection La variable Bellatin , and has worked as a translator since the early eighties, both in the field of art and in literature. Her two latest literary translations are Corner of the Dead , (English to Spanish), a short novel by award-winner Lynn Lurie about the Shining Path in Peru, and Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Silvalandia (Spanish to English).       The Past\u2019s Presence      (FRSEM-UA 487; class #17132)   Instructor: Elizabeth McHenry   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How do we remember the past? And what do we learn from it? This course will take up questions of remembering, reflecting on, and writing the past through three lenses. We will begin the semester by reading a selection of African American authors who recast narratives of slavery in contemporary literature. Reading these \u201cneo-slave narratives\u201d will allow us to think about the ways history can be retold in imaginative ways and to explore the complex relationship between nostalgia and critique embodied in the return to the sites of slavery. We will also read works of narrative history and \u201cexperimental\u201d history as a way to think through what counts as meaningful scholarship, whether literary or historical. Finally, students will embark on hands-on research projects of their own design, viewing the past through the authors, texts, locations or institutions that can be recovered by examining primary and archival sources available digitally and/or in New York City. This is a course for those interested in honing their skills as critical readers, original researchers, and persuasive writers, and for those interested in the process of reading, research and writing, their joys and their frustrations.     ELIZABETH MCHENRY, Associate Professor of English, is the author of Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies , which received the John Hope Franklin Book Award, the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing Book History Award, and the American Library Association Award for Non-Fiction. She is the recipient of fellowships from the Ford Foundation and the National Humanities Center, and is currently a co-editor of the New York University Press series, America and the Long Nineteenth Century . Her research interests and teaching are primarily focused on American and African American literary history, print culture studies, and archival research methods.       Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism      (FRSEM-UA 488; class #17133)   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course will study the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in paint, harnessing religious and Roman mythological symbolism to give visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. To understand these portraits in their original context, the modern viewer must become familiar with the debates that preoccupied 17th century European courts: religious controversies of the Reformation; dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. Understanding an artist\u2019s position at a royal court and knowledge of the pre-existing traditions of royal imagery is also essential.     WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.      Haiti Today: Culture, Politics, and Crisis      (FRSEM-UA 489; class #17139)   Instructor: Katherine Smith   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the historical, political, and cultural forces that shape life in Haiti today. Our readings will place Haitian economic development, environment, religion, and culture in a global context. We will focus primarily on the period from the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 to the present. The struggle to realize a system of democratic governance has characterized this period of Haitian history. More recently, Haiti has faced the challenges of rebuilding the material and social infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake of 2010. This has been an unprecedented period of crisis for a nation whose past has always been difficult. In this course we will give particularly close attention to how Haitians understand their world today as conveyed through artistic, literary, historical, and anthropological lenses.     KATHERINE SMITH focuses her research on religious frameworks for understanding displacement, death, and regeneration in the Caribbean. She has studied urban Vodou and contemporary Haitian art for more than ten years. Through extensive ethnographic research, Katherine's dissertation examined historical transformations of the trickster spirit Gede in visual and embodied cultures of Vodou. She is presently revising that work for publication as a book. Katherine spent two years at Brown University as a Mellon-Cogut Postdoctoral Fellow in Africana Studies and History of Art and Architecture. While at Brown, she co-curated a major exhibition on Haitian art titled Reframing Haiti: Art, History, and Performativity. An edited volume based on that exhibition will be published in 2013. Katherine is also on the curatorial team for an exhibition titled In Extremis: Meditations on Death and Rebirth in 21st Century Haitian Art, which will open in September 2012 at the UCLA Fowler Museum.      Feeling Beauty: Aesthetics and Cognitive Science      (FRSEM-UA 492; class # 17191)   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Monday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Why do the arts\u2014as diverse as they are in form and in the modes by which they appeal to body and mind\u2014move us as powerfully as they do? This course explores this question from three perspectives: from that of the philosophical tradition of aesthetics, from that of cognitive neuroscience, and from the that of the arts themselves. Students will read Plato, Kant, Burke, Keats, Elizabeth Bishop, as well as work by neuroscientists, and will engage works of music and of visual art.     G. Gabrielle Starr is Associate Professor of English and Acting Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the  aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. In addition, Dean Starr has just completed a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts.       SPRING 2013       Word and Image      (FRSEM-UA 399; class # 12920)   Instructor: Mark Podwal   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 10:00-11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This art history survey explores the interplay between the verbal and visual. The Second Commandment, which some say bans all figurative art, has been interpreted in ways far less literal and more ambiguous. With the invention of the printing press, pictures were characteristically regarded as less important than texts. Nowadays, there is much less distinction between the realms of the verbal and visual. In the 1970s, the Op-Ed page of the New York Times set editorial illustration in a new direction: a symbiosis of word and image. The \u201ciconotext,\u201d a genre in which neither image nor text is free from the other, includes one-panel cartoons, children\u2019s picture books and graphic novels such as Art Spiegleman\u2019s Maus . Words are frequently featured in modern art from the Cubist collages of Picasso to the stenciled letters of Jasper Johns. Although it has been more common for words to inspire images, at times images have inspired words. E. B. White\u2019s poem, I Paint What I See, parodies the controversy over Diego Rivera\u2019s mural in Rockefeller Center. Leonard Shlain in The Alphabet versus the Goddess proposes that literacy reinforced the brain\u2019s predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the iconic feminine right side. Readings include All the Art That\u2019s Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn\u2019t): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page by Jerelle Kraus; The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe; and Leonardo and a Memory of His Childhood by Sigmund Freud. Relevant gallery and museum visits will be assigned.     MARK PODWAL, Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at the NYU School of Medicine, pursues a parallel career as an artist. For 38 years, his drawings appeared on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times . He is the author and illustrator of numerous books as well as the illustrator of books by Elie Wiesel and Harold Bloom. His art is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Library of Congress. He has received awards from the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Newspaper Design, and the French government named him an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Moreover, he was the first recipient of the NYU School of Medicine Alumnus Medicine in the Humanities Award. His documentary film House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was broadcast this year on PBS.      Drama Criticism: In History and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 459, class # 12923)   Instructor: Ethan Youngerman   Thursday, 2:00 \u2013 4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     The history of theater criticism begins with an obscure newspaperman named Aristotle. Ever since, writers have struggled to capture performance on the page. This craft requires, among other things, a basic knowledge of all aspects of theater\u2014after all, how else can we assess something as complex and collaborative as a play's production? Put another way: how do we know the difference between an amazing actor and an amazingly written part (or between a bad actor and a good actor laboring under horrible direction)? Readings to help us grapple with these questions include many of the great modern theater reviewers (Richard Gilman, Stark Young, Frank Rich, Stanley Kauffmann, Eric Bentley, George Jean Nathan), as well as reviews written by playwrights and poets (everyone from George Bernard Shaw and David Mamet to Dorothy Parker). We also read and workshop the reviews of New York's newest theater critics: you. Students review four current New York theater productions, as well as write a critical research essay. In this way, we study the history of theater reviews so that we can get better at writing them ourselves, and we write them ourselves so that we can better understand their history.     ETHAN YOUNGERMAN is the Director of Writing The Essay in Goddard Residential College and a Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program, where he's won departmental awards for Excellence in Teaching every year since he joined the faculty a decade ago. He's also a playwright and his plays have been workshopped or produced at numerous theaters, including: Manhattan Theatre Club, The Living Theater, and The Hangar Theatre. His play, The Sublet Experiment , ran for over six months in actual New York City apartments, receiving positive dramatic criticism from The New York Times, The AP, New York Magazine and many other publications. He received his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from NYU.                           The Early History of God      (FRSEM-UA 472; class # 12927)   Instructor: Mark Smith   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     Like other areas of human life and experience, gods and goddesses are complex phenomena, requiring study and thinking. This course focuses on how gods and goddesses (deities) \u2013 and divinity more broadly \u2013 were understood in ancient literatures. We will consider Gilgamesh and the Epic of Creation from Mesopotamia, Canaanite myths and legends, and Israel\u2019s Bible/Old Testament, among other texts. This course centers on the \u201cjob description\u201d of gods and goddesses (what deities are and what they have to be able to do to qualify as deities); the emotions of deities (anger, love, fear, etc.); their gender and sexuality; the animals thought to represent them (\u201cemblem animals\u201d); the various relationships of deities to one another and to humans; the divine creation of the world and of humanity; and deities in love and war. The course also addresses \"monotheism\" in ancient Israel, namely, the belief in only one god.   MARK S. SMITH holds the Skirball Chair of Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at New York University. He completed his Ph.D. at Yale in 1985. He has served twice as Lady Davis Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.. He was honored as President of the Catholic Biblical Association of America in 2010-2011, and in 2011 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research. He is also a two-time winner of New York University\u2019s Golden Dozen Award and the recipient of the Frank Moore Cross award for publication awarded by the American Schools of Oriental Research. He has published over eighty articles, including first editions of four minor manuscripts from Cave Four of the Dead Sea Scrolls. He has authored thirteen books and co-authored three others.      Political Theater      (FRSEM-UA 476; class # 12940)   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? This course offers an interdisciplinary perspective on these questions. In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, students will learn about the development of different dramatic techniques and forms through the history of theater, about the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy, and about the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques.     ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.      Physics at Accelerators      (FRSEM-UA 477; class # 12933)   Instructor: Henry Stroke   Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     We will look at the nucleus of the atom with quite unusual magnifiers. These will involve interactions of atomic electrons with nuclei studied by laser spectroscopy, radiofrequencies, or nuclear decays. The microscopy is refined to get smaller and smaller details with the use of particle beam accelerators. These rely on scattering experiments allowing the highest resolution to be achieved. Much of the discussion will be based on work done at the European Center for Particle Research (CERN), a forefront facility for these investigations. The discussion will require an introduction to the theory of relativity, mechanics of collisions, particle physics, and antimatter. Basic electricity and magnetism, necessary for discussing both the fundamental interactions and the instrumentation, will be introduced. Decays of radioactive nuclei will lead into detection techniques for alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. Dosimetry and radiation protection will be discussed, as will nuclear weapons and disasters, and nuclear power generation. Instrumentation, e.g. Geiger counters, scintillation crystals, photomultipliers, wire chambers, coincidence circuits, multichannel devices, will be among the numerous detection techniques encountered.     HENRY STROKE, Professor of Physics, has spent a major part of his research effort at NYU, MIT, Princeton, and CERN studying electric and magnetic properties of nuclei through their interaction with atomic electrons. The experimental techniques ranged from optics and radiofrequency to more recent laser spectroscopy. A major facility in this work has been CERN-ISOLDE, an \"on-line\" mass separator which allows studies of species that have half-lives as low as a few milliseconds. ISOLDE relies on its isotope production on the beginning chain of accelerators that ends with the 27-km long LHC (Large Hadron Collider) ring. His work also brought him to look, with low-temperature techniques, for a possible  non-zero neutrino mass.    Heloise: A Woman for the Twelfth Century      (FRSEM-UA 478; class # 12934)   Instructor: Fiona Griffiths   Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      Few medieval women have been so often studied and yet so little understood as Heloise, abbess of the Paraclete (d. 1164). Her life, known primarily through the letters that she exchanged with her former husband, the philosopher Peter Abelard (d. 1142), offers a study in contradiction: she was an educated woman at a time when women were supposedly barred from education; a nun who, though dedicated to God, battled sexual desire; a mother, whose spiritual daughters seemingly displaced her one biological son; and a wife, whose husband became her \u201cbrother\u201d in Christ. Traditional accounts have flattened these rich and various contradictions, presenting Heloise primarily as a tragic heroine. Seduced by her much older teacher, this Heloise conceives and bears a child, seeks a love unfettered by bonds of wedlock, and ultimately accepts enclosure in the monastery as her last desperate act of obedience to her lover, Abelard. This seminar revises the traditional image of Heloise, dignifying her as a scholar, monastic reformer, and administrator\u2014as well as a lover, wife, mother, and friend.      FIONA J. GRIFFITHS, Associate Professor in the Department of History, is a medievalist who focuses on women and gender within the monastic life from late antiquity through the thirteenth century. A Canadian by birth, she earned her PhD from Cambridge University and has received fellowships from the Institute of Historical Research (London), the National Endowment for the Humanities, Harvard University, and the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung.      Comparative Revisionism in Historical Writing      (FRSEM-UA 482; class # 12935)   Instructor: Joe Lee   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      'Revisionist' and 'Revisionism' are two of the most widely used terms in recent historical discourse to describe particular types of historical writing. They are used as terms of praise, criticism, and abuse. This course seeks to explore the modalities of thought of both revisionists and their critics by looking at a number of case-studies in comparative historical perspective, striving to locate them in their particular historical circumstances and conjunctures. Case studies concerning specific controversies relating to British, German, Irish and Israeli historical writing, frequently involving foreign, including American, authorities in these fields, will be analyzed to determine what general conclusions, if any, can be deduced concerning modalities of historical thought.     JOE LEE has been Professor of History and Irish Studies at NYU since 2002, and is Glucksman Chair of Irish Studies and Director of Glucksman Ireland House NYU. He was previously at University College Cork (Ireland), where he chaired the History Department and served for periods as Dean of Arts and as Vice President. He is a former Member of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament and former Member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body; he also served as the Chair of the Fulbright Commission for Ireland and as President of the Irish Association for European Studies. He is author of seminal histories of Ireland, The Modernization of Irish Society, 1848-1918 and the prize-winning Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society . His op-ed columns for the Sunday Tribune were collected as The Shifting Balance of Power: Exploring the 20th Century , and he recently co-edited Making the Irish American: The History and Heritage of the Irish in the United States with Marion R. Casey.      American Gothics: Hauntings in Fiction, Film and Culture from 1820-2012      (FRSEM-UA 485; class # 12936)   Instructor: Beth Machlan   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Thursday, 9:30 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.     This course will explore the roots of the complex aesthetic category known as \u201cThe Gothic,\u201d particularly the ways in which Gothic narratives, from \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow\u201d to \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d have provided uncannily apt representations of American experience from the colonial era to the present. We will think about why the Gothic genre, which traveled with colonists and immigrants from Western Europe, has persisted in American art as a way of depicting and working through peculiarly American tensions about race, class, mobility, and desire, raising the question of how a \u201cnew\u201d nation could become so haunted, so quickly. Armed with excerpts from three hundred years of criticism and theory, we will try to locate the source of the specters in novels by Mark Twain, Ann Petry, and Steven King, films like \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cPanic Room,\u201d and other social and political spectacles such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the aftermath of 9/11.     BETH BOYLE MACHLAN is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. She has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching from both NYU and Princeton University, where she received her Ph.D. in 2004 with a dissertation on ghost stories. Her academic work has appeared in Studies in the Novel, Representing Segregation , and The Los Angeles Review of Books , and her essays have been featured on The Awl, The Hairpin , and The Rumpus .      Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts      (FRSEM-UA 490; class # 12937)   Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons   Class meetings: Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We will examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students will visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art.     AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Daily News, Kenyon Review, Anderbo , and elsewhere, and won awards from Yale University and Open City magazine. She has worked as a teaching artist in New York City public schools, and last year co-designed and taught a course at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum titled Responding to Art Through Creative Writing. She is a past recipient of NYU's Graduate Teaching Award for her Introduction to Fiction and Poetry class. She holds a BA from Yale and an  MFA in Fiction Writing from NYU.      The Cultural Work of Play      (FRSEM-UA 491; class # 12938)   Instructor: Louis Bury   Class Meetings: Tuesdays, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note:conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      In his book Homo Ludens , Latin for \"man the player,\" Dutch historian Johan Huizinga defined play as a free and disinterested activity separate from \"real\" or \"ordinary\" life. Yet, free and disinterested as play may appear, the forms it takes and the significance participants and spectators accord to it always carries with them values. In this seminar, we will read across a wide variety of genres and disciplines in order to consider the myriad ways in which people have understood the importance of play and games to culture. As well, we will explore the extent to which work--both academic and otherwise--permits, even encourages, forms of serious play. Possible readings include: articles of the sociology of sport; articles on game theory; treatises on stadium financing and design; novels; memoirs; films; poems; works of ludic, or game-like, literature; works of literary journalism; works of art; works of history; works of anthropology; works of theory/philosophy. In addition to a final research project on the subject of play, students will be expected to compose weekly writing assignments, many of them playful in nature.     LOUIS BURY's first book, Exercises in Criticism: The Theory and Practice of Literary Constraint (forthcoming from Dalkey Archive Press), plays with the conventions of academic writing through the use of arbitrary rules and procedures (such as a chapter written on the subway and a chapter written entirely in questions). He is currently at work on a book of creative non-fiction and cultural criticism entitled The Gym . He is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU and he holds a Ph.D. in English from the CUNY Graduate Center. During graduate school, he supported himself as a part-time professional poker player.      Women in Social Movements in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 493; class # 12939)   Instructor: Pamela Calla   Thursdays, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      The overarching theme of this seminar is the exploration of women's political agency in terms of emancipatory thought and action in diverse social movements throughout Latin America. We will locate this agency and characterize the thought and actions of women within social movements in various national contexts but we will also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we will focus on indigenous and other popular sectors as well as middle class movements concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle in these movements. A central consideration in this exploration is the historical relation between movements and states and the gendered logics that enter in the negotiations between the two. This will allow us to weave women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action in relation to their own notions of political and democratic gains and inclusion and attainment (or not) of economic, cultural, racial and gender justice vis-a-vis the state in each country examined.     PAMELA CALLA, an anthropologist, is a Visiting Associate Professor at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University and director of the Observatory on Racism of the Universidad de la Cordillera in La Paz, Bolivia.

Our mission is to prepare students   to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by   creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty   engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of   the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place   students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics   that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such,   they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions   we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage   intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire   intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the   wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science   launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic   principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses   (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances,   the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count   the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes   will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three   central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between   exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually   through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing;   and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting   independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They   are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the   intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to   try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Wendy Suzuki Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions  Power, Domination and Resistance AHSEM-UA 166 (class # 23136)  Instructor: Steven Lukes Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This course will introduce students to the complexities of conceptualizing and studying power. How do we determine where it lies? Who has more and who less? How do we study its mechanisms and effects, above all in view of the intuition that it is at its most effective when least observable by both agents and observers? Is power at its most effective when most imperceptible, and, if so, how are we to study it? What are the relations between the concept of \u201cpower\u201d and such related concepts as \u201cauthority,\u201d \u201cinfluence,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cforce,\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d? What is the relationship between so-called \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d power? We will look at some classical writings (from Thomas Hobbes to Max Weber), at modern writers (such as Hannah Arendt, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), and at work by contemporary political scientists and sociologists. Abstract discussion will be leavened throughout by case studies exemplifying the conceptual discussion. Cross-listed with Sociology as SOC-UA 935.001. This course can count towards the major in Sociology as either an advanced seminar or elective. Steven Lukes is Professor of Sociology. He studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate, writing a thesis on Durkheim under the supervision of the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Prichard. He has previously held posts in Politics and Sociology at Balliol College, Oxford; in Political and Social Theory at the European University Institute in Florence; in Moral Philosophy at the University of Siena; and in Sociology at the London School of Economics. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and an editor of the European Journal of Sociology. His writing and teaching have ranged over political science, political and moral philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and the philosophy of the social sciences. His published works include Emile Durkheim: His Life and Work; Individualism, Marxism, and Morality ; Liberals and Cannibals: The Implications of Diversity ; The Curious Enlightenment of Professor Caritat: A Comedy of Ideas (a novel soon to be reissued); and Power: A Radical View , which recently appeared in a much-expanded second edition. He is also co-editor of Rationality and Relativism and The Category of the Person: Anthropology, Philosophy, History . His most recent book is Moral Relativism . What is Memory? AHSEM-UA 187 (class # 19746)  Instructor: Suzanne England Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as how is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. Cross-listed with the Silver School of Social Work as UNDSW-US 79.001. Suzanne England is a Professor at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU. She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Illinois Chicago, and Tulane University. She was Dean of the Silver School at NYU from 2001 to 2009 and Dean at the Tulane Graduate School of Social Work from 1994 to 2001. Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives\u2014literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture. Making History: Culture and Politics in the Caribbean AHSEM-UA 204 (class # 11940)  Instructor: Sibylle Fischer Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. In this seminar we will study the culture and politics of the Caribbean. The class is organized around key moments of Caribbean history: \u201cDiscovery;\u201d slavery and the struggles against it; colonialism and independence movements; U.S. occupations, dictatorships and revolutionary movements; the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora; and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. While the Spanish-speaking islands (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) are at the center, the French and English-speaking Caribbean (and questions that concern the Caribbean as a region), will be part of the discussion. Readings are drawn from primary sources (slave testimonies, declarations of independence, revolutionary discourses), literary texts, film, and important essays in cultural studies/critical theory, anthropology, and history. The class will be taught in English. Reading of texts in the original language is encouraged. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.002 and with History as HIST-UA 760.001. Sibylle Fischer holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Spanish from Columbia University. She has held teaching positions at Duke as well as at Princeton and now teaches in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese and the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU, with affiliations with Comparative Literature and Africana Studies.

Her study of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) and its impact on Caribbean national cultures, Modernity Disavowed , won book awards from the Modern Language Association, the Latin American Studies Association, The Caribbean Cultural Studies Association, and the Caribbean Philosophical Association. Jewish Women in Modern History AHSEM-UA 219 (class # 23214)  Instructor: Marion Kaplan Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. This course will approach Jewish women\u2019s history from the perspective of social history. After an introduction to the normative role of women in Judaism, the body of the course will focus on Jewish women in Modern Europe and America, analyzing their history in a variety of countries from the American and French Revolutions, through the bourgeois 19th century, World War I, the interwar era, the Nazi era, and postwar Europe and the United States. Students will read secondary sources but we will pay particular attention to memoirs, diaries, and letters. Students will learn about the prescriptive roles of Jewish women in the home, family, religion, and worlds of work and social life. They will focus, however, on the actual activities of Jewish women, what they did, rather than what they were supposed to do. They will investigate the rich variety of responsibilities and tasks that women performed in the (often intersecting) private and public spheres of life, how they both preserved religion in the modern era and also mediated non-Jewish culture for their families. They will further note that women both kept the Jewish family and community together and reached out to non-Jews, joining in secular women\u2019s organizations, local community projects, and the field of social work and teaching. They will discover that women\u2019s roles were often contested and always crucial to the Jewish community. Cross-listed with Hebrew and Judaic Studies as HBRJD-UA 185.001 and with History as HIST-UA 800.001.  Marion Kaplan is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History.

She is co-editor of Gender and Jewish History (2010). Anthropology in the Horror Film AHSEM-UA 220 (class # 23219)  Instructor: Edward Hubbard Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. Anthropologists have appeared as protagonists and key characters in many horror films. Films like The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), Ganja and Hess (1973), Candyman (1992) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980), have pitted the anthropologist against powerful spirits and demons, accursed artifacts, mutant beasts, malevolent sorcerers and ferocious cannibals. This course is a critical examination of the anthropologist and anthropological research as conventions of the horror film. Through weekly screenings, reading and discussions, we will examine filmic representations of the anthropologist as a liminal figure \u2013 a hapless intermediary between science and superstition, between modernity and arcane tradition \u2013 who grapples methodologically with both rationalist and non-rationalist epistemes. We will also examine cinematic depictions of fieldwork as a terrifying, ill-advised crossing of social, cultural, geographic, and temporal boundaries. These films will be used as a basis to consider the major disciplinary problems, anxieties and even phobias arising out of anthropology\u2019s troubled place in the history of the West. We will look at the often complimentary roles played by anthropological science and the horror genre in constructing, popularizing and sometimes challenging Western notions of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 180.003 and with Dramatic Literature as DRLIT-UA 306.001.

His dissertation research, based on three years of multi-sited fieldwork, is entitled Creolization and Contemporary Pop Iconicity in Cape Verde. His forthcoming publications include articles that explore black abjection in creole cultures by way of analysis of multiple forms of ethnographic data, primarily blason populaire; an experimental piece on race and the experience of the uncanny in ethnographic research; and a monograph on the globalization of acoustic batuku music in Cape Verde. Migration, Citizenship, and Belonging AHSEM-UA 221 (class # 23220)  Instructor: Arely Zimmerman Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m. New modalities of economic organization and relationships, innovations in technology and communication, and the sheer rate of growth of Latin American migration to U.S. cities has impacted the modes and practices of identity, community and membership in U.S. Latino communities. This course examines the normative and political dilemmas around issues of citizenship, belonging, and national identity amongst U.S. Latinos- brought about by immigration, transnationalism, neoliberalism, and globalization. These dilemmas revolve around themes national identity and sovereignty, democratic citizenship, and the rights of immigrants. The class will draw from a wide array of readings in political and legal theory, sociology, anthropology, and U.S. Latino studies. By the end of the class, students will be able to articulate and understand political theories of nation-state citizenship, including its historical, sociological, and legal underpinnings. Importantly, students will have a deep understanding of how citizenship is transformed as both a legal status and a set of practices that constitute contemporary political and social membership. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 541.002. Arely Zimmerman holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California (Los Angeles), with specializations in political theory and race and ethnic politics.

She is concurrently working on new research in the areas of youth, second generation Latino/a civic engagement, and new media. Empire and Decolonization AHSEM-UA 222 (class # 23573)  Instructor: Manu Goswami Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. This class examines the global history of empire and decolonization, focusing on the case studies of the Spanish Empire from the nineteenth century and the British Empire in the twentieth century. These two great empires \u2013 the first running from the 15th to the 19th centuries, the second from the 18th to the 20th \u2013 are often contrasted as opposites: where the Spanish Empire is seen as the great bastion of medieval Catholicism, the British Empire is taken as Protestant and liberal. Where the first is thought of as founded through conquest and war, the second is often described as taking place through settlement and commerce. This course will question these oppositions, examining how both colonial projects of rule, and the nationalist movements that emerged against them, helped create the ideas and institutions associated with liberalism and democracy. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 569.001 . Manu Goswami is Associate Professor of History and the author of Producing India: From Colonial Economy to National Space (2004). Her research interests include nationalism and internationalism, political economy and economic thought, social theory and historical methods. Her articles have appeared in Comparative Studies of Society and History, American Historical Review, boundary 2, Journal of Historical Sociology and Political Power and Social Theory , among others. Rival Monarchies: Old Regime Spain and France AHSEM-UA 223 (class # 23574)  Instructor: Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub Wednesday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. In the memory of the history of Western Europe, the 16th century was Spanish, the 17th French, and the 18th British. The aim of this seminar is to tell the story of a 200 year duel between two archenemies: France and Spain from the Late Middle Ages to the eve of the Enlightenment. Both powers alternatively dominated during these 200 years. At the end of the period, Spain was still the most powerful European colonial empire and France the most threatening continental power upon the European soil. This is a story of wars, conquest and frontiers. The seminar will provide students with a dynamic overview of the rivalry of the two most powerful European monarchies and empires in the Early Modern Times, before the rising of the British power. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 275.001. Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub teaches at the Ecole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales (Paris). He is a researcher at the Mondes Am\u00e9ricains EHESS\u2019 center, as a specialist in the comparative history of the Iberian Empires. He has been visiting professor at Yale, Michigan, Oxford, Tokyo, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. He is currently preparing, with Silvia Sebastiani, a new book on the creation of racial categories in Western societies from the Late Middle Ages to the Enlightenment. He has written books on a large array of topics, such as the Jewish community in the Northern African city of Oran; the union of Spanish and Portuguese crowns in Renaissance Europe; the influence of the Spanish religious and political models on absolutist France; the historical background of Aphra Behn\u2019s novel Orroonoko or The Royal Slave ; and the challenge of writing a global history of Europe. 20th Century Music: Studies in Contemporary Opera AHSEM-UA 224 (class # 23575)  Instructor: Louis Karchin Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Prerequisite: ability to read music. This course will explore operas of the 20th and 21st centuries, beginning with works emerging from the classical tradition such as Richard Strauss\u2019 comedy Der Rosenkavalier , and continuing with the groundbreaking operas of Berg, Bartok, Britten, Stravinsky and others. The second half of the course will explore such recent innovative works as John Adam\u2019s Nixon in China , Kaija Saariaho\u2019s L\u2019amour de loin , Helmut Lachenmann\u2019s Das M\u00e4dchen mit den Schwefelh\u00f6lzern , and Gyorgy Ligeti\u2019s Le Grande Macabre . The course will focus on the interrelation of music and text, and consider subject matter as it reflects the cultural milieu of the times. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 111.001. Louis Karchin , Professor of Music at NYU, is the composer of over 70 works, including two operas. His first opera, Romulus , is available on a Naxos Records release that has garnered acclaim internationally. He has received three awards for his work from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and a Guggenheim Fellowship, among many honors. Mr. Karchin has also been instrumental in new music advocacy, co-founding, mentoring, and often conducting performance ensembles such as the Orchestra of the League of Composers and the Washington Square Ensemble. He has written extensively on contemporary music topics. The Search for Authenticity AHSEM-UA 225 (class # 23681) Instructor: David Samuels Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. How should human beings sound? This is a question that has linked ideas about music to ideas about ethics for 100 years or more. The social and ethical dilemmas of two world wars and the global spread of industrial modernity created a challenge: how can we maintain our true humanity in the face of these traumas and disruptions? In this course we will explore three areas of musical life: folk music revivals, ethnomusicology, and historical performance movements. By attending to links between them, we will attempt to address questions about the role of \u201cauthenticity\u201d in musical and ethical discourse; how concerns about authenticity have colored critical responses to various musical styles and performers; and whether, in the end, authenticity is really what people have been worried about at all. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 153.002. David Samuels is Associate Professor of Music at NYU. He is a linguistic anthropologist, folklorist, and ethnomusicologist, and received his Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Texas. His book Putting A Song On Top of It: Music and Identity on the San Carlos Apache Reservation (University of Arizona Press, 2004) was the first book-length monograph exploring popular music\u2019s place in the formation of contemporary Indigenous identities. His current work is focused in two main areas: how missionary encounters refigured Indigenous ideologies of language, culture, and aesthetics; and the ethical ideas suffusing various musical movements in the 20th and 21st centuries. Literature and Machines AHSEM-UA 226 (class # 24031) Instructor: Nicola Cipani Tuesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \"nature\"; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. Nicola Cipani is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/ visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20th-century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013). Latin America's 1968 AHSEM-UA 229 (class # 24553)  Instructor: Jill Lane Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. In Latin America, the year 1968 marked a turning point in the social, political, and cultural transformations that had had been unfolding in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959. For Latin America, as for the rest of the world, the sixties were shaped by the geopolitics of the Cold War and of anti-colonial struggles across the globe. Yet they are most remembered by those who lived them as a time when ordinary people felt, like never before and perhaps never after, that they could change the course of history. Millions of youth in student movements, advocates for indigenous rights, workers, campesinos, educators, intellectuals, and artists, along with guerrillas and other armed insurgents, were self-aware actors in world-historical projects of radical social, political, economic, and cultural change. In these years, the personal became political, politics became theatrical, theatre became a weapon, and the lines between self, art, and politics were forever changed. In this course we study the complex relations between revolution, counterculture, and authoritarian rule as they emerged in Latin America\u2019s 1968: the emergence of Brazil\u2019s Cinema Novo, Cuba\u2019s imperfect cinema, and militant documentary across the region; the rise of rock and activist nueva canci\u00f3n; and the apogee of student activism and the counterculture in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. We encounter 1968 through art, music, film, fiction, journalism and news coverage, along with other primary documents from the period. No knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is needed for this course; students with these languages may read texts in the original. Jill Lane is Director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at NYU. She a performance and cultural studies scholar whose research focuses on the history of theatre and performance in Latin America.
