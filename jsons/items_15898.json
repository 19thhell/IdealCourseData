The Birth of Gallatin                                 The Gallatin School grew out of the educational reform movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period when social forces were bringing new populations of students to higher education. Gallatin was created to respond to the needs and interests of a special kind of student \u2014 focused, self-disciplined and creative. Some were accomplished professionals and people with broad life experiences, and the University recognized that they wanted to exercise more personal freedom in designing individual paths of study.   For more than 40 years, the Gallatin approach has continued to attract a wide variety of bright, talented students with its flexible but academically rigorous curriculum, its innovative, interdisciplinary approach to education, outstanding teachers and advisers and small college atmosphere.

Your adviser ensures that your program has depth, breadth and coherence, and that it is consistent with your professional and educational goals. Advisers also supervise and evaluate independent studies and internship projects and advise graduate students on their theses.

All of New York City becomes your classroom: you can intern at a publishing company, a television station, a museum, a hospital or a theater. Besides helping you decide if a particular field is right for you, these internships provide firsthand experience that can often lead to a full-time position after graduation. Through independent study, you can design your own project and work one-on-one with a professor who is an expert in the field.

Additionally, students go abroad as part of their major via school-specific curriculum.        Graduate program offerings include TischAsia , the NYU Law in Singapore program, master\u2019s programs at some of the 10 main global sites, and study abroad and research opportunities through our direct exchange partner institutions.   Summer session programs are offered by NYU\u2019s various schools and departments for both graduate and undergraduate students. Summer program locations are as diverse as Beijing and Shanghai, Barcelona and Dublin. Some programs, such as Journalism in Ghana, Filmmaking in Prague, and Urban Design in London, are major-specific, while others, such as the offerings in Athens, Florence, and Paris, are formulated to blend together different disciplines into a single avenue of knowledge.                             Discover NYU in Buenos Aires         Intersession program offerings arise through the various schools, colleges, and programs during winter and summer intersessions, often focusing on specific research or service projects. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars took a January intersession trip to Peru, where they lived with host families and helped tackle health and ecological issues by installing clean-burning stoves, building bathrooms at schools, and planting trees. Silver School of Social Work students regularly travel to Tanzania during their winter and summer breaks in order to work at the Tanzania Children's Rescue Center, a safe haven for children founded by an NYU undergraduate.        Direct exchange programs with partner institutions allow students to retain matriculation while earning NYU credit at distinguished research universities around the globe. The NYU International Exchange Program provides students with a variety of academic venues and structures that enables independent students to immerse themselves in a culture while studying with leading scholars at some of the world\u2019s best universities.   Lectures, seminars, conferences, and events are scheduled throughout the year\u2014 around the world. At the NYU Abu Dhabi Institute, a speaker series called Conversations with Authors featured lectures on topics from the U.S. presidential election to the cosmology of Stephen Hawking.   NYU in Buenos Aires hosts a series of guest lectures each semester that helps students develop a better understanding of Argentine and Latin American culture through the arts, politics, and heritage.   A full conference center at NYU in Florence hosts international academic conferences that have included the Mediterranean diet, transatlantic conversations on Italian art, and the philosophy of mind.   At NYU in Prague , the Prague Insititute for Democracy, Economy, and Culture sponsors an annual conference that students help to organize and through which they network with experts including anthropologists, architects, and political leaders.

Gallatin students take courses at Gallatin and in the various schools of NYU and work one-on-one with a faculty adviser to design a plan of self-directed education. One of the first schools in the country to allow students to take on the exciting challenge of shaping their own curriculum, Gallatin helps students draw on the vast resources of NYU and New York City, and encourages them to benefit from practical experience, including internships and independent studies.                                                            The History of Ideas and Significant World Texts                                 Undergraduates experience a thorough grounding in the history of ideas and significant world texts, and graduate students pursue advanced study in interdisciplinary modes of thought. Creating your own program requires maturity, motivation and independence. Students seeking a combination of flexible options and an academic challenge are natural Gallatin candidates.                                                              The Birth of Gallatin                                 The Gallatin School grew out of the educational reform movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a period when social forces were bringing new populations of students to higher education. Gallatin was created to respond to the needs and interests of a special kind of student \u2014 focused, self-disciplined and creative. Some were accomplished professionals and people with broad life experiences, and the University recognized that they wanted to exercise more personal freedom in designing individual paths of study.   For more than 40 years, the Gallatin approach has continued to attract a wide variety of bright, talented students with its flexible but academically rigorous curriculum, its innovative, interdisciplinary approach to education, outstanding teachers and advisers and small college atmosphere.                                                              Faculty Advisers                                 The key to Gallatin's educational approach is its faculty advisers. Your adviser ensures that your program has depth, breadth and coherence, and that it is consistent with your professional and educational goals. Advisers also supervise and evaluate independent studies and internship projects and advise graduate students on their theses.                                                              New York City as Your Classroom                                 Along with academic course work, internships, private lessons in the arts and independent studies can be essential parts of your education at Gallatin. All of New York City becomes your classroom: you can intern at a publishing company, a television station, a museum, a hospital or a theater. Besides helping you decide if a particular field is right for you, these internships provide firsthand experience that can often lead to a full-time position after graduation. Through independent study, you can design your own project and work one-on-one with a professor who is an expert in the field. As a small college within a highly regarded research university, Gallatin provides its students with the best of both worlds. Our small size creates a strong sense of community among students and faculty and allows you to develop lasting relationships with your professors, advisers and classmates. At the same time, access to all of New York University means that you have virtually unlimited resources \u2014 a wide variety of courses taught by world-renowned scholars, excellent facilities and research institutes and all of the resources of New York City at your doorstep                            top of page                            Location:   New York, NY      Right on the corner of Broadway and Washington Place in New York City's Greenwich Village                                             Did You Know?

Additionally, students go abroad as part of their major via school-specific curriculum.        Graduate program offerings include TischAsia , the NYU Law in Singapore program, master\u2019s programs at some of the 10 main global sites, and study abroad and research opportunities through our direct exchange partner institutions.   Summer session programs are offered by NYU\u2019s various schools and departments for both graduate and undergraduate students. Summer program locations are as diverse as Beijing and Shanghai, Barcelona and Dublin. Some programs, such as Journalism in Ghana, Filmmaking in Prague, and Urban Design in London, are major-specific, while others, such as the offerings in Athens, Florence, and Paris, are formulated to blend together different disciplines into a single avenue of knowledge.                             Discover NYU in Buenos Aires         Intersession program offerings arise through the various schools, colleges, and programs during winter and summer intersessions, often focusing on specific research or service projects. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars took a January intersession trip to Peru, where they lived with host families and helped tackle health and ecological issues by installing clean-burning stoves, building bathrooms at schools, and planting trees. Silver School of Social Work students regularly travel to Tanzania during their winter and summer breaks in order to work at the Tanzania Children's Rescue Center, a safe haven for children founded by an NYU undergraduate.        Direct exchange programs with partner institutions allow students to retain matriculation while earning NYU credit at distinguished research universities around the globe. The NYU International Exchange Program provides students with a variety of academic venues and structures that enables independent students to immerse themselves in a culture while studying with leading scholars at some of the world\u2019s best universities.   Lectures, seminars, conferences, and events are scheduled throughout the year\u2014 around the world. At the NYU Abu Dhabi Institute, a speaker series called Conversations with Authors featured lectures on topics from the U.S. presidential election to the cosmology of Stephen Hawking.   NYU in Buenos Aires hosts a series of guest lectures each semester that helps students develop a better understanding of Argentine and Latin American culture through the arts, politics, and heritage.   A full conference center at NYU in Florence hosts international academic conferences that have included the Mediterranean diet, transatlantic conversations on Italian art, and the philosophy of mind.   At NYU in Prague , the Prague Insititute for Democracy, Economy, and Culture sponsors an annual conference that students help to organize and through which they network with experts including anthropologists, architects, and political leaders. Each site sponsors its own activities, which together provide an impressive calendar of events and opportunities.
