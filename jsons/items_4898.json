However, the more information you provide, the easier it will be to effectively evaluate your skills, abilities and qualifications.

If you close your browser prior to clicking SAVE AND CONTINUE TO NEXT or SAVE AND STAY ON THIS PAGE your application and account will be saved, but you will lose the information on the last page that was not saved.                                                                                                                                                                            How do I go about submitting my cover letter and my resume?                                                       You will be able to submit a resume and cover letter each time you apply for a position. There will be directions prompting you how and when to attach your documents. Please note that attaching a resume does not substitute for completing the application form.

Yes; for example, you can copy and paste the information from a Word or WordPerfect document directly into the appropriate fields in the application form.

What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for faculty or research positions?                                                       Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.
