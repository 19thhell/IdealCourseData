Students study with renowned faculty through private lessons, studio/workshop classes, lecture classes, master classes, and seminars. They perform in fully-staged productions of the highest caliber under the guidance of directors, choreographers, conductors, and designers from Broadway and major regional theatre communities. Course Work Course work includes classes in music theatre history and repertoire as well as training in voice with leading vocalists from New York&#39;s professional community. Acting and dance classes are conducted by working professionals in the industry, and classes are offered in diction, speech, audition and business skills, and stagecraft. Every semester a sequence of music theatre workshops focuses on song analysis, character analysis, music theatre styles, and vocal production. Music Theatre majors have the opportunity to cross traditional lines and benefit from classical voice training and the opportunity to participate in opera workshops as well as fully-staged opera productions. Core Requirements and Electives Core music requirements include music theory, aural comprehension, keyboard skills, and music history. The degree requires a total of 131 credits - 44 in liberal arts and 87 in music - and all graduates perform a senior recital. Our department&#39;s programs in Music Technology, Music Business, and Music Education provide students with elective courses that further prepare them for employment opportunities in the world of professional music performance. A new dual degree (B Mus / MA Music Education) is designed for undergraduate performance and composition majors interested in adding a music education component to the four-year degree. Students apply at the end of their sophomore year. Once accepted into the dual degree by the music education faculty, students complete their degree with the added concentration in music education beginning in their junior year. Upon graduation, students may continue to a one-year Masters degree in music education, where they complete their supervised student teaching internship to earn initial and professional teaching certification. Please see your current program director before contacting the Music Education program. More information here including how and when to apply.
