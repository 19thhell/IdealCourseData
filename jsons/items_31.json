Starting in the late 19th century, and proceeding through the colonial period (1910\u201345), national partition (1945), the Korean War (1950\u201352), and the establishment of a \"division system,\" we look at how various writers wrote about and mobilized around issues of national sovereignty, class and gender, and democracy, issues that many saw as structurally linked. Reading primary and secondary sources on modern Korean history, we also locate the issues being addressed within a broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and were reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.    Korean Modernism   EAST-UA 610 4 points.   Considers the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other cultural texts from early 20th-century Korea.

Japanese Cinema in the International Context   EAST-UA 614 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Studies Japanese cinema from a comparative perspective, examining the interactions between Japanese and non-Japanese film authors. Cross-cultural interactions, translations, and creative \"misunderstandings\" are analyzed by comparing films from a variety of national cinemas, historical periods, and genres.

The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts, architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary perspectives.    New Japanese Cinema   EAST-UA 616 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Focuses on Japanese cinema from 1989 to the present, or the so-called \"new Japanese cinema.\" Major questions considered include why Japanese cinema has succeeded in reinventing itself after 20 years of hiatus; how the resurgence of genres such as yakuza movies and J-horror has contributed to the reinvention; who are some of the major players of the new cinema; what specific roles socioeconomic conditions have played in the radical transformation of Japanese cinema; and how globalization is fundamentally affecting the production, distribution, and consumption of films in Japan now.

Approaches to Chinese Cinema   EAST-UA 618 Button. 4 points.   The development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state.

This course emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and sixth-generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema.    Mass Culture: Japan   EAST-UA 707 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan, largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout.    Japanese Animation and New Media   EAST-UA 708 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expression. Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of expression (both literary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre; and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narrative structure and reception. Implications of these conditions for thinking about \"Japanese\" culture are also considered.    Anime   EAST-UA 709 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Introduces students to the rich world of Japanese animation or anime, its form and style, history, popular genres and themes, major authors, and fan culture. Explores the popularity of anime in relation to the cultural conditions of contemporary Japan and that of the world.    Topics in Japanese Literature   EAST-UA 719 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Modern Japanese Literature in Translation II   EAST-UA 721 4 points.   Exposes students to some of the most provocative and entertaining novels written in Japanese since the end of the Second World War. Students see how the collapse of totalizing ideologies brought by Japan's defeat led to an extremely fertile, yet somewhat atomized, literary landscape. In this new postwar terrain, it became increasingly difficult to think of literature in terms of \"schools\" or \"influences,\" as questions of cultural and individual identity became harder and harder to answer in a world of material prosperity and cultural hybridization.    Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture   EAST-UA 722 Formerly Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.   Covers Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states. During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were established. For this portion of the course, we read seven original works in translation. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. The course ends with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the novel The Three Kingdoms. The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280 C.E.    Historical Epics of China and Japan   EAST-UA 726 Roberts. 4 points.   Mainly, a comparative study of four major narratives. We compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the Heike; and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red Mansions. These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged). Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and the larger design of the authors.    Topics in East Asian Classics   EAST-UA 728 Offered every two years. 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Traditional Drama of China &amp; Japan   EAST-UA 729 Roberts. 4 points.   Compares a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention is given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened for the class or assigned for viewing.    20th-Century Chinese Literature in Translation   EAST-UA 731 Offered every year. 4 points.   Explores the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on the culture and self-understanding of modern China.    Japan Through Its Literature   EAST-UA 734 No knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points.   Introduces undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works, starting with the 11th-century Tale of Genji, which became a national classic. We go on to read the Zen diary Essays in Idleness, texts of Noh plays, the Chushingura, and plays of Chikamatsu. In the second half of the course, we read a series of modern novels starting with Ukigumo (Japan's first modern novel), followed by The Broken Commandment, Sound of the Mountain, and The Waiting Years. Brief response papers to each reading are required, in addition to exams and a longer paper.    Vietnam: Its History   EAST-UA 737 Identical to HIST-UA 737. Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.The course begins by examining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the Truman administration's deepening commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commitment of the Kennedy administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and interpretations of them.    United States in Korea, 1945\u2013Present   EAST-UA 741 4 points.   Undertakes an examination of both modern Korea and of the U.S. role in Korea. Those who see South Korea as an American success story assume that the United States created and maintained the conditions for South Korea's security, democracy, and economic prosperity. Others point out that the United States bears considerable responsibility for the partitioning of Korea after 1945, creating the conditions for the Korean War and four decades of authoritarian rule. By examining the histories of resistance and collaboration during the Japanese colonial period, revolutionary movements that preceded the Korean War, and South Korean nationalism and the struggle for democracy, this course provides a deeper understanding of both modern Korean history and the history and culture of American intervention in Korea/East Asia. The Korean War EAST-UA 742 Offered every other year. 4 points. Often referred to as the \u201cForgotten War,\u201d the Korean War (1950\u20131953) was horrific in its violence and profoundly consequential for Korea, East Asia, and the United States. In the United States, this war is remembered as an instance of American rescue that subsequently enabled South Korea\u2019s ascendancy. What is not remembered is that it was the United States that divided Korea along the 38th parallel in 1945. What happened between 1945 and 1948 when U.S. forces occupied southern Korea and the Soviet Army occupied northern Korea? To what degree was the Korean War a denouement of conflicts stemming from Japanese colonial rule? How did a civil war get transformed into an international conflict between the North Korean People\u2019s Army and the Chinese Volunteers against the South Korean Army and the U.N. forces led by the United States? What impact did this war have on the two Koreas, East Asia, and the United States?    Introduction to Buddhism   EAST-UA 832 Identical to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.

As such, the course investigates Mao's thoughts and theories, not as products of Mao Zedong alone, but as products of the revolutionary situation in China and the world in the 20th century, and of the revolutionary collective that gathered around Mao prior to and throughout his leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.    Gender and Radicalism in Modern China   EAST-UA 536 Identical to HIST-UA 536, SCA-UA 536. Karl. 4 points.   See description under History.

Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam, 1885\u20131962   EAST-UA 538 Identical to HIST-UA 538. Roberts and Young. 4 points.   The aim of this introductory course is to develop a comparative understanding of the national independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885\u20131962. The course will introduce students to some of the figures in modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to liberation. The principal figures whose writings are studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh in order to develop a third angle of comparison. The course gives due attention to other relevant figures, such as Gokhale, Tilak, Jinnah, and Nehru in the case of India; Li Hongzhang, Sun Yatsen, Chen Duxiu, La Dazhao, and Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; and Phan Boi Chau in the case of Vietnam.    Seminar: Cold War in Asia   EAST-UA 552 Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) are the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early U.S. global economic visions; the U.S. and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon's global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia's place in \"a New World Order\"; and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we examine key declassified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy.    Cultures of National Division: The Koreas and Others   EAST-UA 567 4 points.   Asks how the fact of national division, as the founding moment of the postwar Korean states, has affected the way that national life is lived and narrated. It examines the myriad ways in which division has been formulated in literature, film, historiography, and popular discourse. Topics covered include gendered tropes of division, imagined reunifications, and division in the global culture industry. The main focus is on the two Koreas, but also looks comparatively and historically at the experiences of East/West Germany and India/Pakistan.    History of Modern Korea   EAST-UA 609 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Starting in the late 19th century, and proceeding through the colonial period (1910\u201345), national partition (1945), the Korean War (1950\u201352), and the establishment of a \"division system,\" we look at how various writers wrote about and mobilized around issues of national sovereignty, class and gender, and democracy, issues that many saw as structurally linked. Reading primary and secondary sources on modern Korean history, we also locate the issues being addressed within a broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and were reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.    Korean Modernism   EAST-UA 610 4 points.   Considers the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other cultural texts from early 20th-century Korea. Asks what it means to enter modernity under colonial rule by questioning the relationship among imperialism, writing, and subjectivity in particular. Through intensive reading of works from 1920s and 1930s Korea, students obtain an idea of the parameters of modern Korean literature and of the main issues involved in the discussion of modernity in Korea.    20th-Century Korean Literature in Translation   EAST-UA 611 4 points.   Provides an overview of 20th-century Korean literature, tracing its development under the competing influences of tradition, history, and the West. Readings include drama, poetry, and fiction from modern and contemporary periods. Includes occasional lectures on classical forms of Korean literature and drama.    Japanese Cinema   EAST-UA 613 Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines key theoretical and methodological issues in the study of Japanese cinema, such as the connections between Japanese films and cultural traditions, the effect of Americanization and modernization, the formation of national identity and specificity, and the \"otherness\" of Japanese cinematic form.    Japanese Cinema in the International Context   EAST-UA 614 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Studies Japanese cinema from a comparative perspective, examining the interactions between Japanese and non-Japanese film authors. Cross-cultural interactions, translations, and creative \"misunderstandings\" are analyzed by comparing films from a variety of national cinemas, historical periods, and genres. Some directors studied are Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Takeshi Kitano, Kenji Mizoguchi, Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, the Wachowski brothers, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and John Ford.    Aesthetics and Politics of Vision in Premodern Japan   EAST-UA 615 Looser. 4 points.   Offers a broad cultural history of Japan, roughly from the eighth century through the mid-19th. The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts, architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary perspectives.    New Japanese Cinema   EAST-UA 616 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Focuses on Japanese cinema from 1989 to the present, or the so-called \"new Japanese cinema.\" Major questions considered include why Japanese cinema has succeeded in reinventing itself after 20 years of hiatus; how the resurgence of genres such as yakuza movies and J-horror has contributed to the reinvention; who are some of the major players of the new cinema; what specific roles socioeconomic conditions have played in the radical transformation of Japanese cinema; and how globalization is fundamentally affecting the production, distribution, and consumption of films in Japan now. Students closely watch and analyze films by Takeshi Kitano, Takashi Miike, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Shinji Aoyama, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Hideo Nakata, Takashi Shimizu, and other directors.    Approaches to Chinese Cinema   EAST-UA 618 Button. 4 points.   The development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state. As early as the 1920s, film became a vital and influential site of cultural production. This course emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and sixth-generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema.    Mass Culture: Japan   EAST-UA 707 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan, largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout.    Japanese Animation and New Media   EAST-UA 708 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expression. Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of expression (both literary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre; and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narrative structure and reception. Implications of these conditions for thinking about \"Japanese\" culture are also considered.    Anime   EAST-UA 709 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Introduces students to the rich world of Japanese animation or anime, its form and style, history, popular genres and themes, major authors, and fan culture. Explores the popularity of anime in relation to the cultural conditions of contemporary Japan and that of the world.    Topics in Japanese Literature   EAST-UA 719 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Modern Japanese Literature in Translation II   EAST-UA 721 4 points.   Exposes students to some of the most provocative and entertaining novels written in Japanese since the end of the Second World War. Students see how the collapse of totalizing ideologies brought by Japan's defeat led to an extremely fertile, yet somewhat atomized, literary landscape. In this new postwar terrain, it became increasingly difficult to think of literature in terms of \"schools\" or \"influences,\" as questions of cultural and individual identity became harder and harder to answer in a world of material prosperity and cultural hybridization.    Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture   EAST-UA 722 Formerly Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.   Covers Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states. During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were established. For this portion of the course, we read seven original works in translation. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. The course ends with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the novel The Three Kingdoms. The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280 C.E.    Historical Epics of China and Japan   EAST-UA 726 Roberts. 4 points.   Mainly, a comparative study of four major narratives. We compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the Heike; and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red Mansions. These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged). Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and the larger design of the authors.    Topics in East Asian Classics   EAST-UA 728 Offered every two years. 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Traditional Drama of China &amp; Japan   EAST-UA 729 Roberts. 4 points.   Compares a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention is given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened for the class or assigned for viewing.    20th-Century Chinese Literature in Translation   EAST-UA 731 Offered every year. 4 points.   Explores the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on the culture and self-understanding of modern China.    Japan Through Its Literature   EAST-UA 734 No knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points.   Introduces undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works, starting with the 11th-century Tale of Genji, which became a national classic. We go on to read the Zen diary Essays in Idleness, texts of Noh plays, the Chushingura, and plays of Chikamatsu. In the second half of the course, we read a series of modern novels starting with Ukigumo (Japan's first modern novel), followed by The Broken Commandment, Sound of the Mountain, and The Waiting Years. Brief response papers to each reading are required, in addition to exams and a longer paper.    Vietnam: Its History   EAST-UA 737 Identical to HIST-UA 737. Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.The course begins by examining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the Truman administration's deepening commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commitment of the Kennedy administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and interpretations of them.    United States in Korea, 1945\u2013Present   EAST-UA 741 4 points.   Undertakes an examination of both modern Korea and of the U.S. role in Korea. Those who see South Korea as an American success story assume that the United States created and maintained the conditions for South Korea's security, democracy, and economic prosperity. Others point out that the United States bears considerable responsibility for the partitioning of Korea after 1945, creating the conditions for the Korean War and four decades of authoritarian rule. By examining the histories of resistance and collaboration during the Japanese colonial period, revolutionary movements that preceded the Korean War, and South Korean nationalism and the struggle for democracy, this course provides a deeper understanding of both modern Korean history and the history and culture of American intervention in Korea/East Asia. The Korean War EAST-UA 742 Offered every other year. 4 points. Often referred to as the \u201cForgotten War,\u201d the Korean War (1950\u20131953) was horrific in its violence and profoundly consequential for Korea, East Asia, and the United States. In the United States, this war is remembered as an instance of American rescue that subsequently enabled South Korea\u2019s ascendancy. What is not remembered is that it was the United States that divided Korea along the 38th parallel in 1945. What happened between 1945 and 1948 when U.S. forces occupied southern Korea and the Soviet Army occupied northern Korea? To what degree was the Korean War a denouement of conflicts stemming from Japanese colonial rule? How did a civil war get transformed into an international conflict between the North Korean People\u2019s Army and the Chinese Volunteers against the South Korean Army and the U.N. forces led by the United States? What impact did this war have on the two Koreas, East Asia, and the United States?    Introduction to Buddhism   EAST-UA 832 Identical to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.

The second part offers students an advanced understanding of US-China relations, focusing on the post-Cold War period, with a special emphasis on issues of security, human rights and economy. This part is intended to provide the means for students to develop their own theoretically informed analyses of major issues in US-China relations, such us how China\u2019s membership in the WTO affects American economy, including the quality of employment opportunities in the United States.

Experiential Discovery in the Natural World                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea - CCEX-SHU 116 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.                                Global China Studies                                                    20th Century Chinese Writers in a Global Context - GCHN-SHU 207 - 4 points                               The literary scene in the 20th centuryChinese-speaking world is diverse in sound and script, vast in the scope of subject matters, and challenging for those migrant or exilic minds whose creative energy is driven by their critical insight to the world around them. Working in,outside, and between places like mainlandChina, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, America, and France, Chinese-language writers may have in mind an imagined community of fellow countrymen when they write. Oftentimes, however, they may also ask provocative questions about nationalism, linguistic loyalty, and authenticity as Anglophone, Francophone, or bilingual writers living in the West. From andacross multiple cultural margins, they speak to probe the nature of modernity, cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. How do Lu Xun, Lao She, Ha Jin, Alai, and Gao Xingjian represent China on the world stage and find their place in this picture? Where in their works can we find stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do novels and stories by Zhang Ailing, Bai Xianyong, Maxine Hong Kingston, Gish Jen, and Shirley Lim cement or deconstruct the conventional ground on which we compare Eastern and Western civilizations? What kind of an alternative literary geography, and worldview, do these writers offer?                                                                      Worldwide Chinese Diaspora - GCHN-SHU 251 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the history and complexities of worldwide Chinese migrations and diasporic communities, including change over time and evolving global diasporic relationships and interactions. A signature Global Network University course, it may be coordinated with parallel courses held at other sites in the network, so that student research on the multiple inflections of the Chinese experience of diaspora globally is both collaborative and comparative.                                Humanities                                                    Empires in World History - HUMN-SHU 269 - 4 points                               Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a polity that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Any examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of the political structures within which people tried to make their way, sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. Empires\u2013polities which maintained and enhanced social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2013have been one of the most common and durable forms of political association. This course will focus on the comparative study of empires from ancient Rome and China to the present, and upon the variety of ways in which empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. Students in this course will explore historians' approaches to studying empires. We will investigate how empires were held together\u2013and where they were weak\u2013 from perspectives that focus on political, cultural, and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. Readings will include historical scholarship on the Roman,Chinese, Mongol, Ottoman, Habsburg, Russian, French, British, German, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities.

The forms and uses of new communications technologies, including digital imaging, sound, video, animation, and basic web development, are explored in a laboratory context of hands-on experimentation, readings, and discussion. Principles of interpersonal communications, media theory, and human factors are introduced. Weekly assignments, team and independent projects, and project reports are required.                                                                      Animation and Dynamic Surfaces - INTM-SHU 211 - 4 points                               Contemporary animation is no longer constrained to the single flat screen; it can now be seen on surfaces of any shape and size. This course takes students from traditional animation techniques to contemporary outputs. In the first part of the course students will learn the process of character design as well as script and storyboard development to create two animated shorts. The course then examines outputs afforded by new technologies, such as interactivity, multiple screens and projection mapping. Software includes DragonFrame (for stop motion capture), Adobe After Effects and Premiere (for digital compositing, animating, and sequencing), as well MadMapper (for projection mapping), and Processing (for interactivity). Drawing skills are not necessary for this course, however students will keep a personal sketchbook.                                                                      Developing Web - INTM-SHU 231 - 4 points                               The Web now permeates most aspects of modern existence, and as a result, web development has become an indispensable skill complementary to many diverse disciplines. Students in this course will gain fluency in essential web languages and development approaches through a series of creative yet practical exercises aimed at touching on many important aspects of today\u2019s multi-faceted World Wide Web \u2013 by building responsive websites, engaging games, and rich internet applications for the desktop, mobile devices, and Arduino microcontroller. Design principles will be explored through corresponding HTML and CSS structures, and will be based on a consideration for typography, images, audio and video. Dynamic data and interaction will be investigated through client-side scripting techniques using JavaScript, including the popular jQuery library. User generated content and the importance of content management will be reflected on through server-side scripting techniques utilizing the PHP based WordPress platform. Data storage and retrieval will be made possible through the application of MySQL databases and the HTML5 Local Storage specification. And universal data exchange formats, JSON and XML, will be part of an ongoing experimentation with third party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) such as Flickr, Freebase, Google Maps, Twitter, Xively &amp; YouTube.

Networks and Dynamics - MATH-SHU 160 - 4 points                               This is a post-calculus mathematics course that is designed to prepare students to enter a broad set of majors, from natural sciences through social sciences. The preliminary goal is to address the following challenge: today\u2019s science and world at large requires us to understand how the dynamical interactions between individual units in a complex network give rise to collective behavior, be it genetic network that makes us who we are, neural network underlying our brain functions, social network of friends through Facebook or WeChat. The language for providing a scientific understanding of such systems is the mathematics of network theory, linear algebra, and differential equations. These topics are integrated to provide a unifying course that introduces analysis methods and mathematical models for understanding dynamical network behavior. Computer simulations will be a major component of this hands-on course. Prerequisite: Grade of C or better in MATH-SHU 121 and MATH-SHU 140. Not open to students who have taken MATH-SHU 264.

It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                                                      Growing Shanghai, Shrinking Detroit - CCSF-SHU 124 - 4 points                               Less than a century ago, the Paris-of-the-East Shanghai and the Paris-of-the-West Detroit belonged to the most modern, booming metropolises in the world, until both cities declined. Today, the global city of Shanghai has revived its old glory days, while Detroit officially filed for bankruptcy in July this year. In this course, we take Shanghai and Detroit as case studies to examine the challenges and consequences of our fast-urbanizing world. We will explore the historical and economic factors influencing the transformation of these cities, as well as look at how its citizens are experiencing these sweeping changes.
