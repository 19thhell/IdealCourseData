Also mentioned above, during the first year, the student must secure a faculty mentor from within the department who has formally agreed to supervise the thesis research or independent project. Upon approval by the Biomaterials and Biomimetics Department Chairman, a Co-mentor from another department in the University may be assigned to advise the student.   Thesis research protocol.&amp;nbsp;The thesis proposal (protocol) for the completion of original research must be: (1) approved by the mentor and the Department Chair, (2) filed with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Laboratory Manager, and (3) presented and approved at a department research meeting. The student must have received a grade of P in the Introduction to Research in Biomaterials course.   The plan of study and the thesis research are formulated in consultation with the faculty mentor(s). The thesis must represent original, independent research in a significant area of biomaterials and biomimetics at a level comparable to research published in recognized journals or as professional monographs. When the thesis is completed and has been approved by the mentor(s) and by a research advisory committee (readers) assigned by the Director of Graduate Studies, the candidate defends the results of the research before a faculty committee. No more than twelve months should lapse between the approved proposal and the thesis defense. Exceptions requiring time extension must be approved by the Chair of the Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics or program director.   Non-thesis option. The nature of the independent project in Biomaterials must be developed in consultation with a faculty mentor and approved by the director of graduate studies.

Complex Material Systems (BIOMA-DN 1017)                               [3 credits. Course Director: Y. Zhang] Many structural and biomedical components encounter service conditions that require materials performance to vary with location within the component. Conventional design using monolithic materials often fail to meet the application demands. This course offers graduate students a comprehensive study of structure-function-property relationships in composites across a range of applications. A background in composite materials design is provided, including multiphase metal, ceramic and polymer systems. This background is supplemented by study of the interactions between micro, meso and macro structures within several biological structures as a basis for biomimetic materials design. A number of lecturers from a broad range of disciplines give presentations in this integrated course.

This grant was awarded based on a proposal spearheaded by  faculty in the recently created Molecular Design Institute in NYU  Chemistry and Center for Soft Matter Research in NYU Physics.    NYU\u2019s center is one of 31 MRSECs in the country. These NSF-backed  centers employ interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary materials  research to address fundamental problems in science and engineering.  For more, go to http://www.mrsec.org/ .    The NYU MRSEC unites NYU\u2019s departments of chemistry and physics, its  Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, its College of Dentistry,  and the Polytechnic Institute of NYU as well as Princeton University.  Its primary focus will be colloidal architecture\u2014how microscopic  particles are arranged and how they may be controlled to develop new  materials to create better classes of consumer products.    In addition, NYU\u2019s MRSEC   will operate an Industrial Partners Program, in which businesses and  corporations will become center members to collaborate with each other  and NYU faculty in non-competitive research. Members will also work  with NYU faculty in proprietary research.    Colloids, or microscopic particles suspended in liquids, are  commercially important materials for product coatings, inks, and  ceramics. As better control over the quality and kinds of materials  that can be used has improved, colloids are increasingly finding  applications in composite dental and medical materials as well as  photonics for optical computing and digital displays.    The NYU MRSEC revolves around an Interdisciplinary Research Group  (IRG) that combines theory, computation, structural characterization,  and property evaluation, which are essential to innovation in materials  research. Specifically, its work in colloidal architecture merges  investigators with expertise in experimental and theoretical condensed  matter physics, colloid science, synthetic chemistry, polymer  chemistry, solid-state chemistry, and biomaterials. These researchers  develop principles for the creation of materials by manipulating  particle shape, size, and interactions, with the aim of obtaining and  improving specific structures and their functions.    In addition to IRG research, the NYU MRSEC operates a Seed program  designed to cultivate junior faculty and bolster emerging areas of  interdisciplinary research-both with the aim of promoting the vitality  and growth of the MRSEC. This aim is reinforced by the recent merger of  NYU and Polytechnic University, which has created the Polytechnic  Institute of New York University, a school of engineering and  technology that will be integrated with the sciences at NYU.    The center will also create a program aimed at creating K-12 and  post-secondary education activities while broadening the participation  of groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics. These efforts will include the \u201cScientific Frontiers\u201d  program, which introduces curricular materials to elementary, middle,  and high schools in New York City.    In a partnership with NYU\u2019s Faculty Resource Network, the center  will offer summer research opportunities to undergraduates and faculty  from four-year colleges and minority-serving institutions.

This grant was awarded based on a proposal spearheaded by  faculty in the recently created Molecular Design Institute in NYU  Chemistry and Center for Soft Matter Research in NYU Physics.    NYU\u2019s center is one of 31 MRSECs in the country. These NSF-backed  centers employ interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary materials  research to address fundamental problems in science and engineering.  For more, go to http://www.mrsec.org/ .    The NYU MRSEC unites NYU\u2019s departments of chemistry and physics, its  Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, its College of Dentistry,  and the Polytechnic Institute of NYU as well as Princeton University.  Its primary focus will be colloidal architecture\u2014how microscopic  particles are arranged and how they may be controlled to develop new  materials to create better classes of consumer products.    In addition, NYU\u2019s MRSEC   will operate an Industrial Partners Program, in which businesses and  corporations will become center members to collaborate with each other  and NYU faculty in non-competitive research. Members will also work  with NYU faculty in proprietary research.    Colloids, or microscopic particles suspended in liquids, are  commercially important materials for product coatings, inks, and  ceramics. As better control over the quality and kinds of materials  that can be used has improved, colloids are increasingly finding  applications in composite dental and medical materials as well as  photonics for optical computing and digital displays.    The NYU MRSEC revolves around an Interdisciplinary Research Group  (IRG) that combines theory, computation, structural characterization,  and property evaluation, which are essential to innovation in materials  research. Specifically, its work in colloidal architecture merges  investigators with expertise in experimental and theoretical condensed  matter physics, colloid science, synthetic chemistry, polymer  chemistry, solid-state chemistry, and biomaterials. These researchers  develop principles for the creation of materials by manipulating  particle shape, size, and interactions, with the aim of obtaining and  improving specific structures and their functions.    In addition to IRG research, the NYU MRSEC operates a Seed program  designed to cultivate junior faculty and bolster emerging areas of  interdisciplinary research-both with the aim of promoting the vitality  and growth of the MRSEC. This aim is reinforced by the recent merger of  NYU and Polytechnic University, which has created the Polytechnic  Institute of New York University, a school of engineering and  technology that will be integrated with the sciences at NYU.    The center will also create a program aimed at creating K-12 and  post-secondary education activities while broadening the participation  of groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics.
