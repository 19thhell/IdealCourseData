Communication for Consultants Professors Susan Stehlik and Aline Wolff MCOM-GB.3311 Consultants today must be as strategic in their communication as they are in their thinking. Clients expect the consultant to listen well to their perceived needs, engage collaboratively with their staff and ultimately communicate their insights in a manner that leads to some form of change. Managing the communication touchpoints in this process will frequently be the deciding factor for success. In this course, students will take on client engagements coordinated by Stern's NY Initiatives office. Each project will be based in NYC and have an impact on the City. The assignments will require participation from the initial client meeting, through data collection and finally presenting to the client. While the course experience will entail considerable field work, students will be supported by class work that focuses on the communication tools in a typical consulting contract. We'll examine and apply techniques such as brainstorming, conducting interviews, facilitating meetings, building consensus and presenting recommendations. In this way, the course will address communication challenges for consultants and provide a forum for discussing and resolving them. Pre-requisite: B00.2045 On Your Feet: Think, Speak, Lead MCOM-GB-2122 1.5 credits   Professor David Purdy Former CEO of ITT and NYU alum Harold Geneen famously said that, &lsquo;Leadership cannot be taught but it can be learned.&rsquo; Over three full-day sessions, this course will provide you with learning opportunities to develop your leadership presence, drawing on best practices from both business and the arts. You will learn how to tell concise and evocative stories, which build trust and inspire action. Using improvisation and innovative thinking techniques, you will develop your collaborative and interpersonal communication abilities. Lastly, you will learn best practices for argument development and persuasive techniques in preparation for a final presentation. As with all the exercises, feedback will be provided by the professor and your peers. Defending the Bottom Line: Strategies in Persuasion for Financial Services Executives MCOM-GB.2103 1.5 credits Prerequisite (Langone Only): MCOM-GB.2105 No longer can business professionals rely on strong technical and analytical skills alone. Leaders must also be persuasive and credible communicators. This course, designed for students who are experienced communicators, is built on the concept of a &ldquo;career life cycle&rdquo; which blends theoretical models for effective persuasion with practical communications strategies in a simulated business setting. The &ldquo;life cycle&rdquo; encompasses a number of individual and group situations that an employee will face during the course of their career. In developing communication strategies we will examine factors impacting a person&rsquo;s career life cycle such as personal goals, business stresses, corporate situations and environmental events that must be considered to be persuasive and credible in a given situation. Exercises focus on communicating to potential audiences of internal and external parties including colleagues, senior management, clients, competitors and potential business partners. Written and spoken communication assignments range from informative to persuasive in a variety of simulated settings. Situations engage hypothetical audiences involving external &ldquo;industry experts&rdquo; that range from receptive to challenging. Strategies and lessons learned in this highly participatory course can be put into action immediately in a student&rsquo;s daily business and personal environment. Students benefit from individual feedback on all written work as well as individual and team coaching based on video recorded reviews of each presentation. Communication for the Global Economy MCOM-GB.2120 1.5 credits Prerequisite (Langone Only): MCOM-GB.2105 As the business world has evolved into 24/7 enterprises around the world, business communication has become intercultural communication. Navigating through unfamiliar cultural expectations and customs is developing into a significant differentiator for management effectiveness. In addition, understanding and working with people from other cultures will grow to be even more essential for organizational strength and sustainability. Communicating effectively in these environments requires a global perspective, which this course provides. Communication for the Global Economy introduces topics in cross cultural communication to prepare you for the challenges ahead. The course explores the relationships between language, culture and communication in business contexts, and discusses: Intercultural dynamics within companies: how does Nestle, for example, convey decisions to all its overseas operations? Business structures and corporate culture: how do Japanese regulators communicate with counterparts in different financial markets? Non-verbal components: how do Brazilian sales reps handle meetings in Sweden? Message organization: how will the current Chinese trade dispute over wireless technology affect telecommunication contracts in the US? Designed for experienced communicators, this course provides multiple opportunities for applying the concepts of cross-cultural communication in presentations and business document assignments. You&rsquo;ll receive feedback on all deliverables as well as coaching based on your own professional goals. This course will help you become a more effective business communicator while providing insight into a major business issue: communicating successfully in a global economy. Crisis Communication MCOM-GB.2121 1.5 credits Prerequisite (Langone Only): MCOM-GB.2105 What triggers a crisis and how can an organization respond as it is subjected to the white heat glare of media scrutiny? Firms constantly face risks to reputation and profits as a result of unforeseen events, situations, employee conduct and ethical entanglements. Today, anticipating and reacting to crises is a fundamental duty of senior management. This course examines the relationship between business and the media with special attention to the variables involved in organizational crises. Students develop a perspective for communication with various constituencies, especially employees, shareholders, and the media. Selected topics include issue response and the Internet; managing outside pressure, and communicating and managing during crises.

Communication for Consultants  MCOM-GB.3311 (3 credits)  Professor Susan Stehlik and Professor Aline Wolff   Consultants today must be as strategic in their communication as they are in their thinking. Clients expect the consultant to listen well to their perceived needs, engage collaboratively with their staff and ultimately communicate their insights in a manner that leads to some form of change. Managing the communication touch-points in this process will frequently be the deciding factor for success.    In this course, students will take on client engagements coordinated by Stern's NY Initiatives office. Each project will be based in NYC and have an impact on the City. The assignments will require participation from the initial client meeting, through data collection and finally presenting to the client. While the course experience will entail considerable field work, students will be supported by class work that focuses on the communication tools in a typical consulting contract. We'll examine and apply techniques such as brainstorming, conducting interviews, facilitating meetings, building consensus and presenting recommendations. In this way, the course will address communication challenges for consultants and provide a forum for discussing and resolving them.

Selected topics include issue response and the Internet; managing outside pressure, and communicating and managing during crises.

This course, designed for students who are experienced communicators, will blend strategies for effective persuasion with the practicality of successfully communicating in specific financial services settings. Exercises will focus on communicating to potential audiences of internal and external colleagues including employees, senior management, clients, and regulators.

Pre-requisite: B00.2045 On Your Feet: Think, Speak, Lead MCOM-GB-2122 1.5 credits   Professor David Purdy Former CEO of ITT and NYU alum Harold Geneen famously said that, &lsquo;Leadership cannot be taught but it can be learned.&rsquo; Over three full-day sessions, this course will provide you with learning opportunities to develop your leadership presence, drawing on best practices from both business and the arts.

Defending the Bottom Line: Strategies in Persuasion for Financial Services Executives MCOM-GB.2103 1.5 credits Prerequisite (Langone Only): MCOM-GB.2105 No longer can business professionals rely on strong technical and analytical skills alone. Leaders must also be persuasive and credible communicators. This course, designed for students who are experienced communicators, is built on the concept of a &ldquo;career life cycle&rdquo; which blends theoretical models for effective persuasion with practical communications strategies in a simulated business setting. The &ldquo;life cycle&rdquo; encompasses a number of individual and group situations that an employee will face during the course of their career. In developing communication strategies we will examine factors impacting a person&rsquo;s career life cycle such as personal goals, business stresses, corporate situations and environmental events that must be considered to be persuasive and credible in a given situation. Exercises focus on communicating to potential audiences of internal and external parties including colleagues, senior management, clients, competitors and potential business partners. Written and spoken communication assignments range from informative to persuasive in a variety of simulated settings. Situations engage hypothetical audiences involving external &ldquo;industry experts&rdquo; that range from receptive to challenging. Strategies and lessons learned in this highly participatory course can be put into action immediately in a student&rsquo;s daily business and personal environment. Students benefit from individual feedback on all written work as well as individual and team coaching based on video recorded reviews of each presentation. Communication for the Global Economy MCOM-GB.2120 1.5 credits Prerequisite (Langone Only): MCOM-GB.2105 As the business world has evolved into 24/7 enterprises around the world, business communication has become intercultural communication. Navigating through unfamiliar cultural expectations and customs is developing into a significant differentiator for management effectiveness. In addition, understanding and working with people from other cultures will grow to be even more essential for organizational strength and sustainability. Communicating effectively in these environments requires a global perspective, which this course provides. Communication for the Global Economy introduces topics in cross cultural communication to prepare you for the challenges ahead. The course explores the relationships between language, culture and communication in business contexts, and discusses: Intercultural dynamics within companies: how does Nestle, for example, convey decisions to all its overseas operations? Business structures and corporate culture: how do Japanese regulators communicate with counterparts in different financial markets? Non-verbal components: how do Brazilian sales reps handle meetings in Sweden? Message organization: how will the current Chinese trade dispute over wireless technology affect telecommunication contracts in the US? Designed for experienced communicators, this course provides multiple opportunities for applying the concepts of cross-cultural communication in presentations and business document assignments. You&rsquo;ll receive feedback on all deliverables as well as coaching based on your own professional goals. This course will help you become a more effective business communicator while providing insight into a major business issue: communicating successfully in a global economy. Crisis Communication MCOM-GB.2121 1.5 credits Prerequisite (Langone Only): MCOM-GB.2105 What triggers a crisis and how can an organization respond as it is subjected to the white heat glare of media scrutiny? Firms constantly face risks to reputation and profits as a result of unforeseen events, situations, employee conduct and ethical entanglements. Today, anticipating and reacting to crises is a fundamental duty of senior management. This course examines the relationship between business and the media with special attention to the variables involved in organizational crises. Students develop a perspective for communication with various constituencies, especially employees, shareholders, and the media. Selected topics include issue response and the Internet; managing outside pressure, and communicating and managing during crises.

Being able to communicate effectively is a vital component to many aspects of business life. This course emphasizes both a strategic and practical approach to provide you with a set of frameworks that will help you construct effective e-mail correspondence, documents and presentations which inform, persuade and influence your audience. The Management Communication course offers you the opportunity to speak and write in a managerial context while receiving personalized feedback and coaching to help develop and sharpen these critical skills.     Communication for Consultants  MCOM-GB.3311 (3 credits)  Professor Susan Stehlik and Professor Aline Wolff   Consultants today must be as strategic in their communication as they are in their thinking. Clients expect the consultant to listen well to their perceived needs, engage collaboratively with their staff and ultimately communicate their insights in a manner that leads to some form of change. Managing the communication touch-points in this process will frequently be the deciding factor for success.    In this course, students will take on client engagements coordinated by Stern's NY Initiatives office. Each project will be based in NYC and have an impact on the City. The assignments will require participation from the initial client meeting, through data collection and finally presenting to the client. While the course experience will entail considerable field work, students will be supported by class work that focuses on the communication tools in a typical consulting contract. We'll examine and apply techniques such as brainstorming, conducting interviews, facilitating meetings, building consensus and presenting recommendations. In this way, the course will address communication challenges for consultants and provide a forum for discussing and resolving them.     Crisis Communication  MCOM-GB.2121 (1.5 credits)   Professor Louis Capozzi   What triggers a crisis and how can an organization respond as it is subjected to the white heat glare of media scrutiny? Firms constantly face risks to reputation and profits as a result of unforeseen events, situations, employee conduct and ethical entanglements. Today, anticipating and reacting to crises is a fundamental duty of senior management.    This course examines the relationship between business and the media with special attention to the variables involved in organizational crises. Students develop a perspective for communication with various constituencies, especially employees, shareholders, and the media. Selected topics include issue response and the Internet; managing outside pressure, and communicating and managing during crises. The course features guest speakers from the fields of journalism, corporate communication, and communication consulting. Course work includes readings, case analyses, and oral and written reports.     Foundations of Business Coaching  MCOM-GB.2125 (1.5 credits)  Professor Diane Lennard   This course provides an overview of the theory and practice of business coaching within organizational settings. You will gain a basic knowledge of the coaching process, including how to create the coaching relationship, engage in coaching conversations, and clarify action commitments. You will learn specific strategies and techniques to increase effectiveness when communicating with others, and develop an awareness of your own and others\u2019 communication patterns. In addition, you will have first-hand experience coaching and being coached. We will examine the conceptual foundations and ethical issues of coaching through readings and class discussions. Coaching case studies will be drawn from corporate and business school settings, and from the perspectives of manager and consultant.     On Your Feet: Think, Speak, Lead    MCOM-GB.2122 (1.5 credits)  Professor David Purdy    Former CEO of ITT and NYU alum Harold Geneen famously said that, \u2018Leadership cannot be taught but it can be learned.\u2019 Over three full-day sessions, this course will provide you with learning opportunities to develop your leadership presence, drawing on best practices from both business and the arts. You will learn how to tell concise and evocative stories, which build trust and inspire action. Using improvisation and innovative thinking techniques, you will develop your collaborative and interpersonal communication abilities. Lastly, you will learn best practices for argument development and persuasive techniques in preparation for a final presentation. As with all the exercises, feedback will be provided by the professor and your peers.     Defending the Bottom Line: Strategies in Persuasion for Financial Services Executives  MCOM-GB.2103 (1.5 credits)  Professor Stephen Mellas  No longer can Executives in Investment Banking, Accounting, Securities, Insurance and other Financial Services fields rely on strong technical and analytical skills alone. Leaders must also be able to effectively communicate financial models, analytic results, and business forecasts. This course, designed for students who are experienced communicators, will blend strategies for effective persuasion with the practicality of successfully communicating in specific financial services settings. Exercises will focus on communicating to potential audiences of internal and external colleagues including employees, senior management, clients, and regulators. Written and spoken communication assignments will range from informative to persuasive in a variety of simulated settings. Situations will involve hypothetical audiences that range from receptive to difficult. Students will benefit from individual feedback on all written work as well as individual and team coaching based on videotaped reviews of each presentation.     Engage Your Audience: In-Person and On-line  MCOM-GB.2129 (1.5 credits)  Professor Diane Lennard  Successful business presentations, whether in-person or online, are based on effective communication strategy. This course is designed for students who want to become more dynamic and engaging presenters on live and virtual meeting platforms. Three sessions will be held onsite in KMC 3-xxx and three sessions will be held virtually. Practice exercises will focus on planning effective strategy; refining visual, vocal and verbal delivery to strengthen your in-person and online presence; structuring and designing content; and handling questions from both internal and external audiences. During this course, you will prepare and deliver in-person and recorded online individual presentations, as well as in-person and live online team presentations. Students will benefit from individual feedback and coaching.
