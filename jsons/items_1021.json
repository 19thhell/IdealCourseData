If you do not have a score for a French placement test already (AP French score, SAT-II score, or IB test score), your first step should be to take the WebCAPE online placement exam. This is sufficient to place you into the correct level of French. If you are looking to be exempt from the CAS language requirement, and you received a score of 600 or higher on the WebCAPE exam, you will also need to take the in-person exemption exam offered by CAS. The date for the next in-person exemption exams are as follows: April 3 at 1:00pm in Silver 412 April 9 at 11:00am in Silver 507 April 15 at 12:30pm in Waverly 367 May 1 at 11:00am in Waverly 567 In order to take these exams, be sure to RSVP and to bring your NYU ID card with you on the day of the test. Students registered with the Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) must R.S.V.P. to cas.placementexams@nyu.edu  at least two days in advance of their scheduled testing time. Read more about the language requirement, the different scores accepted by the university for placement and exemption, and the WebCAPE online placement exam below.  Language Study Requirement College of Arts and Science (Undergraduates) Students in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) need to complete a fourth semester of language study as part of their College Core Curriculum . For French, this would entail completing Intermediate French II (FREN-UA 12) or Intensive Intermediate French (FREN-UA 20). CAS students can also fulfill this language requirement with an appropriate score on one of several placement exams, listed below. Graduate School of Arts and Science Students in some programs in the Graduate School of Arts and Science may need to fulfill a second language requirement. This can be fulfilled in several ways: I.A. passing or having passed an intermediate-level language course (Intermediate II or equivalent) no more than two years prior to matriculation into the graduate program I.B. taking such a course while in residence at NYU. See placement information below. Note: The only acceptable placement tests for graduate students are the in-person exam and the WebCAPE online placement exam . However, these tests can only be used to determine placement into language courses, not to waive the language requirement. II. passing a GSAS-administered foreign language exam . These exams are administered in August, November, and March.  GSAS students should consult their departments for further information about their second language requirements. Course Placement Students who have never studied French before should enroll in either Elementary French I (FREN-UA 1) or Intensive Elementary French (FREN-UA 10). All other students must show proof of placement through one of the following four exams: i. the SAT Subject Test in French (taken either before entering NYU or through CAS after entering NYU) ii. the IB French Exam (High Level) iii. the French Language and Culture AP Exam iv. the WebCAPE online placement exam  Detailed information about each of these exams can be found below. I.  SAT Subject Test in French (also known as the SAT II French Test) The SAT Subject Test in French can be used both to determine language placement level and to fulfill the College Core Curriculum language requirement. This test can be completed either before entering NYU through the College Board, or an in-person test can be completed after arriving on campus. An in-person placement exam in French (an adapted form of the SAT Subject Test in French )   will be available on NYU\u2019s Washington Square campus during the   summer and throughout the academic year at various intervals. More information about the in-person exam can be found HERE . For more information about the official SAT Subject Test in French, including registration deadlines and test dates , as well as practice questions , see the College Board's website .
