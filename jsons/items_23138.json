Web Publishing Service  NYU departments and programs may find the Web Publishing Service an easy way to create web sites for various internal resources. Visit wp.nyu.edu for more information. Note, you may need the approval of your school's webmaster should you wish to create a page outside of your school's main web presence.     Creating Web Pages for NYU Central Administrative Units   Central administrative units maintain their web sites in the university CMS . Full-time faculty and staff, and full-time enrolled students (Graduate Assistant students who have received approval from the authorized web content approver for the specific content area on which the student has been contracted to work) may request access to the CMS using an online application.   Please visit the CMS Training and Support section for more information about access and eligibility.     Creating Web Pages for an NYU Student Organization   All-Square Clubs are required to use websites created within the OrgSync environment. Visit the Clubs Web Guide to learn more, or contact the Center for Student Activities, Leadership, and Service (CSALS) Webmaster at: student.activities.webmaster@nyu.edu .   Note: All-Square webmaster updates for the www.nyu.edu/clubs directory may only be requested for sites that are currently being maintained or for special requests to move content to a OrgSync club website. To request a webmaster update, please email: student.activities.webmaster@nyu.edu .                              Need Assistance?     Please send any questions to: webteam@nyu.edu     Note:  Many of the resources in this guide are specific to the main (non-CMS) NYU Web server, www.nyu.edu, accessed through an account on the i4.nyu.edu machine. If you have questions about a site that is not on this server, please contact your school's webmaster or write to webteam@nyu.edu for more information.                                               Eligibility   NYU faculty, staff, and degree students with current and active NetIDs and NYU Home accounts may manage web pages.   Non-NYU affiliates (e.g., web consultants) must be sponsored for access by the full-time faculty or staff member who has primary responsibility for the site.   Affiliates must be assigned an NYU NetID, as per the instructions on the New NetID Assignment page . Once the NetID is obtained and the individual is authorized by the NYU Web Team, the non-NYU affiliate will be eligible to apply for access.              Don't see an option that fits your needs?     Contact us at webteam@nyu.edu to discuss your project plan.

Formal leadership training is introduced in the Lawyering Program during 1L year, and students are encouraged to take an Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Assessment that will help them determine and develop the skills they need to become effective leaders. For 2L and 3L students, we offer a variety of simulation courses, clinics, and seminars that involve collaborative learning and delve deeply into skills-based components. The Law School is also participating in the creation of a new advanced certificate program in leadership for select students in NYU professional schools.   In addition, the AnBryce Scholarship Program , Furman Public Policy Scholarship , Jacobson Leadership Program in Law and Business , and Root-Tilden-Kern Program offer scholarships t o students who demonstrate an aptitude for leadership.                     Leadership Seminars   The Law School offers many seminars that focus on the exercise of leadership, such as the Guarini Leadership in Government Service Seminar and the Law and Business of Corporate Transformation and Leadership course in collaboration with Stern.                   Boosting EQ   Recognizing that the secret ingredient for being an effective leader in business, law, and many other spheres may be emotional intelligence, often known as EQ, NYU Law has rolled out an emotional intelligence training program led by Vice Dean Jeannie Forrest.
