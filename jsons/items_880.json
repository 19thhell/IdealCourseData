What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.

Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

If you have any questions or need assistance accessing our system, please contact NYU PeopleLink via e-mail at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .                                                                                                    Apply for Jobs @ nyucareers.com                                With NYU's automated application system, the process for applying for jobs is fast and efficient.     Within the application you have the opportunity to &quot;cut and paste&quot; your resume and cover letter or upload your resume into the system.   Once you have completed the online application, you will receive a confirmation message. This verifies your application is now in the system.   Resumes of qualified applicants will become part of our general database for future consideration, and will enable us to review qualifications as positions become available.   If you are contacted by a Human Resources representative, you will be asked to sign the Application for Employment at the time of the interview.   Please note that the application process is competitive. Applications are screened and only those applicants who appear to most closely fit the job requirements will be contacted for interviews. In the event you are not contacted, your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for other job opportunities for one year.   In addition to interviews, further screening is conducted for some positions. This may include testing for knowledge of specific software packages or extensive background investigations depending on the type of position.   Should you encounter difficulty in accessing the system or should you require any further assistance, please contact PeopleLink, NYU's new integrated service center for HR, Benefits, and Payroll inquiries, at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .

What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.

Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

If you have any questions or need assistance accessing our system, please contact NYU PeopleLink via e-mail at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .                                                                                                    Apply for Jobs @ nyucareers.com                                With NYU's automated application system, the process for applying for jobs is fast and efficient.     Within the application you have the opportunity to &quot;cut and paste&quot; your resume and cover letter or upload your resume into the system.   Once you have completed the online application, you will receive a confirmation message. This verifies your application is now in the system.   Resumes of qualified applicants will become part of our general database for future consideration, and will enable us to review qualifications as positions become available.   If you are contacted by a Human Resources representative, you will be asked to sign the Application for Employment at the time of the interview.   Please note that the application process is competitive. Applications are screened and only those applicants who appear to most closely fit the job requirements will be contacted for interviews. In the event you are not contacted, your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for other job opportunities for one year.   In addition to interviews, further screening is conducted for some positions. This may include testing for knowledge of specific software packages or extensive background investigations depending on the type of position.   Should you encounter difficulty in accessing the system or should you require any further assistance, please contact PeopleLink, NYU's new integrated service center for HR, Benefits, and Payroll inquiries, at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .

What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for faculty or research positions?                                                       Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

Their findings, which appear in the journal Neuron , help untangle the different factors that contribute to the decision-making process.   \u201cIn our daily lives, we make many decisions,\u201d says Roozbeh Kiani, an assistant professor in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cSometimes the evidence afforded us is strong, enabling us to decide quickly and accurately. Other times, the evidence is lacking; we take longer to decide and tend to be less accurate. Our brain can learn that longer elapsed times are associated with lower accuracy and should mean less confidence.   \u201cOur findings show that our brains use this association to calculate confidence, not just based on the available evidence, but also based on how long it takes to gather the evidence.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s an intriguing notion that the brain might convert its data\u2014gathered through the senses\u2014into units of \u2018degree of belief\u2019 by combining evidence and elapsed time,\u201d adds co-author Michael Shadlen, MD, a professor of neuroscience at Columbia University, an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and a member of Columbia's Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute. \u201cThose same regularities that support the intuition that time might matter also made it challenging to identify time itself as a player and not just a marker for something else, such as accuracy.   \u201cIt makes intuitive sense that \u2018time spent\u2019 would serve as a clue about difficulty; proving it in the lab was not easy though. No wonder it took until 2014 to do it!\u201d   It has been established that decisions are usually accompanied by a degree of certainty or confidence, a graded belief that our choices will produce positive outcomes. Confidence plays a critical role in guiding our future behavior in complex environments, especially when decision outcomes are delayed and rapid learning is required.   Less understood, however, is how this certainty is established. Researchers have attributed it to a pair of variables: evidence and decision time. Specifically, if we believe we have sufficient evidence for making a decision, we\u2019re more likely to be certain in making a choice. When it comes to time, the quickness of a decision is seen as a reflection of confidence\u2014the more rapidly we make a decision, the more confident we are in making it.   However, it is challenging to separate these two factors as the evidence supporting a specific choice typically affects the time we use to make it.   To address this, the researchers designed an experiment in which the participants were asked to decide on the direction of motion (up or down) in a random-dot motion display\u2014that is, in which direction were the dots headed? Participants answered by making an eye movement to either an up or down horizontal bar, directing their gaze toward one or the other end of the bar to indicate the level of confidence in the decision. The simultaneous expression of choice and confidence ensured that participants were using the same information to guide both aspects of the decision. The researchers controlled the level of difficulty\u2014the noisiness\u2014of the motion and tracked the eye movements to ascertain the choice, amount of time to make the choice, and the confidence in that choice.   Their results showed that, not surprisingly, more evidence boosted the confidence of responses. Moreover, certainty was inversely correlated with reaction times: in other words, the less time it took to make a decision, the more confidence subjects felt about their decisions.   In a second experiment, the researchers dissociated the effect of time and evidence on confidence by manipulating the evidence, so that for a brief period the net evidence was near zero. Subjects increased their decision times to achieve the same level of accuracy as before. Importantly, however, the reported confidence was lower, indicating that increased decision time can diminish the confidence even in the absence of appreciable changes in accuracy.   \u201cWe showed for the first time that the relationship between decision time and confidence is not fully mediated by evidence--elapsed time plays an independent role,\u201d observes Kiani. \u201cIn many situations using the elapsed time is advantageous. It offers a computational shortcut and improves the reliability of calculated confidence. However, it also shows that we can dissociate accuracy and confidence by a manipulation like that used in our experiment.\u201d   The study\u2019s other author is Leah Corthell, Ph.D., at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Their findings help untangle the different factors that contribute to the decision-making process. &copy;iStock/alphaspirit                       Search News                                       Keywords:                          Select a School             Arts and Science         College of Arts and Science         College of Dentistry         College of Nursing         Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences         Division of Libraries         Gallatin School of Individualized Study         Graduate School of Arts and Science         Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Institute of Fine Arts         Leonard N.
