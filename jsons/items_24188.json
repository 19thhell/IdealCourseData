The LED P&amp;D Studio renovation was made possible by an anonymous gift to the NYU Tisch School, as well as matching funds from Tisch Dean Mary Schmidt Campbell.   LED lighting is a rapidly evolving technology that produces light through electroluminescence, resulting in lower energy consumption and heat generation, longer lamp life, and improved durability over standard incandescent lighting sources. Though commonly used in aviation lighting, automotive lighting, advertising, general lighting, and traffic signals, LED lighting for theatrical production is only recently gaining wide acceptance.   \u201cFor many reasons, LED\u2019s are finding applications in lots of industries and stage production is no exception,\u201d said Chris Jaehing, Director of the Production and Design Studio. \u201cFor theatrical purposes\u2014where lighting needs to do so much more than simply illuminate\u2014it\u2019s essential that the next generation of lighting and production designers develop an intimate, practical knowledge of LED\u2019s differing capabilities. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be teaching here.\u201d   At NYU Tisch, the LED Project will replace the majority of the lights in the department\u2019s Shop Theater with LED fixtures, becoming the first theater space on campus to utilize LEDs as the primary source of stage light. The new LED equipment will include wash units, spot units, and moving heads. The full system will be in place before classes begin in the fall.   Students will participate in every stage of the LED Project\u2014from evaluating fixtures and meeting with lighting manufacturers to using the fixtures in class and in their productions. In January, several lighting vendors presented LED fixtures to the studio\u2019s faculty and students, who were invited to express opinions of the gear. Additional presentations will be made over the next month, and fixture selection will follow immediately.   \u201cWe want students to be part of this experience,\u201d said Jaehnig. \u201cWe chose the Shop Theater because it\u2019s the space where students work most often with their peers. We encourage their participation as we determine which fixtures will best meet today\u2019s needs and those of future designers.\u201d   The LED Project gives students an opportunity to work with environmentally efficient, innovative technology and will have an impact on teaching and curriculum. The system will include both color mixing fixtures and white light units. With access to color mixing fixtures, students will have a hands-on opportunity to put color theory into action. They will also be able to experiment with a huge range of color without purchasing gel or relying on what color is in stock.   The students will also have a choice of technology with which to design. Incandescent light will remain a primary tool in teaching stage lighting, but the LED Project will give students the impetus to explore another important facet of contemporary practice. Students will frequently be in a position of choosing whether to use an LED source, an incandescent one, or both.   \u201cThe LED Project offers students a training ground in which they can experiment with the best uses of both types of light, and gain insight into what equipment is best suited to different purposes,\u201d said Lenore Doxsee, Head of Lighting Design Training for P&amp;D Studio. \u201cThe initiative will inspire new learning in both the technological and artistic areas of lighting design.\u201d   About the NYU Tisch Department of Drama P&amp;D Studio  One of eight primary training studios in the Department of Drama at the NYU-Tisch School of the Arts, the Production and Design Studio trains undergraduates in scenery, costume, lighting, and sound design; stage and production management; and technical theater. Students graduate with a BFA in Theatre. The mission of Production and Design is to provide students with the skills, techniques, and experiences necessary to pursue a career in the design, technical, management, and other production areas of the performing arts.   ###                        This Press Release is in the following Topics:      Tisch School of the Arts           Type: Press Release            Press Contact:                Shonna Keogan | (212) 998-6796                                                            Search News                                       Keywords:                          Select a School             Arts and Science         College of Arts and Science         College of Dentistry         College of Nursing         Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences         Division of Libraries         Gallatin School of Individualized Study         Graduate School of Arts and Science         Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Institute of Fine Arts         Leonard N.

The LED P&amp;D Studio renovation was made possible by an anonymous gift to the NYU Tisch School, as well as matching funds from Tisch Dean Mary Schmidt Campbell.   LED lighting is a rapidly evolving technology that produces light through electroluminescence, resulting in lower energy consumption and heat generation, longer lamp life, and improved durability over standard incandescent lighting sources. Though commonly used in aviation lighting, automotive lighting, advertising, general lighting, and traffic signals, LED lighting for theatrical production is only recently gaining wide acceptance.   \u201cFor many reasons, LED\u2019s are finding applications in lots of industries and stage production is no exception,\u201d said Chris Jaehing, Director of the Production and Design Studio. \u201cFor theatrical purposes\u2014where lighting needs to do so much more than simply illuminate\u2014it\u2019s essential that the next generation of lighting and production designers develop an intimate, practical knowledge of LED\u2019s differing capabilities. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be teaching here.\u201d   At NYU Tisch, the LED Project will replace the majority of the lights in the department\u2019s Shop Theater with LED fixtures, becoming the first theater space on campus to utilize LEDs as the primary source of stage light. The new LED equipment will include wash units, spot units, and moving heads. The full system will be in place before classes begin in the fall.   Students will participate in every stage of the LED Project\u2014from evaluating fixtures and meeting with lighting manufacturers to using the fixtures in class and in their productions. In January, several lighting vendors presented LED fixtures to the studio\u2019s faculty and students, who were invited to express opinions of the gear. Additional presentations will be made over the next month, and fixture selection will follow immediately.   \u201cWe want students to be part of this experience,\u201d said Jaehnig. \u201cWe chose the Shop Theater because it\u2019s the space where students work most often with their peers. We encourage their participation as we determine which fixtures will best meet today\u2019s needs and those of future designers.\u201d   The LED Project gives students an opportunity to work with environmentally efficient, innovative technology and will have an impact on teaching and curriculum. The system will include both color mixing fixtures and white light units. With access to color mixing fixtures, students will have a hands-on opportunity to put color theory into action. They will also be able to experiment with a huge range of color without purchasing gel or relying on what color is in stock.   The students will also have a choice of technology with which to design. Incandescent light will remain a primary tool in teaching stage lighting, but the LED Project will give students the impetus to explore another important facet of contemporary practice. Students will frequently be in a position of choosing whether to use an LED source, an incandescent one, or both.   \u201cThe LED Project offers students a training ground in which they can experiment with the best uses of both types of light, and gain insight into what equipment is best suited to different purposes,\u201d said Lenore Doxsee, Head of Lighting Design Training for P&amp;D Studio. \u201cThe initiative will inspire new learning in both the technological and artistic areas of lighting design.\u201d   About the NYU Tisch Department of Drama P&amp;D Studio  One of eight primary training studios in the Department of Drama at the NYU-Tisch School of the Arts, the Production and Design Studio trains undergraduates in scenery, costume, lighting, and sound design; stage and production management; and technical theater. Students graduate with a BFA in Theatre. The mission of Production and Design is to provide students with the skills, techniques, and experiences necessary to pursue a career in the design, technical, management, and other production areas of the performing arts.   ###                        This Press Release is in the following Topics:      Tisch School of the Arts           Type: Press Release            Press Contact:                Shonna Keogan | (212) 998-6796                                                            Search News                                       Keywords:                          Select a School             Arts and Science         College of Arts and Science         College of Dentistry         College of Nursing         Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences         Division of Libraries         Gallatin School of Individualized Study         Graduate School of Arts and Science         Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Institute of Fine Arts         Leonard N.

An event celebrating the launch will take place at NYU Washington, D.C. on September 25 titled \u201c When Reporting is a Crime: National Security and the Press After Snowden and Sterling .\u201d   Ryan Goodman , Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Professor of Law, is co-editor-in-chief of the new blog along with Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law. Just Security\u2019s primary audience includes governmental officials and legislators, foreign policy experts, and journalists who work on U.S. national security and international affairs.   \u201cWe wanted to create a platform that brings together some of the world\u2019s leading legal experts to provide rapid reactions to tough national security problems facing decision-makers inside and outside government,\u201d said Goodman, who has written extensively on the issue of targeted killings and detention authority, and whose work has dealt with the evaluation of human rights treaties and the law of armed conflict.   Just Security will provide balanced and broad perspectives that include: constitutional analyses of major legislation and executive actions; information about the impact of U.S. national security policies inside foreign countries; and scrutiny of international legal developments that could affect U.S. actions.   Led by Goodman and Vladeck, Just Security has lined up a number of founding editors and guest posts from individuals with significant U.S. government experience, including Harold Koh, former legal advisor to the Department of State, Ambassador Cameron Munter, and Mary DeRosa, Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and Legal Adviser to the National Security Counsel; civil society attorneys like Shaheed Fatima (U.K.) and Hina Shamsi (U.S.); law professors like Orin Kerr and Michael Schmitt; and other leading voices like Jennifer Granick, Luis Moreno Ocampo, and Julian Sanchez.   The board of editors for Just Security includes a number of NYU Law faculty whose work is closely tied to issues of national security: Philip Alston , John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law; Sarah Knuckey , Research Director of the Law School\u2019s Center for Human Rights and Global Justice (CHRGJ); Meg Satterthwaite , Professor of Clinical Law; Stephen Schulhofer , Robert B.

An event celebrating the launch will take place at NYU Washington, D.C. on September 25 titled \u201c When Reporting is a Crime: National Security and the Press After Snowden and Sterling .\u201d   Ryan Goodman , Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Professor of Law, is co-editor-in-chief of the new blog along with Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law. Just Security\u2019s primary audience includes governmental officials and legislators, foreign policy experts, and journalists who work on U.S. national security and international affairs.   \u201cWe wanted to create a platform that brings together some of the world\u2019s leading legal experts to provide rapid reactions to tough national security problems facing decision-makers inside and outside government,\u201d said Goodman, who has written extensively on the issue of targeted killings and detention authority, and whose work has dealt with the evaluation of human rights treaties and the law of armed conflict.   Just Security will provide balanced and broad perspectives that include: constitutional analyses of major legislation and executive actions; information about the impact of U.S. national security policies inside foreign countries; and scrutiny of international legal developments that could affect U.S. actions.   Led by Goodman and Vladeck, Just Security has lined up a number of founding editors and guest posts from individuals with significant U.S. government experience, including Harold Koh, former legal advisor to the Department of State, Ambassador Cameron Munter, and Mary DeRosa, Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and Legal Adviser to the National Security Counsel; civil society attorneys like Shaheed Fatima (U.K.) and Hina Shamsi (U.S.); law professors like Orin Kerr and Michael Schmitt; and other leading voices like Jennifer Granick, Luis Moreno Ocampo, and Julian Sanchez.   The board of editors for Just Security includes a number of NYU Law faculty whose work is closely tied to issues of national security: Philip Alston , John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law; Sarah Knuckey , Research Director of the Law School\u2019s Center for Human Rights and Global Justice (CHRGJ); Meg Satterthwaite , Professor of Clinical Law; Stephen Schulhofer , Robert B. McKay Professor of Law; and University Professor Jeremy Waldron . In advance of its launch, the blog has established a presence on Twitter as @just_security .   The launch event, a roundtable discussion about national security leaks and the press, will feature panelists including New York Times Washington correspondent Charlie Savage, Slate senior editor Dahlia Lithwick, Kenneth Wainstein, former Assistant Attorney General to President George W. Bush, Bob Corn-Revere, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute specializing in First Amendment law, Lucy Dalglish, dean of the University of Maryland\u2019s College of Journalism and former executive director of the Reporter\u2019s Committee for Freedom of the Press, and Gabriel Schoenfeld, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former senior advisor to presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

An event celebrating the launch will take place at NYU Washington, D.C. on September 25 titled \u201c When Reporting is a Crime: National Security and the Press After Snowden and Sterling .\u201d   Ryan Goodman , Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Professor of Law, is co-editor-in-chief of the new blog along with Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law. Just Security\u2019s primary audience includes governmental officials and legislators, foreign policy experts, and journalists who work on U.S. national security and international affairs.   \u201cWe wanted to create a platform that brings together some of the world\u2019s leading legal experts to provide rapid reactions to tough national security problems facing decision-makers inside and outside government,\u201d said Goodman, who has written extensively on the issue of targeted killings and detention authority, and whose work has dealt with the evaluation of human rights treaties and the law of armed conflict.   Just Security will provide balanced and broad perspectives that include: constitutional analyses of major legislation and executive actions; information about the impact of U.S. national security policies inside foreign countries; and scrutiny of international legal developments that could affect U.S. actions.   Led by Goodman and Vladeck, Just Security has lined up a number of founding editors and guest posts from individuals with significant U.S. government experience, including Harold Koh, former legal advisor to the Department of State, Ambassador Cameron Munter, and Mary DeRosa, Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and Legal Adviser to the National Security Counsel; civil society attorneys like Shaheed Fatima (U.K.) and Hina Shamsi (U.S.); law professors like Orin Kerr and Michael Schmitt; and other leading voices like Jennifer Granick, Luis Moreno Ocampo, and Julian Sanchez.   The board of editors for Just Security includes a number of NYU Law faculty whose work is closely tied to issues of national security: Philip Alston , John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law; Sarah Knuckey , Research Director of the Law School\u2019s Center for Human Rights and Global Justice (CHRGJ); Meg Satterthwaite , Professor of Clinical Law; Stephen Schulhofer , Robert B. McKay Professor of Law; and University Professor Jeremy Waldron . In advance of its launch, the blog has established a presence on Twitter as @just_security .   The launch event, a roundtable discussion about national security leaks and the press, will feature panelists including New York Times Washington correspondent Charlie Savage, Slate senior editor Dahlia Lithwick, Kenneth Wainstein, former Assistant Attorney General to President George W. Bush, Bob Corn-Revere, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute specializing in First Amendment law, Lucy Dalglish, dean of the University of Maryland\u2019s College of Journalism and former executive director of the Reporter\u2019s Committee for Freedom of the Press, and Gabriel Schoenfeld, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former senior advisor to presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

The LED P&amp;D Studio renovation was made possible by an anonymous gift to the NYU Tisch School, as well as matching funds from Tisch Dean Mary Schmidt Campbell.   LED lighting is a rapidly evolving technology that produces light through electroluminescence, resulting in lower energy consumption and heat generation, longer lamp life, and improved durability over standard incandescent lighting sources. Though commonly used in aviation lighting, automotive lighting, advertising, general lighting, and traffic signals, LED lighting for theatrical production is only recently gaining wide acceptance.   \u201cFor many reasons, LED\u2019s are finding applications in lots of industries and stage production is no exception,\u201d said Chris Jaehing, Director of the Production and Design Studio. \u201cFor theatrical purposes\u2014where lighting needs to do so much more than simply illuminate\u2014it\u2019s essential that the next generation of lighting and production designers develop an intimate, practical knowledge of LED\u2019s differing capabilities. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be teaching here.\u201d   At NYU Tisch, the LED Project will replace the majority of the lights in the department\u2019s Shop Theater with LED fixtures, becoming the first theater space on campus to utilize LEDs as the primary source of stage light. The new LED equipment will include wash units, spot units, and moving heads. The full system will be in place before classes begin in the fall.   Students will participate in every stage of the LED Project\u2014from evaluating fixtures and meeting with lighting manufacturers to using the fixtures in class and in their productions. In January, several lighting vendors presented LED fixtures to the studio\u2019s faculty and students, who were invited to express opinions of the gear. Additional presentations will be made over the next month, and fixture selection will follow immediately.   \u201cWe want students to be part of this experience,\u201d said Jaehnig. \u201cWe chose the Shop Theater because it\u2019s the space where students work most often with their peers. We encourage their participation as we determine which fixtures will best meet today\u2019s needs and those of future designers.\u201d   The LED Project gives students an opportunity to work with environmentally efficient, innovative technology and will have an impact on teaching and curriculum. The system will include both color mixing fixtures and white light units. With access to color mixing fixtures, students will have a hands-on opportunity to put color theory into action. They will also be able to experiment with a huge range of color without purchasing gel or relying on what color is in stock.   The students will also have a choice of technology with which to design. Incandescent light will remain a primary tool in teaching stage lighting, but the LED Project will give students the impetus to explore another important facet of contemporary practice. Students will frequently be in a position of choosing whether to use an LED source, an incandescent one, or both.   \u201cThe LED Project offers students a training ground in which they can experiment with the best uses of both types of light, and gain insight into what equipment is best suited to different purposes,\u201d said Lenore Doxsee, Head of Lighting Design Training for P&amp;D Studio. \u201cThe initiative will inspire new learning in both the technological and artistic areas of lighting design.\u201d   About the NYU Tisch Department of Drama P&amp;D Studio  One of eight primary training studios in the Department of Drama at the NYU-Tisch School of the Arts, the Production and Design Studio trains undergraduates in scenery, costume, lighting, and sound design; stage and production management; and technical theater. Students graduate with a BFA in Theatre. The mission of Production and Design is to provide students with the skills, techniques, and experiences necessary to pursue a career in the design, technical, management, and other production areas of the performing arts.   ###                        This Press Release is in the following Topics:      Tisch School of the Arts           Type: Press Release            Press Contact:                Shonna Keogan | (212) 998-6796                                                            Search News                                       Keywords:                          Select a School             Arts and Science         College of Arts and Science         College of Dentistry         College of Nursing         Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences         Division of Libraries         Gallatin School of Individualized Study         Graduate School of Arts and Science         Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Institute of Fine Arts         Leonard N.
