The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.    Texts and Ideas This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP American History, European History or World History with a score of 4 or 5       NYUSteinhardt courses that will satisfy the Texts and Ideas requirement:       PHED-UE 10 / LIBAR-UE 501 Learning and the Meaning of Life       All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .

Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. Quantitative Reasoning/Mathematics Requirement This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores. **Please note that students in the Global Public Health/MCC major must take UGPH-GU 20 Biostatistics for Public Health.

The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.

Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes.

The seminar is designed especially for students preparing for careers in teaching - in both public &amp; private/religious schools, educational administration, educational research, or other professions which will involve them in the ongoing public debates about the uneasy relationship of religion &amp; public education in the United States &amp; other countries. The course will examine these issues historically &amp; in terms of current policy debates &amp; students will be asked to make connections to their own educational practice.           Expressive Culture          ARTCR-UE.10 &ndash; Art: Practice and Ideas (4 pts)    Mon 11:15-2:45pm    &ldquo;Art: Practice and Ideas&rdquo; examines key developments in the visual arts from modernity to the present. Focusing on the ways in which representations both create and reflect the values of a society, the course introduces students to the full range of expressive possibilities within the visual arts, covering painting and sculpture, as well as photography, film, video, conceptual art, and computer media. Topics to be covered include classical, modern, and postmodern relationships to politics, vision, the mind, the body, psychology, gender, difference, and technological innovation. Students will see and understand how artists have integrated perceptions of their historical moment, as well as physical and social space, into creative practices that have, in turn, had a significant impact on the culture of the time.        ARTCR-UE.55 &ndash; Art of Now (4 pts)    Tue 12:30-4pm    This course examines the current developments in contemporary art over the past decade &ndash; the art of &lsquo;now&rsquo; &ndash; from the viewpoint of an artist&rsquo;s practice and working ideas, looking at current global art production in aesthetic, economic, and social contexts. The major movements in painting, photography, sculpture, installation and performance are examined. Readings will be drawn from first hand interviews and point-of-view accounts, reviews, and critique; a major emphasis on interviews and online studio visits will accompany the texts. Guest artist lectures and off-site museum and gallery viewings will complement the weekly visual presentations and theory conversations.        MPADE-UE.1278 &ndash; Dance as an Art Form (3 pts)    Mon/Wed 12:30-1:45pm    Dance is an integral and defining component of cultures throughout the world and throughout history. This course introduces students to dance as a live and performing art through a variety of experiences including attendance at live performances, examination of videos and theoretical texts, and physical participation in the practice and performance of dance. Through discussions, written assignments, and the creation of original dance compositions, students will explore the history and cultural relevance of a variety of forms of dance within their own lives, larger society, and the global community beyond.
