This chart shows seven modes of transportation which contribute substantially to New York\u2019s transportation needs; the list is not exhaustive but attempts to include the most important modes.\u00a0 Many statistics on transportation provide the number of \u2018trips\u2019 made per day to indicate the rate of use. \u00a0This chart instead shows the total \u2018person-miles\u2019 traveled per day.\u00a0 This method provides a different picture of transportation in New York City.\u00a0 For example private cars only account for roughly 35% of trips in NYC; however, this mode also provides the longest trips (8.9 miles on average).\u00a0 A breakout of person-miles shows that private cars actually account for 59 million miles per day of travel, more than the other six modes combined.   New York City is likely the most transit rich city in North America, but NYC as a whole is still very much auto-dependent.\u00a0 This may be troubling to those who point to NYC as providing a post automobile lifestyle. \u00a0However, it can also serve as an encouragement to those who see value in expanding other modes of transportation; there is still a huge space available to create a city that drives less and uses public and sustainable modes much more.    * Data Notes:       Pedestrian data only records trips to and from work (note the briefcase), if all walking trips were included this figure would be higher.

The NYC Mayoral Transportation Forum                  [ Posted on June 19, 2013  by  nolan ]                              Earlier today, UTRC hosted a panel discussion to ask mayoral candidates about their transportation policies. In attendance was Sal Alabanese, John Liu, Bill Thompson, and Anthony Weiner on the Democratic panel (Christine Quinn and Bill de Blasio were no shows),    Democratic Mayoral Candidates:      Sal Albanese, John Liu, Bill Thompson, and Anthony Weiner (left to right)   and Adolfo Carri\u00f3n, John Catsimatidis, Joe Lhota, and George McDonald on the Republican / Independent panel.    Republican and Independent Mayoral Candidates:               Adolfo Carri\u00f3n, John Catsimatidis, Joe Lhota, and George McDonald (left to right)   Here were some the highlights:     Most candidates support expanding SelectBusService and Express Bus Service in the outer boroughs to provide transit to underserved areas; however none mentioned creating exclusive busways to improve this service.   Anthony Weiner and Paul Steely White (of Transportation Alternatives) got into a friendly debate about cycling in the city. After Weiner mocked the polls indicating support for cycling, White said that bicycles poll higher than the mayoral candidates in front of him. \u00a0   Sal Albanese and Joe Lhota both explicitly support the city investing in mass transit infrastructure. Lhota believes that the N/R trains should be extended to Staten Island.   Joe Lhota was the only candidate to bring other transit modes into the discussion, such as Light Rail on Staten Island\u2019s Northern and Western shores. He also supports construction Metro North Railroad stations at Co-Op City and Parkchester.   John Catsimatidis said that another subway line would never be built in our lifetime, but supports constructing \u201caboveways\u201d (monorails) throughout the city.   The Democratic candidates disapprove of the \u201cTaxi of the Future.\u201d   Bill Thompson supports a commuter tax, but almost all of the other candidates believe that it is unattainable.   Sal Alabanese believes that New York City Transit should be under city control. Anthony Weiner said that the city needs more control of the MTA board.   There was a lot of discussion of tolling in the city, with candidates divided about additional tolls in the city, particularly on the East River bridges.   Anthony Weiner noted that the city pays $7000 per student that takes a school bus. While candidates\u00a0disagreed\u00a0about labor costs, many mentioned that inefficient routing was a large reason for the high costs of school buses.        Democratic Mayoral Candidate Anthony Weiner fields questions from the press after the panel.

There was active participation from a broad range of stakeholders including the city&#8217;s transportation and IT agencies, leading bicycling advocates, and civic tech and hacker groups. In the coming months, the Rudin Center will be developing a research plan devoted to improving the supply and quality of data for bicycle research in New York City.
