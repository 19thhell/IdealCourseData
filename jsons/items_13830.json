Located in Copenhagen\u2019s bustling city center, the Faculty of Law maintains a wide variety of course offerings in English which are typically followed by both Danish and Guest students.   Two NYU Law students may study at The University of Copenhagen each semester. The program is open to second- and third-year students only who have spent at least one full-year at NYU School of Law. Courses are taught in English.   Founded in 1479, the University of Copenhagen Law Faculty . currently provides legal education to some 4,500 students. The Law Faculty is known for its focus on research-based education, as well as for its emphasis on the interaction between Danish, EU and international law. Recently, the Faculty of Law introduced a number of new global initiatives in hopes of promoting international dialogue and facilitating cross-cultural exchanges. The Faculty\u2019s website can be accessed here .   The Danes are famous for being the happiest people in the world, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the capital city of Copenhagen, which is consistently rated at the top of the charts when it comes to quality of life and environmental friendliness. The city\u2019s laid-back atmosphere and various tourist attractions, such as Tivoli Gardens and the Danish Royal Theater, combine to offer visitors a charming, unique \u2014 and of course, happy \u2014 stay in Copenhagen.     Dates   The following is an approximation of the academic calendar:           Fall Semester           Early August:   Pre-semester Danish language course begins and Orientation       Beginning of September:   Classes begin       Mid-October:   Autumn holiday       Mid December:   Classes end       December:   Examinations are completed shortly before Christmas         Spring Semester           Early January:   Pre-semester Danish language course begins       Beginning of February:   Semester begins       Mid-May:   Classes end       Mid-May:   Examinations start and continue a month ahead           Courses and Credits   A full-time semester study load at the Faculty of Law corresponds to three courses. All courses have the duration of one term and consist of 34 classroom hours. Each course is valued with 10 ECTS-credits (European Community Course Credit Transfer System). For one term, 30 ECTS-credits are required for a full-time study load and 60 ECTS-credits per academic year. In order to ensure compliance with all ABA regulations, NYU School of Law requires that all courses be approved by our office before your schedule has been finalized.   Some Law Faculty courses run for 9 weeks and some for 12 weeks. However, all Copenhagen law courses in English consist of 34 classroom hours of instruction.   NYU Law exchange students will receive credit for courses taken at the University of Copenhagen. However, these courses will not count towards the student's GPA. They will only appear on NYU transcripts as credits earned through the exchange program, rather than as individual courses at University of Copenhagen.     Tuition and Living Expenses   Because this is a revenue-neutral exchange program, participating NYU Law students will pay New York University the normal tuition for a 12 credit-hour semester at NYU Law.   Below are estimates of what you might spend living in Copenhagen.     Housing: DKK 3,000 - 4,800 per month   Board: DKK 1,500 - 2,000 per month   Books/study materials: DKK 1,500-2,000 per semester   Local transportation: DKK 360 per month   Estimated pocket money: DKK 2,000 per month     See additional information here .     Housing   If you need assistance from the University in finding a place to stay in Copenhagen, you must indicate this when you apply for admission online. If you have applied within the application deadline, a housing offer will be sent to your University of Copenhagen e-mail account. It is therefore very important that you check your e-mail regularly. For more information, go to the housing page in University of Copenhagen\u2019s website.   Due to the large number of applicants, you may receive a housing offer as late as one month before the beginning of your studies. If you have not heard from the housing coordinators two weeks prior to your arrival, please feel free to contact them at: int-housing@adm.ku.dk .   If, however, you choose not to accept your housing offer, or you do not respond to the housing offer within the deadline stated in the offer, the University will not be able to guarantee you another offer. All housing applicants will be offered housing according to their period of study. As there is no on-campus housing at the University of Copenhagen and as the university buildings are located in various parts of the city, it is quite normal to have some travelling time. The general means of transportation in Copenhagen is biking or public transportation.  See additional information at http://studies.ku.dk/housing/   Passport, Visa and Residence Permit Requirements   If you are not an EU/EEA citizen and not a Nordic citizen, you need a residence permit (visa) to study in Denmark. However, citizens from some non-EU-countries can enter Denmark prior to having obtained a visa, while others must have a visa to enter Denmark.   American citizens do not need a visa to enter Denmark. However, we strongly recommend that students apply for the residence permit immediately upon receipt of their acceptance package while still in their home country, as other formalities with the Danish authorities are based on the residence permit and take some time.   Along with your letter of admission, you will receive an application form (ST1) as well as instruction on how to apply. Please contact the nearest Danish embassy or general consulate immediately to apply for your permit, as the application process usually takes a considerable length of time (2-3 months). Also, please be aware that the Danish Immigration Authorities require documentation of your ability to support yourself financially during the length of your stay. Prior to your departure, you may be requested to provide documentation from your bank certifying that you have the equivalent of DKK 4,200 per month during your intended stay.   When you submit the ST1 application form you must create a case order ID and pay a fee online according to the guidelines from the Danish Immigration Service . Please make sure that any possible bank fee in connection with the transfer is included in the full amount. If full payment is not received your application will not be processed.   If you applied in due time, you will receive a confirmation letter from the embassy or consulate prior to your departure. When you have arrived in Copenhagen and registered with the Danish authorities, you will receive your residence permit (residence card type Z) by mail to your Danish address within approximately 4 weeks.   All international students in Denmark are allowed to work while studying (15 hours per week from September to May and 37 hours per week from June to August). However, you need a work permit to do so. You should apply for a work permit at the same time as you apply for your residence permit if you plan to work part-time.   Registration with the Danish authorities  When you have arrived in Copenhagen, you are required to register with the local civil registration office (Folkeregistret or Borgerservice). To do so you must have your residence permit and a permanent address in Denmark. The civil registration office will provide you with a personal identity number, called a cpr-number, as well as a Health Insurance Card. Further details are available here . Your cpr-number is used to officially register that you are living in Denmark and will give you free access to medical treatment. You will also find that banks, libraries, phone companies, sports associations, etc. ask for your cpr-number to open an account or get a membership.     Access for Persons with Disabilities   The Association for Disabled Students &amp; Graduates (Handicappede studerende og kandidater) provides advice on issues such as access for disabled to various facilities and special services available to disabled students.

Located in Copenhagen\u2019s bustling city center, the Faculty of Law maintains a wide variety of course offerings in English which are typically followed by both Danish and Guest students.   Two NYU Law students may study at The University of Copenhagen each semester. The program is open to second- and third-year students only who have spent at least one full-year at NYU School of Law. Courses are taught in English.   Founded in 1479, the University of Copenhagen Law Faculty . currently provides legal education to some 4,500 students. The Law Faculty is known for its focus on research-based education, as well as for its emphasis on the interaction between Danish, EU and international law. Recently, the Faculty of Law introduced a number of new global initiatives in hopes of promoting international dialogue and facilitating cross-cultural exchanges. The Faculty\u2019s website can be accessed here .   The Danes are famous for being the happiest people in the world, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the capital city of Copenhagen, which is consistently rated at the top of the charts when it comes to quality of life and environmental friendliness. The city\u2019s laid-back atmosphere and various tourist attractions, such as Tivoli Gardens and the Danish Royal Theater, combine to offer visitors a charming, unique \u2014 and of course, happy \u2014 stay in Copenhagen.     Dates   The following is an approximation of the academic calendar:           Fall Semester           Early August:   Pre-semester Danish language course begins and Orientation       Beginning of September:   Classes begin       Mid-October:   Autumn holiday       Mid December:   Classes end       December:   Examinations are completed shortly before Christmas         Spring Semester           Early January:   Pre-semester Danish language course begins       Beginning of February:   Semester begins       Mid-May:   Classes end       Mid-May:   Examinations start and continue a month ahead           Courses and Credits   A full-time semester study load at the Faculty of Law corresponds to three courses. All courses have the duration of one term and consist of 34 classroom hours. Each course is valued with 10 ECTS-credits (European Community Course Credit Transfer System). For one term, 30 ECTS-credits are required for a full-time study load and 60 ECTS-credits per academic year. In order to ensure compliance with all ABA regulations, NYU School of Law requires that all courses be approved by our office before your schedule has been finalized.   Some Law Faculty courses run for 9 weeks and some for 12 weeks. However, all Copenhagen law courses in English consist of 34 classroom hours of instruction.   NYU Law exchange students will receive credit for courses taken at the University of Copenhagen. However, these courses will not count towards the student's GPA. They will only appear on NYU transcripts as credits earned through the exchange program, rather than as individual courses at University of Copenhagen.     Tuition and Living Expenses   Because this is a revenue-neutral exchange program, participating NYU Law students will pay New York University the normal tuition for a 12 credit-hour semester at NYU Law.   Below are estimates of what you might spend living in Copenhagen.     Housing: DKK 3,000 - 4,800 per month   Board: DKK 1,500 - 2,000 per month   Books/study materials: DKK 1,500-2,000 per semester   Local transportation: DKK 360 per month   Estimated pocket money: DKK 2,000 per month     See additional information here .     Housing   If you need assistance from the University in finding a place to stay in Copenhagen, you must indicate this when you apply for admission online. If you have applied within the application deadline, a housing offer will be sent to your University of Copenhagen e-mail account. It is therefore very important that you check your e-mail regularly. For more information, go to the housing page in University of Copenhagen\u2019s website.   Due to the large number of applicants, you may receive a housing offer as late as one month before the beginning of your studies. If you have not heard from the housing coordinators two weeks prior to your arrival, please feel free to contact them at: int-housing@adm.ku.dk .   If, however, you choose not to accept your housing offer, or you do not respond to the housing offer within the deadline stated in the offer, the University will not be able to guarantee you another offer. All housing applicants will be offered housing according to their period of study. As there is no on-campus housing at the University of Copenhagen and as the university buildings are located in various parts of the city, it is quite normal to have some travelling time. The general means of transportation in Copenhagen is biking or public transportation.  See additional information at http://studies.ku.dk/housing/   Passport, Visa and Residence Permit Requirements   If you are not an EU/EEA citizen and not a Nordic citizen, you need a residence permit (visa) to study in Denmark. However, citizens from some non-EU-countries can enter Denmark prior to having obtained a visa, while others must have a visa to enter Denmark.   American citizens do not need a visa to enter Denmark. However, we strongly recommend that students apply for the residence permit immediately upon receipt of their acceptance package while still in their home country, as other formalities with the Danish authorities are based on the residence permit and take some time.   Along with your letter of admission, you will receive an application form (ST1) as well as instruction on how to apply. Please contact the nearest Danish embassy or general consulate immediately to apply for your permit, as the application process usually takes a considerable length of time (2-3 months). Also, please be aware that the Danish Immigration Authorities require documentation of your ability to support yourself financially during the length of your stay. Prior to your departure, you may be requested to provide documentation from your bank certifying that you have the equivalent of DKK 4,200 per month during your intended stay.   When you submit the ST1 application form you must create a case order ID and pay a fee online according to the guidelines from the Danish Immigration Service . Please make sure that any possible bank fee in connection with the transfer is included in the full amount. If full payment is not received your application will not be processed.   If you applied in due time, you will receive a confirmation letter from the embassy or consulate prior to your departure. When you have arrived in Copenhagen and registered with the Danish authorities, you will receive your residence permit (residence card type Z) by mail to your Danish address within approximately 4 weeks.   All international students in Denmark are allowed to work while studying (15 hours per week from September to May and 37 hours per week from June to August). However, you need a work permit to do so. You should apply for a work permit at the same time as you apply for your residence permit if you plan to work part-time.   Registration with the Danish authorities  When you have arrived in Copenhagen, you are required to register with the local civil registration office (Folkeregistret or Borgerservice). To do so you must have your residence permit and a permanent address in Denmark. The civil registration office will provide you with a personal identity number, called a cpr-number, as well as a Health Insurance Card. Further details are available here . Your cpr-number is used to officially register that you are living in Denmark and will give you free access to medical treatment.

However you are not limited to taking the courses listed on this page. You should use this page, in additional to CBS\u2019 course listings , to help you prepare a preliminary list and backup list of courses you want to take abroad. Please note: You can take a maximum of two classes per major/concentration during your IBEX semester. Also, Accounting courses cannot be taken abroad for credit toward the Accounting or CPA majors/concentrations.    There is no guarantee that the courses listed here will be offered during the specific semester you study abroad. Once CBS publishes its confirmed courses for the semester you will be attending, you can revise your list as needed based on what is actually being offered. If you see a course on the CBS website that you would like to take, but it is not listed here, you can submit the syllabus to Stern\u2019s International Exchanges &amp; Special Programs team for approval. If the course is approved you will be notified and it will be added to the list of courses below. If a course is already listed here as approved, it does not need to be reviewed or approved again.    Please note: CBS has a separate course list for its International Summer University Program (ISUP).

Student Services                                    The Copenhagen Business School has a \"Buddy system\" arrangement where each exchange/guest student will be assigned a Danish \"buddy\" to help in getting through the first few weeks in the new surroundings. This means being picked up in the airport, help with registration at the National Registry, advice on shopping, post offices and other practical matters. \"Buddies\" are CBS students who have volunteered to help one or more international students. Throughout the semester various activities are planned for the international students and their buddies.
