The laboratory will accept samples prepared by investigator's technicians provided that the methodology to be utilized is appropriate as evaluated by the laboratory\u00a0manager. The clean room is available at no charge for users to prepare their samples for trace metal AA analyses, where the elimination of background contamination is essential. The sample preparation charges do not include the cost of consumables and instrument calibration for flame and graphite AA are included in the sample charges.     HPLC Laboratory      HPLC analysis (laboratory personnel) - $75/hour HPLC analysis (training investigator technician) - $75/hour     The HPLC Laboratory charges investigators $75/hour to run samples or to train the investigator's technician to run the samples. Investigators are also responsible for the cost of consumables. When the investigator's technician has been trained and is running the samples, the cost is reduced to $25/hour of equipment time if the resource supplies the columns, buffers and sample tubes and $12/hour if the investigator supplies the consumables.
