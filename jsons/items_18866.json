On content pages, the dominant element is always situated in the left top corner of a page. This is where the title and primary content is located. Everything else on the page is considered secondary to this main element, but secondary elements also have a hierarchy.   Separate Content: Defining what is &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;Secondary&quot;   The informational content on a Web site can have various content types: It can be displayed as text, images, videos, multimedia presentations, audio files, slideshows, or promotions. Within every content type, it is important to separate the \u201cmost important\u201d from the \u201cleast important\u201d \u2013 or in our terms, \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d content \u2013 and classify the hierarchy of importance of what we would like to communicate to the public (site viewer).   Considering the interactive character of the internet and the limited space on the screen, it is important to wisely determine your site\u2019s most important goals when choosing to publish the content.   Main text content can have other related content. For example: photo galleries or videos, interactive forms, or multimedia presentations. It is up to the author to determine what the most important, related content is and its hierarchy within the page.   Making choices is the key to successful layout. Some believe every topic is important and so it may be hard to make these choices. However, they do have to be made, particularly when one subject leads into another, or because it is easier to read from primary to secondary content then reading an undistinguished block of the same size content.           Photography   Photography used on the NYU.edu site must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website.   We recommend using the NYU Photo Bureau for University photography needs to help ensure that you have both the appropriate level of quality and the permission to use images on the University website.        Graphics   While the use of graphics on the NYU.edu website is limited, any graphics used must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website, and must follow guidelines provided in the University Identity and Style Guide .   We recommend using high-quality graphics created by designers rather than line or clip art.

The DMDL studio-based curriculum is complemented by an excellent internship program with host sites in all areas of educational technology and media.    Unlike programs that are focused on the application of existing technologies to formal schooling (such as how to use PowerPoint in teaching high school), our program is appropriate for people who wish to design the media and technology of the future for all kinds of learning environments, or who wish to conduct academic research on how people learn with technology.    Our alumni work in a variety of areas, including the ed tech and media industries, the education sector, government and policy, and research and development. Previously called Educational Communications and Technology, the program has a rich history dating back more than 60 years.    By selecting electives from a specified list of courses, students may optionally concentrate in Games for Learning within the DMDL degree. The concentration is notated on the transcript, and does not lengthen the degree.    The complete program description and requirements may be found in the DMDL Guide for the Master of Arts and Advanced Certificate Programs .    Program Goals and Mission    The project-based curriculum of Digital Media Design Learning prepares students to design rich technology-based, multimedia learning environments and to understand and evaluate their use in wide-ranging educational settings. The program exposes students to the design of computer-based, multimedia simulations and games for learning, dramatic and documentary narratives, media that support advocacy and advance social justice, the educational potential of social media, and educational applications of media and technology for international development. The program employs media design principles and theoretical perspectives drawn from the cognitive sciences, the learning sciences, developmental models of learning, constructivist and constructionist philosophies of learning, and social learning theories.    Student Learning Outcomes       Students will use the instructional design process to develop educational media for wide-ranging educational and training settings and diverse distribution platforms and channels: (a) conduct and document needs assessments; (b) make and document theoretically-grounded media design decisions based on needs assessments; (c) design and produce media or prototypes of media; (d) plan implementations of media or prototypes in order to conduct formative evaluations of their effeciveness; and (e) use outcomes of formative evaluations to revise media or prototypes (iterative design).    Students will demonstrate knowledge of (a) learning theories widely used to inform the design of educational media, e.g., theories in the learning sciences, cognitive science theories of learning, developmental psychology theories of learning, social learning theories, and constructivist and constructionist theories of learning; (b) implications of such learning theories for media design principles and models; and (c) knowledge of how to use these learning theories, and the principles and models based on them, to make sound media design decisions.    Students will demonstrate technical skills required to produce media, including computer-based multimedia, web-based media, media for mobile tablets and phones, and video-based media.    Students will able to identify and critique major twentieth and twenty-first century historical developments, benchmarks, theoretical shifts, and broad trends in practice in the field of educational technology.    Students will be able to identify, and will have skills to access, sources of information and organizations for the purpose of keeping in the field of educational technology.

As monitors get larger so do their aspect ratios, the 960 pixel width offers University authors the ability to use more dynamic content and the site viewer more opportunity to view that content. It also changed our design and visual styles.     Design Foundations   The look of the NYU.edu reflects back on previous versions but looks forward to a more Web 2.0 design that is clean and free of too many flourishes, allowing the content to take the spotlight. After all NYU.edu would not exist if it were not for the content and work done at the university.   There was a process of a number of months to investigate the best design to meet all of the targeted needs and audiences. What has evolved is a strong foundation for the next chapter in NYU\u2019s online presence.        Color Palette   You're probably noticed that NYU's primary color is purple. It's a very specifc color of purple, to be exact. The specifics of &quot;NYU purple&quot; and the subsequent primary and secondary color pallettes is what you're going to see all throughout the NYU.edu site:         Official NYU Purple                               HEX: 57068c; CMYK: C85, M100, Y0, K0; RGB: R87, G6, B140           Primary Colors           Color Hex RGB   NYU Purple 57068c 87,6,140  Link Red d11255 209,18,85   Text Black 23241e 35, 36, 30        Secondary Colors           Color Hex RGB   Gray 818790 128, 135, 143  Blue 448ccb 69, 140, 204  Dark Cyan 005b7f 1, 91, 126  Green 0e7d8e 14, 125, 142  Cyan 0077a2 0, 119, 162  Brown 816c5d 130, 108, 94      Content Elements   Fonts   Gotham is the University's official font family and was created and is provided by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones .   The NYU.edu website uses Verdana as its main system font.   Headers   The NYU.edu site uses headers in logical hierarchy (ex: H2 is sub category of H1 and H3 is subcategory of H2 &amp; etc.). There is only one H1 per page as the page title. This H1 is as close to the convention of the page filename as possible to improve search engine optimization.   We have reserved H6 for accessibility (hidden/ off screen).                H1 HEADER         font-size: 37px   font-family: Gotham Book     H2 HEADER   font-size: 24px   font-family: Gotham Book   H3 HEADER   font-size: 19px   font-family: Gotham Medium   H4 HEADER   font-size: 13px   font-weight: bold   font-family: Verdana, Arial   H5 HEADER   font-size: 12px   font-family: Verdana, Arial                       Layout   Web pages always have a dominant element and a number of additional, peripheral elements. On content pages, the dominant element is always situated in the left top corner of a page. This is where the title and primary content is located. Everything else on the page is considered secondary to this main element, but secondary elements also have a hierarchy.   Separate Content: Defining what is &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;Secondary&quot;   The informational content on a Web site can have various content types: It can be displayed as text, images, videos, multimedia presentations, audio files, slideshows, or promotions. Within every content type, it is important to separate the \u201cmost important\u201d from the \u201cleast important\u201d \u2013 or in our terms, \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d content \u2013 and classify the hierarchy of importance of what we would like to communicate to the public (site viewer).   Considering the interactive character of the internet and the limited space on the screen, it is important to wisely determine your site\u2019s most important goals when choosing to publish the content.   Main text content can have other related content. For example: photo galleries or videos, interactive forms, or multimedia presentations. It is up to the author to determine what the most important, related content is and its hierarchy within the page.   Making choices is the key to successful layout. Some believe every topic is important and so it may be hard to make these choices. However, they do have to be made, particularly when one subject leads into another, or because it is easier to read from primary to secondary content then reading an undistinguished block of the same size content.           Photography   Photography used on the NYU.edu site must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website.   We recommend using the NYU Photo Bureau for University photography needs to help ensure that you have both the appropriate level of quality and the permission to use images on the University website.        Graphics   While the use of graphics on the NYU.edu website is limited, any graphics used must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website, and must follow guidelines provided in the University Identity and Style Guide .   We recommend using high-quality graphics created by designers rather than line or clip art.         Videos   We recommend that videos on the web are no longer than 2 minutes in length and don't require proprietary software for site viewers to watch. We also strongly recommend that all videos contain captions.     NYU.edu uses the JW Player by LongTail as its local video player.

The DMDL studio-based curriculum is complemented by an excellent internship program with host sites in all areas of educational technology and media.    Unlike programs that are focused on the application of existing technologies to formal schooling (such as how to use PowerPoint in teaching high school), our program is appropriate for people who wish to design the media and technology of the future for all kinds of learning environments, or who wish to conduct academic research on how people learn with technology.    Our alumni work in a variety of areas, including the ed tech and media industries, the education sector, government and policy, and research and development. Previously called Educational Communications and Technology, the program has a rich history dating back more than 60 years.    By selecting electives from a specified list of courses, students may optionally concentrate in Games for Learning within the DMDL degree. The concentration is notated on the transcript, and does not lengthen the degree.    The complete program description and requirements may be found in the DMDL Guide for the Master of Arts and Advanced Certificate Programs .    Program Goals and Mission    The project-based curriculum of Digital Media Design Learning prepares students to design rich technology-based, multimedia learning environments and to understand and evaluate their use in wide-ranging educational settings. The program exposes students to the design of computer-based, multimedia simulations and games for learning, dramatic and documentary narratives, media that support advocacy and advance social justice, the educational potential of social media, and educational applications of media and technology for international development. The program employs media design principles and theoretical perspectives drawn from the cognitive sciences, the learning sciences, developmental models of learning, constructivist and constructionist philosophies of learning, and social learning theories.    Student Learning Outcomes       Students will use the instructional design process to develop educational media for wide-ranging educational and training settings and diverse distribution platforms and channels: (a) conduct and document needs assessments; (b) make and document theoretically-grounded media design decisions based on needs assessments; (c) design and produce media or prototypes of media; (d) plan implementations of media or prototypes in order to conduct formative evaluations of their effeciveness; and (e) use outcomes of formative evaluations to revise media or prototypes (iterative design).    Students will demonstrate knowledge of (a) learning theories widely used to inform the design of educational media, e.g., theories in the learning sciences, cognitive science theories of learning, developmental psychology theories of learning, social learning theories, and constructivist and constructionist theories of learning; (b) implications of such learning theories for media design principles and models; and (c) knowledge of how to use these learning theories, and the principles and models based on them, to make sound media design decisions.    Students will demonstrate technical skills required to produce media, including computer-based multimedia, web-based media, media for mobile tablets and phones, and video-based media.    Students will able to identify and critique major twentieth and twenty-first century historical developments, benchmarks, theoretical shifts, and broad trends in practice in the field of educational technology.    Students will be able to identify, and will have skills to access, sources of information and organizations for the purpose of keeping in the field of educational technology.
