This program provides a creative approach to reach LGBTQ students of color by featuring program content that would potentially resonate with them. The series gives a platform for these students specifically, to know that their stories or stories similar to theirs are necessary for growth, appreciation, and important enough to be featured on our campus. This program also allows the larger campus community an opportunity to engage in oral story telling and performance, a tradition that has been historically shared by many communities of color as a means of passing down their histories not otherwise written about.   The Real Queer Film Series is a program that brings LGBTQ identified filmmakers to the forefront at our campus. We look to screen feature films that highlight LGBTQ identified actors, producers, directors whom have dedicated their lives to present issues and experiences related to LGBTQ life. This year we are proud to announce that we will have our first Real Queer Film Series screening event at NYU Poly!

The goal of the course is to familiarize students with lesbian and gay plays written since 1968 as a discrete body of work within the field of contemporary theatre. The course focuses on plays and playwrights that have had a significant impact in the representation of homosexual life onstage. In addition, students consider the historical, political, and cultural developments from which gay theatre emerged and, through independent research projects, examine the communities that emerged in the process of creating gay theatre.

This program provides a creative approach to reach LGBTQ students of color by featuring program content that would potentially resonate with them. The series gives a platform for these students specifically, to know that their stories or stories similar to theirs are necessary for growth, appreciation, and important enough to be featured on our campus. This program also allows the larger campus community an opportunity to engage in oral story telling and performance, a tradition that has been historically shared by many communities of color as a means of passing down their histories not otherwise written about.   The Real Queer Film Series is a program that brings LGBTQ identified filmmakers to the forefront at our campus. We look to screen feature films that highlight LGBTQ identified actors, producers, directors whom have dedicated their lives to present issues and experiences related to LGBTQ life. This year we are proud to announce that we will have our first Real Queer Film Series screening event at NYU Poly!

The goal of the course is to familiarize students with lesbian and gay plays written since 1968 as a discrete body of work within the field of contemporary theatre. The course focuses on plays and playwrights that have had a significant impact in the representation of homosexual life onstage. In addition, students consider the historical, political, and cultural developments from which gay theatre emerged and, through independent research projects, examine the communities that emerged in the process of creating gay theatre.
