Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors?

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.

Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine?

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.

What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.

There was humanitarian intervention already in the 19th century, undertaken by European states to protect Christians, mostly against the Ottoman Empire. However, it is only after the end of the Cold War that there have been serious challenges to existing legal and political notions of state sovereignty and war. Since then, intervention has come to be better known as the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), an emerging norm of war with a just cause. This class will take a case study approach to address the political, legal and ethical aspects of R2P. It  will discuss crucial questions, when and how is it just to intervene?; what are the outcomes of intervention or the lack of it? The goal is to portray problems and responsibilities of an array of state and non-state actors using the interesting and difficult humanitarian emergencies of Haiti,  Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, East Timor, Rwanda, Darfur and more recently Libya and Syria. While cases will enable students to experience interventions (or lack of intervention), through the behavior of actual participants, a survey of the main norm-setting documents will serve to establish a genealogy of R2P, as well as the political and intellectual arguments that lay out its justification and limits.    Back to Top         International Political Development    Asli Peker   For a long time, the questions that drove the debates and practices of development have focused on the economy, and more specifically on economic growth: Why are some nations rich and others poor? What could be done to put the poor nations on a path toward economic development? How could aid be utilized to stimulate growth? However, in the last couple of decades, there emerged an increasing recognition that development needs to be understood as more than economic growth, and a subsequent shift of focus to its social and political dimensions. Taking its cue from this shift, two realted themes run through the material to be covered in this course: the relationship between politics and economic development and the dynamics of political development. After a critical assessment of the discourse and history of development, we will discuss topics such as the role of the state in economy, strong versus weak and failed states and state-building efforts, the effect of political institutions and legal frameworks in determining policy choices and driving economic growth, the relationship between democracy and development, dynamics of democratic transitions and democracy promotion, the civil society, political accountability, transparency and the anti-corruption agenda, and the debates around good governance.    Back to Top         Arab-Israeli Conflict    Charles Freilich   The Arab-Israeli conflict has been at the center of regional and international attention for some eight decades, defying repeated attempts at resolution, both military and diplomatic. The course provides an in-depth survey of the historical evolution of the conflict and substance of the various peace negotiations to date, including the reasons for their failure, as a basis for understanding the parties' positions and the central issues dividing them today. This survey then serves as the basis for the primary focus of the course, the potential means of resolving the conflict. Most of the course will be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, part to Israel and Syria and Lebanon. The issues will be presented in the national security and domestic political contexts of each of the different players.    As a contemporary policy oriented course, students will assume the role of senior decision makers from the different parties and draft \u201cpolicy papers\u201d to their heads of state, elucidating the various issues and recommending means of resolving them. In addition to learning the complexities of the issues, students will also deal with the challenging process of drafting real-world policy papers and recommendations. The course is designed for those with a general interest in the Middle East, especially those interested in national security issues, strategy and decision making, students of comparative politics and future practitioners.    Back to Top         MidEast National Security    Charles Freilich   At the crossroads of three continents, the Middle East is home to many diverse peoples, with ancient and proud cultures, in varying stages of political and socio-economic development, often times in conflict. Now in a state of historic flux, the Arab Spring and subsequent upheaval, including the rise of ISIS, have transformed the Middle Eastern landscape, with great consequence for the national security strategies of the countries of the region and the international community.    The course surveys the national security challenges facing the region's primary players today (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinians and Turkey) and how the convolutions of recent years have affected them. Unlike many Middle East courses, which focus on US policy in the region, the course concentrates on the regional players' perceptions of the threats and opportunities they face and on the strategies they have adopted to deal with them.    As a contemporary policy oriented course, students will assume the role of senior decision makers from the different countries and draft \u201cpolicy papers\u201d to their heads of state, elucidating the various issues and recommending means of resolving them. In addition to learning the complexities of the issues, students will also deal with the challenging process of drafting real-world policy papers and recommendations.The course is designed for those with a general interest in the Middle East, especially those interested in national security issues, students of comparative politics and future practitioners.    Back to Top         US National Security    Joe Helman   Enrollment limited to students in IR and Politics MA programs.   This course examines conceptual and theoretical foundations, organizational structures and functions, decision making processes, and priority issues in US national security. The process of policy making is examined to include: the role and authorities of the President, National Security Council, and the Executive Branch; congressional oversight; and policy development and implementation. The course also examines the tools, uses, and limits of national power. Strategic and conventional defense capabilities and policy are examined, as are the roles and missions of intelligence. High priority national security challenges such as terrorism, proliferation, and cyber security are also addressed. The course is conducted as an interactive graduate seminar.    Back to Top         Public Diplomacy    Kara Alaimo   At a time when the U.S. and other states are hesitant to engage in military action but face pressing global challenges, this course will examine how countries can effectively deploy \u201csoft power\u201d in order to achieve international goals. A critical class for students considering careers in their government\u2019s foreign service or in international organizations, we study how states and organizations can most effectively build relationships with foreign publics in order to win \u201chearts and minds.\u201d The class explores how governments attempt to inform, persuade, and engage foreign publics in order to achieve their national objectives. We study how public diplomacy is practiced today by nations such as the U.S. and China and examine recent developments, including how governments and other actors are harnessing new communication technology; how foreign audiences are responding to government messages and influencing government behavior; and how public diplomacy is practiced in the current global war on terror. Students will learn how to craft strategic, sophisticated, forward-thinking public diplomacy strategies that effectively influence global public opinion. At the end of the course, students will be prepared to cultivate and maintain productive relationships between foreign audiences and governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations, based upon genuine, mutual understanding and two-way communication.    Back to Top         Regime Change & International Security    Linda Kirschke   This course examines the relationship between regime change, regime type and problems in international relations.    First, the course presents social science literature on democratization and the risk of war. It examines the role of civil society groups and transitional and international courts in mitigating conflict during periods of regime change. The course covers the political transitions in the Middle East and post-Communist Europe and Eurasia and analyzes variation across these cases.    Second, the course considers literature on authoritarian regimes and investigates what variables drive some authoritarian regimes to develop into \u201crogue states\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis foreign powers. It addresses how the application of international sanctions impacts authoritarian regimes.    Third, the course examines how intervention by international and regional organizations affects prospects for political change. It analyzes issues surrounding international democracy promotion programs in conflict and post-conflict settings.    Back to Top         Governance in New Democracies    Mark Schneider   Why do many democracies established since World War II suffer from weak accountability and poor governance? Through lectures and discussion, this course provides an introduction to fundamental challenges that developing democracies face. These include: poverty, party institutionalization, state capacity, corruption, political manipulation of public policies, and ethnic conflict. We also discuss the positive effects that increased competition and information can have in some of these areas. Course readings and lectures cover a range of scholarly approaches and draw upon cases from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.    Back to Top         Natural Resource Conflicts    Muserref Yetim   Since the mid-1980s, natural resource conflicts have become the focus of scholarly debate as the broadening concept of security has begun to include issues such as environmental change, natural resource abundance, degradation, and depletion, and their impact on international order and stability. Contemporary resource problems, rooted in the overuse and mismanagement of these resources and the subsequent degradation of ecosystems, often do not respect state boundaries and so present challenges that are local, international, and in some cases even global in nature. This course is divided into five parts. In Part I, we will review the literature on the relationship between natural resources, security and environmental, domestic, international, and global conflicts. Part II concentrates on the resource curse and the relationship between natural resources and economic and political development. In Part III, the focus is wars and it concentrates on how non-renewable natural resources, such as oil, strategic minerals, and gems, are facilitators or causes of conflict within and between states. Detailed attention will be given to the international politics of oil. In Part IV, the focus shifts to renewable resources and more specifically to water. Finally, in Part V, the focus is on developing institutional frameworks for governing cprs, and on the collective action and bargaining problems challenging states in doing so. Some of the interesting questions we\u2019ll address are: Are countries with abundant resources cursed? Is the price of oil inversely correlated with the spread of political freedom? Could Nigeria, other oil rich countries, have followed the same development trajectory as Denmark if they had not discovered oil? Do high commodity prices undermine democracy in oil and mineral rich countries (Russia)? What is the nature of relationship between oil and minerals and civil wars & low intensity conflicts? How does resource security fuel tension between the great powers? How did water become a source of contentious politics? What role does the NGO, WTO, and other IOs play in resolving resource conflicts?     Back to Top         Political Economy of Institutions    Muserref Yetim   This course is designed to introduce graduate students to the newly emerging field of the political economy of institutions. The focus will be on institutions, their origins, evolution, purpose, and tendencies to change or stabilize. Institutions are fundamentally important for determining how both exogenous and endogenous challenges affect policy changes at both the domestic and international levels. They thus hold the key to our understanding of the conditions shaping the choices of individuals, groups, and societies and the variations in their political capacities and interests. Institutions can be formal or informal, implicit or explicit in all economic and political models. The scope of our study will go beyond the effect of institutions and the implications of different forms of institutions to explain why and how institutions are structured in certain ways and why some institutions survive and others don\u2019t.   The course is divided into four parts. Part I provides an overview of definitional, conceptual, theoretical issues and an introduction to the origin and role of institutions in society. Part II will focus on the role of economic and politic institutions in long-term economic growth. Part III moves the debate to the role of institutions in the exploitation of natural resources and introduces various property regimes. In Part IV, the role institutions in providing order and stability and alleviating coordination, commitment, and principle-agent problems will be the main focus of inquiry. In this part, we will also explore the issues of corruption, moral hazard, and self-enforcing constitutions/democracies.    Back to Top         International Security    Patricia DeGennaro   This class introduces M.A. students to key concepts and approaches in the security studies subfield. The course has three main purposes: (1) to familiarize students with key debates in the security studies subfield; (2) to help students evaluate dilemmas of current security environment (3) to help students understand and critically analyze the complexity and factors for today\u2019s policy challenges for formulation and implementation.    The class is designed to answer the following questions: What are security challenges of today the future? What are the root causes of war and beliefs for intervention? What are alternatives to war? How can wars be prevented or at least limited? What can third parties do to help manage or limit wars? In answering these questions, the class will examine a number of important issues including complex military and diplomatic interventions and issues relating to regional conflict, insurgency, counterinsurgency, terrorism, piracy and other militant challanges.    The class will be run as a seminar. Doing the reading is not enough; students must be prepared to discuss it. There will usually be discussion questions distributed in class; if not, students should at minimum be prepared to summarize the key points of the readings.    Back to Top         UN Peacekeeping & Peacebuilding    Patty Chang   This course examines United Nations \u201ccomplex\u201d peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations since the end of the Cold War. It starts with an introduction to fundamentals: theories on the nature of conflict and types of peace operations. The course then explores a survey of the major UN missions, focusing on the international legal basis for intervention by external actors, states interest, capacity, mandate, strategies, and obstacles faced. It covers a number of cross-cutting issues including the politics of peacekeeping and peacebuilding, the relationship between peacebuilding and statebuilding, normative debates on justice and ethics, the debates and controversies on the promotion of democracy and market economics as a basis for peace, the challenges of evaluating outcomes, targeting the needs of recipient communities, as well as subcontracting peace, indigenous peacebuilding, and cooperation and coordination with multiple actors (notably non-governmental organizations, regional organizations, donor governments, and multinational coalitions). Overall, the course is designed to help students think analytically and systematically about peacekeeping and peacebuilding, along with providing them with a strong foundation of the enduring theoretical and policy debates and recent developments in field-based knowledge.    Back to Top         Diplomacy in Theory & Action    Robert Dry   Diplomacy has been called 'the engine of international relations'. A foreign policy can succeed or fail depending on the quality of a country's diplomacy. Yet, non-diplomats often misunderstand the role and power of diplomacy. That is unfortunate because diplomacy is a primary instrument of national power and in many contexts can be much more effective than the application of coercion. This course provides students with an understanding of the institution of diplomacy - where it comes from; how it functions; and how it is evolving. Some scholars equate negotiation with diplomacy and while it is the case that diplomats continually engage in negotiations of one form or another, this course is not intended to serve as a stand-alone course on negotiation. Nor is it a course on diplomatic history. Students who work hard on the required readings, short papers, and presentations will not only learn what diplomats do, but students should also be prepared to undertake service as a national diplomat or an international civil servant. As a matter of fact, the skills emphasized in this seminar will further students' understanding of international relations and advance skills needed in almost any international career.    Back to Top         Terrorism & Counterterrorism    Stuart Gottlieb   This course examines the origins and evolution of modern terrorism, challenges posed by terrorist groups to states and to the international system, and strategies employed to confront and combat terrorism. We assess a wide variety of terrorist organizations, and explore the psychological, socioeconomic, political, and religious causes of terrorist violence past and present. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various counterterrorism strategies, from the point of view of efficacy as well as ethics, and look into ways in which the new threat of global terrorism might impact the healthy functioning of democratic states.    Back to Top         Practicing Diplomacy    Damian Leader   This course will examine how U.S. strategic policy goals are translated into diplomatic action, focusing on the practical challenges of bilateral and multilateral advocacy and negotiation. The class will consider post-Cold War cases, including: how consensus was built domestically and internationally in support of NATO enlargement; reaction to recent crises in Georgia and Ukraine; African conflict resolution (including working with and through NGOs, corporations and other non-state actors); conventional and nuclear arms control; the post-9/11 use of diplomats in war zones; and how changing U.S. cultural values have influenced U.S. diplomacy on issues such as human rights, population control, and trafficking. Primacy will be given to how diplomats actually work, including how new technology has affected practice in the field.    Back to Top         Political Economy of International Trade    Akram Esanov   The main objective of this course is to examine the impact of political and economic factors on international trade policy. This course addresses leading theories and major policy debates in political economy of international trade. In particular, this course examines key models in the economics of international trade, the rationale behind trade liberalization and protection, the distributional consequences of trade, the role of interest groups, domestic and international institutions in trade policy making. In addition, the course aims to equip graduate students with analytical tools to pursue empirical research on a pertinent issue.   The course is divided into several sections. We will begin by surveying main theoretical frameworks in international trade, including the new trade theory. Next, we will scrutinize the political economy theories to explain trade protection and trade liberalization. We will proceed with the analysis of international trade regimes and their effect on trade policy reforms in both developing and developed countries. We will also analyze the relationship between international trade, democratic transition and economic development. The course will conclude with the discussion of contemporary debates in political economy of international trade.    Back to Top         Contemporary U.S.-China Relations    James Nolt   China and the U.S. are the two most influential countries in the world today, so their relationship is crucial to the future of both the world economy and global peace and security. This course will begin with a review of political economy (not presuming students have a strong background in economics or political economy) and then consider the U.S.-China relationship in its economic, political, and security dimensions.    Back to Top         Nationalism    Shinasi Rama   Nationalism was a common cause of conflict in international politics of past two centuries. Yet, the intensification and the vengeful resurgence of nationalist conflicts in the post- Cold War era have been most unexpected and surprising for policy-makers and scholars alike. The increasing frequency and deadliness of nationalist conflict at the international and the intra- state level, from mass expulsions to state-sponsored genocide, has prompted international and humanitarian interventions that have challenged time-honored norms of state behavior and its integrity. However, despite widespread recognition amongst intellectuals and policymakers of the virulent resurgence of nationalism, there is a widespread lack of consensus on the meaning and origins of, as well as the management strategies for dealing with, nationalist conflict. To many, nationalism appears just an amorphous and protean form of organization that is difficult to be defined, described and controlled.   Most of the literature for this course will be drawn from the contemporary debates on nation and international relations theory and practice, intentionally fusing together theory and case studies. However, while emphasis will be placed on achieving a better understanding of theoretical interpretations and frameworks for action, we will take good care to examine a number of case studies in a variety of contexts. This will familiarize us with the repertoire of strategies, justifications, and practices used by all actors. We will do so through assigned readings, but also by following events and conflict that unfold during this semester.    Back to Top         The United States in the World: Power/Institutions/Leadership    John Fousek   This course examines the history of US foreign policy, at home and abroad, in global context. Themes include: the long-term ascendancy of the US as a world power; domestic sources of US power; the development of state apparatus and other institutions concerned with foreign policy and national security; the role of individual leaders; the uses of American power, including the military force, cultural influence and shaping international institutions; and the global and domestic consequences of US foreign policy.    Back to Top         American Foreign Policy    Stuart M Gottlieb   This course examines the sources, substance, and enduring themes of American foreign policy. Part I reviews the rise of American power in world affairs from the 18th Century through the end of the Cold War. Part II provides an overview of the process and politics of American foreign policy making. Part III applies the theory and history of Part I, and the process of Part II, to examine a number of contemporary U.S. foreign policy issues and debates, including America\u2019s two wars with Iraq; America\u2019s responses to the threat of global terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and what role the United States should play in the world economy, global and regional institutions, and the developing world.    Back to Top         Ideology & Propaganda    Grid Rroji   What is ideology? How does propaganda work? Is propaganda at the service of ideology or ideology at the service of propaganda? Are the mass media inevitably the vehicle for the propagation of ideologies? This course proposes to discuss these questions by drawing on political philosophy and history to analyze three fundamental concepts and the ways in which they are connected: ideology, propaganda and communication. It is divided in three parts. The first four sessions focus on the definition of ideology: genealogy, Marxist and neo-Marxist conceptions and study of related concepts. In sessions 5 to 9, we will examine the link between ideology and propaganda and we will study propaganda techniques as used during the 20th century wars. The last part will be dedicated to the analysis of recent controversial questions and critical approaches to media productions and consumption: the end of ideology debate, the phenomenon of public diplomacy, the evolution of anti-Americanism.     Back to Top         Global Finance: Political, Economic, & Managerial Perspectives    Giuseppe Ammendola   This course looks at international finance and its crucial connections with international business practices and with the policy challenges of economic globalization and interdependence.   The course examines the roles that governments and international institutions play in the global financial integration process both in terms of regulation and supervision. We shall also look at the impact on global financial markets by a plurality of participants---central banks and treasuries; financial intermediaries and foreign exchange dealers, both bank and non-bank; individuals and firms engaged in commercial and investment activities; and speculators and arbitrageurs. The emphasis will be on the identification of key ideas, theories, techniques, and strategies underlying the behavior of all players.   Through lectures, in-class training, discussions, and the examination of case studies, students will deepen their understanding of some of the most powerful actors and forces in the world economy and the current debates concerning them. More broadly, the course draws lessons from political science, economics, business, law, history, sociology and psychology in order to understand the multiple challenges faced by decision makers not just in the private but also in the public and nonprofit sectors. Overall the teaching is informed by the sharing with the students of insights derived from multiple disciplines, cultures, and languages to help them gain valuable real-world skills.    Back to Top         Political Opinion Writing    Maha Hosain Aziz   Whether you end up in government, an NGO, a policy think tank or some other job related to politics and international affairs, it is probable that you will write an opinion piece in the media at some point on your area of expertise. This course is for those of you in the MA Program who want to develop political opinion research and writing skills and develop more nuanced opinions that reflect your advanced degrees in politics and international relations.   Initially, we will focus on political opinion writing in different media, taking a critical view of the content and writing style of published writers (including Dr Aziz\u2019s work). We will briefly consider academic literature about writing techniques as well the ability of the media to produce unbiased opinion and even influence policy. There will then be lectures on different topics in politics and discussion on related political science readings. You will produce opinion pieces in reaction to these lectures and readings, using academic literature, media, policy reports and other sources to help shape your argument. The goal will be for you to create well-researched, structured and highly original political opinion pieces that go beyond the obvious and are published. Students who outperform may have the opportunity to co-write a piece on Dr Aziz\u2019s Huffington Post WorldPost blog.   Past students have published pieces on varied topics including ethnic tensions in France, the plight of the Italian Roma minority, the legacy of Rwanda\u2019s genocide, Bahrain\u2019s sectarian violence and Afghan women\u2019s rights in the Huffington Post, Democrat and Chronicle, Sharnoff\u2019s Global Views, World Policy Journal, European Magazine, Global Politics Magazine and Worldpress.org .        Back to Top         Transitional Justice    Arnaud Kurze   The objective of this graduate level course is to introduce students to the critical study of transitional justice and post\u00adconflict accountability. Transitional justice is a relatively new concept in international studies that was coined in the wake of transitions from authoritarian rule in the Southern Cone of Latin America; the demise of the Soviet bloc in Central Europe; and atrocious civil wars and ethnic conflicts across the African and Asian continent to capture the efforts of newly democratizing countries, to grapple with the legacy of grave human rights violations committed during previous authoritarian rule and, in the context of internal armed conflicts. The transitional justice mechanisms countries adopted in the wake of mass atrocity have included truth commissions to investigate past atrocities; criminal trials against those responsible for grave human rights abuses; vetting and purges of state officials connected to authoritarian rule and/or rights violations; and reparations programs. The concept of transitional justice quickly gained relevance beyond the described regions and has since developed into a rich and multifaceted field of interdisciplinary research and praxis, although it is not without detractors. The course will introduce students to the theoretical debates within the field of transitional justice, examine several case studies, and critically analyze the actors engaged in the field.     Back to Top         Intellectual Origins of IR Theories    Mehmet Tabak   What are the grounds for the academic claims that we live in an essentially anarchic world in which the primary actors are rational agents, and that these agents are ultimately motivated by self-preservation and/or self-interest? Why do some intellectuals more optimistically believe in the possibility of mutual recognition, cooperation, and benefit? Why do others insist that both domestic and international relations are hierarchical, exploitative, and imperialistic? In short, how do various intellectual traditions explain the motivations that guide individuals and organized communities to participate in political and economic activities? Relatedly, how do they understand political power, and its relationship to economy Intellectuals of all stripes have been pondering these and other similar questions for centuries. In our times, their insights have crystalized into various theories of international relations, such as realism(s), liberalism(s), and Marxism(s). If so, the contemporary IR theories owe much intellectual debt to their predecessors. Proceeding from this premise, \u201cIntellectual Origins of IR Theories\u201d simultaneously examines the profound insights of the earlier intellectuals, and links these insights to their contemporary variants. The main purpose of this critical examination is to help students gain a more profound appreciation of these theories. Such an appreciation is also a promising step toward an improved understanding of the real world in which we live. In order to successfully attain its aims, this course encourages attentive reading, informed and spirited discussion, and engaged written-responses.     Back to Top         NGOs & Global Politics    Christine Wing   This course explores how NGOs and social movements can and do affect global political dynamics. We will pursue this topic primarily through case studies in four substantive areas: human rights; apartheid in South Africa; the international arms trade; and the end of the Cold War. In the first three weeks of the course, we will attempt to develop (1) working definitions of \u201cNGOs,\u201d \u201csocial movements,\u201d and \u201cglobal politics;\u201d (2) an understanding of how NGOs and social movements have emerged and how they have evolved; and (3) initial ideas about the challenges facing NGOs and social movements as their work engages global political dynamics and interests. The next eight weeks will be devoted to case studies. We will spend two weeks on each of the topics noted above. We will learn about the substantive issue and the NGOs/movements that work on that issue; analyze the mechanisms through which these NGOs/movements are functioning in the international arena; and evaluate the effectiveness of their work. In the final three classes, we will take what we have learned and use it to analyze another area of NGO and movement activism\u2014environmental change. We will also hear students\u2019 presentations of their research project. Readings\u2014both theoretical and case studies\u2014will draw on a range of literature, including political science, historical analysis, and the study of organizational behavior. Students will write short papers on the readings, and develop a sample plan for organizing an NGO whose work has effects at the global level. A final research paper will also be required. For questions, please contact the instructor at chris.wing@nyu.edu .     Back to Top         Middle East Politics    Asli Peker   This course is a graduate level introduction to politics in the contemporary Middle East. It does not require substantial background in Middle Eastern studies, but basic familiarity with contemporary history and politics of the region is assumed. The course\u2019s primary concern is to contextualize the study of the Middle East in a historical and comparative framework. The course starts with a brief overview of modern history of the region and a discussion of what the political construct \u201cMiddle East\u201d entails, how it came about and why we should be studying it. From there on, we move to weekly topical readings and discussions. Among the topics examined are: Great Powers' interests and encroachments into the region, the modernizing reforms and the processes of state formation; post-independence developments including coups, revolutions and wars; the evolution of political Islam and nationalism as rival ideologies; the peculiarities of the Islamic state; the persistent Arab-Israeli conflict and other hot conflicts in the region; politics of gender, oil and the rentier state; civil society and contentious politics; dynamics of authoritarianism and democratization; the political potential and impact of new media; and more recent developments in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. Readings and examples are drawn from a selected subset of Middle Eastern countries, no one country is studied individually in depth, but rather used in a comparative framework to underline historical patterns, similarities and differences. The course is designed as a seminar. Students are expected to do a number of presentations and participate substantially in the class discussions.     Back to Top         Minority Rights    Bonnie Brennan        The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the historical problem of minorities and its contemporary implications. The presence of an ethnic, linguistic or religious minority within the borders of a state obviously has ramifications for nation-building, economic development and the domestic peace. When, however, a violent ethnic conflict involving a minority, particularly a minority related to a kin-state, arises, the conflict can also destabilize an entire region of the world. This course will examine both the domestic and international dimensions of the problem.    Back to Top           US Foreign Policy - History, Ideas & Cases    Michael John Williams   Foreign Policy is the way in which a state \u2013 the primary unit for organizing world politics \u2013 interacts with the world around it. Foreign policy encompasses the establishment of alliances, the pursuit of trade objectives, the creation of military doctrine, international negotiations and the waging of war. Foreign Policy is about relations between states, but it is influenced by the domestic politics and culture of the state.    This course focuses on the foreign policy of the United States of America. There are a number of ways to study foreign policy \u2013 theoretical, practical, historical, and ideological are but a few of the most popular methods. This course utilizes a synthesis of differing approaches. The course offers a strong grounding in the history of USFP from the founding of the Republic to the present day, with a particular focus on \u2018ideas\u2019 about America\u2019s role in the world. The course also examines a number of thematic issues confronting the US in the world today, before moving on to look at some specific contemporary challenges facing US policy-makers.  The reading list for this course is extensive, and the course is designed to be one of the most comprehensive of any such course in the world. You will be expected to work diligently to accomplish the course aims.    This course provides third-year undergraduate students with a highly advanced knowledge of the key concepts, history, themes and contemporary issues in US Foreign Policy. This course will familiarize students with theoretical explanations of US foreign policy, historical and contemporary American thinking on international affairs, the structure of foreign policy making in Washington DC, as well as some of the major challenges facing contemporary American policy-makers.    Back to Top         Ethics of Contemporary Conflicts    Anna Di Lellio   The laws of war that regulate conduct during conflict belong to customary international law, and the wide agreement that they enjoy is based on shared belief in their underlying norms. Or not? In modern wars, both patterns of organized violence and the reaction to them have changed. Practices have emerged that are evolving into new norms, providing ample opportunities for challenging the current foundations of morality and potentially the law.   For example, the global \u201cwar on terror\u201d argues for exceptional responses to existential threats, reevaluating the normally accepted notion of the equality of combatants; new technologies intended to protect lives, such as drones, redefine standards of proportionality; asymmetric wars, often intra-state, question traditional understandings of noncombatant immunity; and humanitarian interventions challenge definitions of legality and/or legitimacy of aggression.   The focus of this course is to provide an understanding of the gap between laws, norms and practices of war, beyond the classic argument of realism - - i.e. interest and power always trump ethics \u2013 and beyond a static understanding of the rules of conduct in wars. It addresses the dynamic role of norms as interests, and norm entrepreneurs such as states and non\u2013state actors, through a mix of theoretical discussions and case-studies.         War and Peace    Amy Catalinac   How do actors and institutions influence states' decisions for war or peace? Which actors and institutions matter more, those located at the domestic or international level? This course aims to familiarize students with the major paradigms in international relations and the actors and institutions highlighted in those paradigms as being particularly consequential for states' security policies. Sessions will be comprised of student-led presentations that summarize the material we have read and generate discussion of the research designs, findings, and methodologies employed therein, as well as their application to contemporary security policy challenges. The course aims to equip students with the necessary tools to conduct research on foreign security policy, complete a final research paper, and deliver a presentation to the class summarizing their findings.                Immigration and Transnationalism           Roy Germano               Global migration flows have reached unprecedented levels. Immigrants now account for one out of every eight people living in the United States\u2014the largest share in almost a century. Many rural communities in countries like Mexico, on the other hand, have been all but deserted by young adults, with those who remain behind supported by the increasingly massive sums of money that migrants send home. What is driving trends like these, and what are their political and economic implications? Why do people migrate? To what extent can the United States control immigration? How do U.S. immigration policy and anti-immigrant sentiment affect immigrant integration and inclusion in American society? How does any number of policies affect immigrant families and children? What is the relationship between emigration, transnationalism, and human development in poor countries?                             Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
