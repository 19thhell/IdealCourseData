Coursework will consist of weekly assignments \u2013 usually in the form of primary and secondary readings to be recited and discussed in common. A term paper on a topic of individual interest will also be required.    Introduction to Classical Chinese EAST-UA 226 Prerequisites: EAST-UA 206 or permission of the instructor.
