Around the world, people confront the relationship between the two by seeking to democratize the green city\u2014some from above, some from below. Everywhere, they face massive obstacles. In this third and final session, we ask how top-down, government projects can be paired with grassroots organizing to democratize the green city. What transnational financial and governance circuits restrict democratic policy formation and implementation and grassroots influence? How can progressive politicians create their own networks to provide a democratic counterweight to these more coercive circuits? How can grassroots activists trust and work with politicians in this context? And how well do successful projects\u2019 models transfer to new cities? We examine tensions common across cities of the global North and South\u2014in particular, those between coercive transnational institutions and local democratic structures, and between progressive governmental projects and grassroots action. Greening cities means more than environmental remediation and ecological enhancements. To be socially sustainable they will also require a renewal of urban democracy.   --------------------------------   Sapana Doshi is Assistant Professor at the School of Geography and Development at the University of Arizona.

How can we distinguish between genuine ecological enhancements and mere green marketing? To what extent have greening efforts in New York and other cities in the North and South served first and foremost as \u201cluxury ecologies\u201d, which improve the local environment at the cost of social displacement? What potential is there for urban greening to be anchored to social justice projects? And in the context of global city development strategies, how much can grassroots struggles for ecological services like essential water and sanitation infrastructure achieve? We seek to investigate these questions by exploring the link between ecological enhancement and social displacement across North and South, from Mumbai to New York, probing municipal policymakers\u2019 and grassroots activists\u2019 challenges and opportunities.              ------------------------------------   Invited Speakers:   Julian Brash , Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Monclair State University, is the author of the acclaimed Bloomberg\u2019s New York: Class and Governance in the Luxury City (2011). His current research focuses on the High Line and other new public parks in New York City.   Nikhil Anand , Assistant Professor of Geography, Environment and Society at the University of Minnesota, has written extensively in geography and anthropology on the political ecology of urban infrastructures and their social and material relations, with a focus on Mumbai.     Miriam Greenberg , Associate Professor of Sociology and Director of the Urban Studies Research Cluster at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is the author of Branding New York: How a City in Crisis was Sold to the World (2009) and the forthcoming Crisis Cities: Disaster and Redevelopment in New York and New Orleans (with Kevin Fox Gotham). Her current research addresses the varying discourses and practices of \u201curban sustainability,\u201d with a particular focus on California city-regions.     Following the speakers\u2019 opening remarks and a brief round of responses, the audience will join in a discussion moderated by Hillary Angelo , a PhD candidate in Sociology at NYU who has written extensively on urban political ecology, and whose dissertation tracks a century of urban greening in Germany\u2019s Ruhr region.

Around the world, people confront the relationship between the two by seeking to democratize the green city\u2014some from above, some from below. Everywhere, they face massive obstacles. In this third and final session, we ask how top-down, government projects can be paired with grassroots organizing to democratize the green city. What transnational financial and governance circuits restrict democratic policy formation and implementation and grassroots influence? How can progressive politicians create their own networks to provide a democratic counterweight to these more coercive circuits? How can grassroots activists trust and work with politicians in this context? And how well do successful projects\u2019 models transfer to new cities? We examine tensions common across cities of the global North and South\u2014in particular, those between coercive transnational institutions and local democratic structures, and between progressive governmental projects and grassroots action. Greening cities means more than environmental remediation and ecological enhancements. To be socially sustainable they will also require a renewal of urban democracy.   --------------------------------   Sapana Doshi is Assistant Professor at the School of Geography and Development at the University of Arizona.

But zoom in on any given project and over and over the same problem presents itself: too often green progress reinforces social inequality. Greening an area\u2014either by reducing pollution or increasing livability\u2014raises a place\u2019s economic value; those who cannot afford to stay find themselves forced out. Is it possible to break this link between environmental improvement and social displacement? Life in cities cannot continue without it, but democracy in cities cannot survive the increasing polarization of inequality\u2014sometimes called eco-apartheid\u2014that this tendency is likely to produce.    Our spring discussion series seeks to deepen our understanding of the causes of\u2014and potential solutions to\u2014this problem. What are the social politics surrounding discourses of sustainability and how can they be made more democratic? The complex nature of the issue and its impact necessitates a broad, interdisciplinary conversation; by bringing together scholars and practitioners across the social sciences, humanities, and design disciplines, we aim to inject social justice into the discussion on green cities through critical, engaged debate, asking how cities can be made more green while critically interrogating the discussion itself.
