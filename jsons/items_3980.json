The  emphasis of the course is on practical application and the development of sound  instruction skills, with attention to empirical justification for  methodological choices drawn from research. The course is designed to acquaint  the student with a broad range of background skills, activity formats and media  that can be used to enhance the proficiency-oriented teaching/learning  experience at the university level. The seminar format requires that all  students contribute to classroom discussions. Outside reading is therefore  criticalto successful performance in the course.      This  is a zero credit, Pass/Fail course. All PhD and MFA students teaching in the  language program for the first time are required to enroll.            SPAN-GA 2965.001      Title: Seminar in  Theory: Sense-Making   Instructor: Gabriela Basterra   Day/Time: Tuesday, 2-4pm   Description:      Narrative  creates the illusion of coherence and unity by arranging experience as  meaningful action in time through the invention of a work of synthesis, the  plot. This seminar studies the ways in  which contemporary narratives help us to make sense of the world and imagine a  significance for ourselves. By relating us to a beginning and to an end,  narrative is said to provide a sense of place, time and finality that  contributes to creating the illusion of belonging in the world. To narrate the past is, as Paul Ricoeur  remarks, to recollect a horizon of possibilities that gives impulse and  significance to our projections into the future. But the promise of action that narrative  contains is not always easy to discern.    If, for example, events are selected and arranged from the viewpoint of  the character\u2019s death, obliterating duration and process, those events may only  become intelligible in light of a predetermining fate. What happens, for example, when modern  narratives of subjectivity ultimately kill the lived experience they seek to  organize by requiring the self to identify with universals? How do particular modes of emplotment  fruitfully work towards creating the \u201cnecessary fictions\u201d that constitute us as  subjects?        Other  questions: what is the relation between narrative and referent, identity,  history, memory, intelligibility, time?    Do narrative roads not taken constitute historical possibilities left  uninvented, unexplored? Would the human  capacity for action be enlarged by the ability to envision \u201cvirtual histories\u201d  and imagine the \u201cwhat if\u2026?\u201d When  narrative closure is postponed or suspended, is sense suspended, too? Why are narratives of failure so  seductive? What happens when a  particular experience becomes unavailable to language? How does a trauma acquire the status of cause  in psychoanalytic narrations? How do we  confront narratives that frustrate our expectations or that resist  interpretation altogether, placing themselves beyond our reach? At the forefront of our inquiry will be the  role negation plays in creating objects for thought.

In this seminar, we will look at mass culture as a  multi-dimensional sphere in which objects, papers, spaces and screens displayed  the growing array of ideas and images that were produced, purchased, and  exchanged. Rather than think hierarchically about the divisions between  producers/consumers, factory/salon, \u00e9lite/masse, we will try to push into the  contact/clash zones that brought the struggles around economic modernity into  dialogue with the spectacles, pleasures, and fantasies of mass culture.  Although the political dimension of mass culture (especially as it relates to  techniques of display and distribution) is important to the work we will be  doing over the semester, the purpose of this seminar will be to focus on  commerce itself as a category in the work of avant-garde writers, artists, and  film makers. We will be working across an international bibliography of  theoretical texts and examples of artists and writers who either participated  directly in the creation of mass cultural artifacts or were avid  consumers/commentators of them.      Students  should contact Professor Mendelson with questions in advance of enrolling in  the seminar. Students will be expected to take on a heavy load of reading and  research and produce, by the end of the semester a finished piece of written  scholarship, which may be a state-of-the field paper and bibliography or an  original piece of writing based on archival/museum research. For those students  in MFA programs, who are interested in enrolling, they are welcome but should  think ahead about the kind of project they will need to complete by the end of  the term.      Incompletes  will not be granted, except in the case of a medial or family emergency.            SPAN-GA 2967.001            Title: Macuna\u00edma: Mito y Literatura      Instructor : Eduardo Subirats      Day/Time : Monday, 6-8pm            Description : Este seminario es la continuaci\u00f3n de una serie, comenzada en 2005, que  ha estado dedicada monogr\u00e1ficamente a la reconstrucci\u00f3n exhaustiva de novelas  can\u00f3nicas latinoamericanas desde una perspectiva mito-po\u00e9tica y \u201crom\u00e1ntica.\u201d  Hemos trabajado en este sentido a Pedro  P\u00e1ramo , Yo, El Supremo y Los r\u00edos profundos . Y seguire con Grande Sert\u00e3o de Guimar\u00e3es Rosa. Les  recuerdo algunos de los t\u00f3picos dominantes en estos seminarios: las diosas  precoloniales en la novela de Rulfo, la cr\u00edtica de la gramatologia derridiana  en Rama y Roa Bastos, el concepto de mimesis sagrada en la micropo\u00e9tica de  Arguedas. Como en sus versiones anteriores, este seminario sobre la novela de  M\u00e1rio de Andrade expondr\u00e1 sus momentos est\u00e9ticos, sociales y filos\u00f3ficos.  Cuatro son los puntos focales de este seminario: 1) las cosmolog\u00edas ind\u00edgenas;  2) el trickster y el clown en las tradiciones amerindias; e) el estudio cl\u00e1sico  sobre el trickster y su relaci\u00f3n con Hermes de Carl Ker\u00e9nyi, y el desarrollo  humanista de este t\u00f3pico en Thomas Mann; y c) el concepto filos\u00f3fico de  metamorfosis a partir de las cosmolog\u00edas amaz\u00f3nicas con un discusi\u00f3n en torno a  Ovidio y Pit\u00e1goras.                  SPAN-GA 2968.001            Title: Trance, Rapture, Ecstasy      Instructor: Dylon Robbins      Day/Time : Tuesday, 4-6pm       Description : In this course, we  will examine and discuss different \u201cinterruptions\u201d of consciousness and their  related sociabilities. The paradigms of trance, rapture, and ecstasy will  be invoked in our analysis of collective dancing manias, religious mysticism  and messianic movements, improvised music practices, texts authored by spirit  mediums, as well tendencies in ethnographic filmmaking. We will also  examine some of the pathologizations of these and related activities through a  discussion of syncope, paroxysm, onanism, and hysteria. The course seeks  to dialogue with contemporary theoretical discussions involving critiques of  populism as well as hauntology, the political economy of specters and zombies,  and the ambivalent valences of play. The seminar will be conducted in  English. Some of the readings will also be in Portuguese, Spanish, and  French, but generally translations will be made available.                  SPAN-GA 2975.001  (Same as COLIT-GA 2978.001)             Title: The End of Cervantes      Instructor: Jacques Lezra      Day/Time : Wednesday, 4-6pm       Description :      We  will study three related problems. How do concepts of \"end\"--as  a historical and as an analytic concept; ending, telos, conclusion...--work in  Cervantes's texts? What counts as a \"decision\" in Cervantes?   (Who decides what, under what conditions, with what consequences,  according to what rules...) And: in what ways does Cervantes's reflection  on \"ends\" provide a critique of disciplinarity, including  philology? Readings will include (some of) Cervantes's theatre and prose;  Schmitt, Luhmann, Maturana, Latour, Deleuze; essays on decidability and  completeness.                    SPAN-GA 2977.001          Title : Comparatism, Contingency, and the Caribbean  Instructor : Ana Dopico  Day/Time : Tuesday, 12:30-3:15pm  (This course originates in Comparative Literature)  \u201cThe  Caribbean,\u201d as David Scott has argued, \u201cis not merely modern\u2026. it is modern in  a fundamentally inaugural way.\u201d What does it mean to think of the Caribbean as  an inaugural imaginary? And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host  of thinkers, writers and artists of the nineteenth and twentieth century have  insisted on the centrality of the Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding  of modernity and its elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire,  sovereignty and simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or  tragically, revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think  beyond the dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation,  archipelago and diaspora. This demands too that we read beyond the  tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor forms and  minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic and  theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and contingencies  within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It requires the  capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and simultaneously engage  the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency, misunderstanding, as  well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of domination, transaction and  subordination.          This  course considers key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads  them comparatively and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional  and postcolonial inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and  lesser-known expressions, major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten  forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments of the Caribbean  have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments, insurgent movements  and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of literature to the  epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural practices, aiming  both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for  example, have we come to understand the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban  Revolution within grand narratives and what would it mean to read in them not  epic, tragic destinies but more banal parables about modernity \u2014destinies  consonant with other forms of communal politics, other orders of transaction  and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from Berlin to Grenada? Comparative  questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of revolution  and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the specificity  of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of literature  and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature compete with  visual aesthetics? How do we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or  desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy  the postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like Franz Kafka?      We  will also ask about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the  reparative poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We  will engage the divisions between Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone  Caribbean studies and trace cultural and theoretical genealogies and  segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a common culture beyond the major  tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars have used to bind literary  production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What  is the place of the Caribbean in the conceptions and political destinies of the  American hemisphere or the Global South?      The  syllabus is still in progress but will include selections from major canonical  Caribbean texts (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach,  Marinello, Ortiz, Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming), theorists  and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant, Moreno Fraginals,  Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature  (Carpentier, Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through  to the post-colonial Caribbean Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers  from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We will consider the formation  of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques ,  to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic and activist  interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual practices in the  academy.
