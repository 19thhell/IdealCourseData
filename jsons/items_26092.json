(MPAET-UE courses taken before Fall 2014 are exempt from this grade requirement.) If a student receives a grade lower than a C, that student must retake the course to improve the grade. Students may retake only one course once. Students may retake a maximum of 4 courses throughout their undergraduate studies to improve their grades. Students unable to meet these academic standards will be referred to the department&rsquo;s committee on student progress and may be advised into an alternative major at NYU.    Educational Theatre majors matriculating at NYU in Fall 2014 or later are expected to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 in order to make satisfactory academic progress .

Along with the studio classes, students will have the opportunity to meet and have their work critiqued by contemporary artists. This program is free of charge . The Visionary Studio ( scheduled on 4 of the Saturdays, TBD ) part of the program brings in working artists to lecture about their work and critique projects done in the classroom. Students will have an opportunity to ask questions and acquire more in depth knowledge of what it means to be an artist in the modern age.    On the final day of the program, we will bring in several artists and Steinhardt alumni for a final critique of the work done during the entire program. The following day, we will have a one-day final exhibition of the work in the art building, opened to all family and friends. During the exhibition, all work will be documented for the students and given to them for their final portfolio.    With these workshops we aim to not only help teenagers find their voices through art, but also in everyday life. As part of the class, each student presents his/her own work, thus affording the opportunity to hone communication and presentation skills. We feel that this part of the program helps to develop skills, which can be useful in preparation for college, and ultimately outside the classroom. High school students must apply with a portfolio of work to be admitted to the Advanced Workshop.    Spring 2015 Advanced Art Workshop    The next workshops will be offered on nine Saturdays this spring from 9:30am-12:30pm:    2/28, 3/7, 3/14, 3/21, 3/28, 4/18, 4/25, 5/2, 5/9 Plus Sunday 5/10, Final Exhibition &amp; Reception *Visionary Studio lecture series will meet from 1:00-3:00pm on dates TBD. If accepted to participate, attendance in all of these dates is mandatory.    Advanced Art Workshop Descriptions    Sculpture In this class, students will learn two different ways of making sculpture. The first half of this course will engage students in the basic processes of moldmaking with plaster and clay. You will cast objects of their choosing using press molding and slip casting, and have the option of firing their work. The second half of this course will focus on soft sculpture as a medium, using various types of textiles. Technical skills such as machine and hand sewing, grommetting, and basic pattern making will be covered. Students will use these skills to respond to basic sculptural prompts. Additionally, students will participate in class critiques of their projects. Brief lectures will be given on contemporary sculpture.    Experimental Painting This class, as opposed to the traditional introductory classes in painting which usually focus on basic technique, will take a more modern approach to painting and focus on what we as contemporary viewers value from painting today. The goal is not to dismiss technique (for it is obviously very important) but to expose younger students who might not otherwise have the chance, to what it means to be a painter today. Experimentation will be key, not for its own sake, but for the rewards that will arise from trial and error.    Photo/Digital Art This course will include an introduction to several techniques in creating digital artwork. Students will learn basic skills in image and video editing software, which will provide the basis for completing several class projects, as well as discuss how digital techniques can be useful in creating traditional works. The class will begin by looking at digital photography/collage and progress into video and the moving image. Further, we will be looking at a number of contemporary and modern artists working in the field as a means of contextualizing work completed in the class.
