The following items may be needed, depending on personal preference, in all residence halls unless otherwise indicated in the information about your specific residence hall in the residence hall pages:     Bedding/linens  You will need extra long (80 inch) twin bed size flat and fitted sheets, blankets, bedspreads, and pillows.

Refrigerator and/or microwave  Apartment-style residence halls all have refrigerators, and some identified on the residence hall web pages above have microwaves. Other residents may bring a small refrigerator (less than 5 cubic feet) and/or microwave. Coordinate plans with roommates/suitemates to avoid duplication and space problems.   Room amenities  Students may bring non-halogen desk or floor lamps, rugs (except in carpeted residence halls identified on the residence hall web pages above), posters, alarm clock, and clothes hangers. All windows have blinds, so curtains are not needed. TVs and speakers should be compact and equipped with headphones to allow use without disturbing roommates.

Residents may bring their own computers, or purchase them through the special programs at the NYU Computer Store.          What Not to Bring:     Furniture (except small book shelves)  Each room is furnished with a twin bed, desk, desk chair, and storage space for clothing for each student.

Medical documentation is required to support the request.   Air conditioners   Candles or Incense     Drugs and other controlled substances without prescription   Electric heaters   Flammable decorations including natural or artificial Christmas trees   Halogen lamps   Hot plates, toasters, toaster ovens, grills, or other open flame or heating coil devices   Pets or animals of any kind.

Storage:   There is no storage space for students' use in public areas of the residence halls. Please do not bring more personal property than you can keep within your room.
