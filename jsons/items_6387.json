Description       Through an examination of Cinema Verit\u00e9, Direct Cinema, and ethnographic film this course will examine the ways in which filmmakers, writers and social scientists have sought innovative ways to account for cultural difference and bias. We will explore how \u201cthe other\u201d is represented, and how such representations always mirror the one doing the observing. By Focusing on the 1950s and 1960s, we also trace how readings and films shift away from master narratives and colonialist discourses. Class readings include Franz Fanon\u2019s\u00a0 Black Skin, White Masks \u00a0; classic ethnographies by Marvin Harris, Clifford Geertz, and Bronislaw Malinowski; Elizabeth Warnock Fernea\u2019s\u00a0 Guests of the Sheikh \u00a0, and Norman Mailer\u2019s\u00a0 Armies of the Night \u00a0.

Description       Through an examination of Cinema Verit\u00e9, Direct Cinema, and ethnographic film this course will examine the ways in which filmmakers, writers and social scientists have sought innovative ways to account for cultural difference and bias. We will explore how \u201cthe other\u201d is represented, and how such representations always mirror the one doing the observing. By Focusing on the 1950s and 1960s, we also trace how readings and films shift away from master narratives and colonialist discourses. Class readings include Franz Fanon\u2019s\u00a0 Black Skin, White Masks \u00a0; classic ethnographies by Marvin Harris, Clifford Geertz, and Bronislaw Malinowski; Elizabeth Warnock Fernea\u2019s\u00a0 Guests of the Sheikh \u00a0, and Norman Mailer\u2019s\u00a0 Armies of the Night \u00a0. Films include Robert Flaherty\u2019s\u00a0 Nanook of the North \u00a0, Robert Gardner\u2019s\u00a0 Dead Birds \u00a0, Jean Rouch\u2019s\u00a0 Les ma\u00eetres fous, Chronicle of a Summer \u00a0by Edgar Morin, Chris Marker and Jean Rouch, Frederick Wiseman\u2019s\u00a0 Titticut Follies \u00a0, David and Albert Maysles\u2019s\u00a0 Gimme Shelter \u00a0, and Maya Deren\u2019s\u00a0 Ritual in Transfigured Time. \u00a0Class assignments will also include visits to the Museum of Natural History, Anthology Film Archives, and Union Docs.
