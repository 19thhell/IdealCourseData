on specialized clinical practice skills in engagement, assessment, treatment, and prevention with adolescents and their families. It provides in-depth, culturally competent clinical knowledge and skills in areas of practice most relevant to work with adolescents and their families seen in diverse urban practice settings (health/mental health, psychiatric, youth development, community-based agencies, schools, day/residential treatment) and/or private practice. It is designed for clinicians as well as supervisors and program directors specializing in practice with adolescents.   The program will provide a multicultural perspective inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual identity, and disability. It will also incorporate opportunities for participants to apply new theoretical knowledge and skills to their ongoing clinical practice with adolescents and families.

Classroom and case discussions helped us translate those perspectives, theories, and concepts into our own work environment.

It is designed for clinicians as well as supervisors and program directors specializing in practice with adolescents.   The program will provide a multicultural perspective inclusive of gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual identity, and disability. It will also incorporate opportunities for participants to apply new theoretical knowledge and skills to their ongoing clinical practice with adolescents and families.
