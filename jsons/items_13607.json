The  emphasis of the course is on practical application and the development of sound  instruction skills, with attention to empirical justification for  methodological choices drawn from research. The course is designed to acquaint  the student with a broad range of background skills, activity formats and media  that can be used to enhance the proficiency-oriented teaching/learning  experience at the university level. The seminar format requires that all  students contribute to classroom discussions. Outside reading is therefore  criticalto successful performance in the course.      This is a zero  credit, Pass/Fail course. All PhD and  MFA students teaching in the language program for the first time are required  to enroll.             SPAN-GA 2960.001      Title: Archival  Theory through Queer/Colonial/State Archives      Instructor: Zeb Tortorici  Day/Time: Wednesday, 3:00-6:00pm      Description: This course interrogates the notion of the \u201carchive\u201d that has been  radically opened up by activists, archivists, and scholars in recent decades.  This includes, among other things, grassroots activism, radical  historiographies, embodied methodologies, oral histories, cultural ephemera,  film and photography, pornography, art and performance. As we explore the  ways in which archives are often symbolic colonizing and nationalist projects,  we will also think about how archives and documentary collections become sites  of activism. We will also analyze colonial archives, alternative literacies,  digital archives and processes of digitization, access to archives, embodied  research methodologies, the body as archive, oral histories, LGBT/queer  archives, and other public memory projects. How do some archival  narratives privilege models of historical subject recovery, such that they  purport to recuperate (and define) particular voices and subjectivities of the  past? How do such archival engagements reassert and/or rupture traditional  notions of archival authority? How are archives mediated spaces, and how  do archival voices undergo several stages of transmission and filtering?       Through  the course, we will elucidate \u201caffective archival encounters,\u201d as  influenced by language, race, ethnicity, gender, age, and subject of research.  We will also examine the specific ways in which particular desires\u2014archival,  historical, and political\u2014serve to inform the logics, subjects, and erasures of  archives. As such, a significant component of this course will be our own  personal and intellectual engagements with archives and the documents they  house. The course will likely include scheduled visits to two or three archival  collections in New York City, such as the Lesbian Herstory Archives, the Fales  Library and Special Collections, the NYU Hemispheric Institute archive, the New  York Public Library Manuscripts and Archives Division (and their Gay and  Lesbian Collection), and the Hispanic Society of America\u2019s Manuscripts and Rare  Books Collection.            * NOTE: This course appears in Albert as  \u201cArchives, Archival Theory, and Early Modern Spanish Paleography,\u201d but our  course will consist of weekly two-hour discussions, with an optional third hour  for those graduate students who want to gain the practical knowledge and  paleographic skills necessary to read seventeenth- and eighteenth-century  Spanish-language archival documents.        SPAN-GA 2965.001      Title: Seminar in Theory: Poetics and Philosophy      Instructor: Gabriela Basterra      Day/Time: Tuesday, 5:00-7:00pm      Description:   Placing poetic, artistic and philosophical texts in conversation, this seminar explores the constitution of ethical and poetic subjectivity. How do we figure ourselves as acting and creating subjects? The subject is imagined to emerge in relation to what is other, but who or what is the other, and what is its relationship with what we call subject? Beyond referring to another person, the word 'other' may also express what is imagined as a constitutive event, the other of thought that escapes representation, the materiality of the body, the addressee of poems, self-standing products of the imagination, and indeed the otherness of the subject to itself. Our exploration will be at once philosophical and poetic, because what constitutes subjectivity does not always have a place in language. Hence the challenges animating our texts and discussions: how can something we envision as exceeding representation (as appearing to thought as a lapse) signal itself? How do emptiness and materiality, silence and voice, negation and objectivity, interact? What would it be like to consider philosophical texts by focusing not only on their logical reasoning but also on the performativity of their language, on the ways in which their language acts? We will devote extensive attention to Immanuel Kant's theoretical and practical philosophy and to Emmanuel Levina's philosophical writing. We will seek inspiration in Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, in essays by Saussure, Heidegger, Leo Steinberg, Barbara Johnson, Giorgio Agamben, Ernesto Laclau, and in a range of poetic and artistic texts, including Aeschylus, Sophocles, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, Jean Racine, John Keats, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, Wallace Stevens, Francis Ponge, Gerardo Diego, Pedro Salinas, Samuel Beckett, Jorge Luis Borges, Lisel Mueller, Ana Rossetti.      SPAN-GA 2965.002      Title: The  Concept of Will in Modern Aesthetics      Instructor: Eduardo  Subirats      Day/Time: Monday,  6:15-8:00pm      Description: This  seminar will focus on five major works of Western aesthetics: Kant, Schiller,  Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. It will reconstruct central categories such  as form, beauty, genius, and myth. It also will focus on a central category:  the metaphysical (not moral) concept of will. Its ultimate goal is a critique  of contemporary artistic decadence, literary commercialism and anti-  aesthetics.  Bibliography: Kant, Critique of Judgement - Introduction (Xerox) Schiller, Letters Upon The Aesthetic Education of Man , Kessinger's Publishing Hegel, Introductory Lectures on Aesthetics , Penguin Classics Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation , Dover Publications Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy , Penguin Classics       SPAN-GA 2966.001   Title:  Art and Engagement:  The Responsibility of Intellectuals       Instructors: Jordana Mendelson      Day/Time: Monday, 4:00-6:00 pm                      SPAN-GA 2968.001            (This course originates in Comparative Literature)            Title: Reading the  Global South: Uneven  Development, Critical Geography, and Anti-Imperial Thinking            Instructor: Ana Dopico            Day/Time: Tuesday, 1:00-3:00pm           This course seeks to create a comparative ground for  cultural politics typically separated by language, imperial histories, and  neo-colonial maps. It takes up the cultural, political, historical and  theoretical consequences of uneven development as an enduring truth of the  global order. It engages the politics and economies of imperialism and  the history and theory of anti-imperialism. We will consider the idea of  the Global South as a topography of uneven development and uneven temporalities,  where notions of modernity and periphery are affirmed and contested and where  the names and practices of resistance, rebellion, and critique continue to  engage not only metropolitan centers but the force of the state. The  course looks beyond \u201carea studies\u201d definitions and seeks a materialist  and critical geography, turning toward a hemispheric Southern critique that  challenged empire, globalization, democratization, neoliberalism and  permanent warfare long before the current political moment. We will trace  the political and critical genealogies, the disciplinary canonizations, and the  popular life of an indispensable contestatory archive\u2014an archive whose long  history helps to contextualize and demystify the geopolitics of the present, as  well as the politics of the academy. The course is in part designed to  offer comparatists and students from varied fields an engagement with texts  whose messy political engagements and materialist foundations have lately been  rather marginalized by a reaffirmation of theoretical universals.     We will consider how old ideological mappings like third  world, underdevelopment, revolution and old imperial and cold wars continue to  haunt new articulations of triumphalist or cataclysmic futures and geopolitical  destinies. The course traces themes and variations of a global  anti-imperialism, its constituencies, and its critical strategies; it stresses  how these contestatory narratives have irrevocably altered the cultural  politics and cultural markets of international metropoli and international  policy. It seeks also to distinguish \u201csouthern\u201d contexts for struggles  around feminism, race and labor, and to follow the trajectory of these  struggles into a theoretical \u201cmainstream\u201d. Readings establish  connections between nationalist struggles, critiques of hegemony, and resistant  narratives, looking back over almost a century of foundational texts from  Luxemburg to Gramsci, to Mari\u00e1tegui, to Fanon and Memmi and   connecting them to the work of writers as varied as Said, Chatterjee, Garc\u00eda Canclini,  Pratt, Spivak, Jameson and Appadurai. The course will proceed  thematically as a wide survey of history, criticism, and theory but always  considering forms of cultural production that often precede and exceed  theorization. Thematics include:      Reading the Present: The Politics of  Disaster, Capitalism      Crisis Theory: Permanent Warfare,  Imperialism, Geography      Ideological Mapping: The South  Hegemony, Politics      Decolonization, Violence, Revolution      Critical Geographies and   Underdevelopment      World Systems, Spaces of Capital, Cultural  Economies      Genealogies of Post-Colonialism:   Methodologies of the Contact Zone      Critiques of Nationalism      Time and Power: Modernity,  Postmodernity, Belatedness      Third World Productions: Magical  Realism, National Allegory and Pastiche      The Ascent of the Postcolonial and the  Politics of Disciplines      Gendered Revolutions/Feminist Territories      Treacherous Intellectuals and the Politics of  Presence      Permanent Warfare, the End of Utopia and the  Long Half-Life of the Cold War         SPAN-GA 2975.001       (This course originates in History)             Title: The Early-Modern  Iberian Monarchies: from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic            Instructor: Pedro Cardim            Day/Time: Monday, 9:30am \u2013 12:15pm       Description:  Offered as a  colloquia, this course examines the history of the Iberian monarchies from the  late 15 th to the late 18 th century. It aims to provide  students with an ample, detailed and up-to-date knowledge of the Spanish and  Portuguese monarchies, and to provide the basis for comparison between these  political entities and other imperial organizations across space and time. The  course offers a substantial amount of required and optional readings to be  presented and discussed in class. The readings reflect the simultaneous  expansion of the Iberian monarchies, both in Europe and across the broader  Atlantic world.            The class meets once per week. The  first part of each session is allotted to a lecture by the professor, while the  second part is devoted to an oral presentation by students, followed by  discussion. Lectures supplement and complement reading assignments, and  introduce problems to be raised in the discussion period. In the discussion,  students will analyze problems and interpretations from the readings and/or  lectures from each week. Outlines of lectures, maps and other supplementary  material will be distributed to students on the web.        SPAN-GA 2978.001 ( This course originates in CLACS ) Title : Latin American and Caribbean Intellectual History Instructor : Dylon Robbins Day/Time : Monday, 12:00pm - 2:30pm  Description: In   this course, we will explore some of the key texts and ideas in the   intellectual history of Latin America and the Caribbean. How have Latin   American and Caribbean intellectuals approached the problems of culture   and difference? How have they theorized the state, civil society, or   the public sphere? How have notions of gender, heterogeneity, race and   ethnicity, and nationalism related to their historical contexts? A   review of texts including \u00c1ngel Rama, Jean Franco, Gilberto Freyre,   Marilena Chaui, Fernando Ortiz, Suely Rolnik, Roberto Schwarz, Jamaica   Kincaid, C.L.R.
