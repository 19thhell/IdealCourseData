Faculty members are drawn from several departments and institutes of New York University and approach the region from a wide variety of disciplines and perspectives.      Students in the program will concentrate on the ancient Near East or Egypt, but the study of neighboring ancient cultures and comparative work is strongly encouraged, facilitated by NYU's impressive faculty in Classics and Hebrew & Judaic Studies. The small size of the program means that students will receive individual guidance in tailoring their programs specifically to their needs and interests, but will have access to the tremendous resources of the university and the city of New York.           Applications for Fall 2015 are due no later than January 4, 2015. Note that the program will only be accepting MA applications for Fall 2015; no fellowships for the doctoral program have been allocated for this admissions cycle, and therefore no applications for the PhD program can be accepted .
