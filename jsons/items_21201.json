Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           The primary purpose of the microeconomics core course is to enable you to use microeconomic thinking, concepts and tools in your professional public service work. Accomplishing this also requires refreshing and strengthening your quantitative skills.      The course begins with the basics of supply and demand and market operations, and uses this as the context for considering consumer and organizational decisions within a given market structure. The course builds to applying economic analysis to a variety of public issues such as the effects of taxation, the market structure of health care, the impacts of the minimum wage, the effects of international trade and various approaches to environmental externalities.      By the end of the course you should be able to articulate the economic context and analysis of a public problem, use economic concepts in managerial and policy decisions, and progress to second level courses confident of your understanding of microeconomics and its tools.

The course begins with the basics of supply and demand and market operations, and uses this as the context for considering consumer and organizational decisions within a given market structure.

Located in a school of public service rather than in a medical or public health school, our program crosses traditional boundaries, linking management, finance, policy, and providing students with the cutting-edge concepts and skills needed to shape the future of health policy and management.   Students receive a set of tools and experiences that allow them to understand both the delivery of health care services and the broader social, cultural, and economic factors that influence health outcomes. Our students experience firsthand the importance of health care delivery and health promotion in one of the most interesting, diverse, and complex cities in the world, and our graduates work in every sector of the health care system.
