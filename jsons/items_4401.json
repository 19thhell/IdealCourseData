Through close and critical readings of primary texts we will explore how certain themes (e.g. justice, truth, love, desire, writing, persuasion) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves from one another throughout classical antiquity. Throughout our study we will take gender as a guiding question, asking how the texts construct and portray gender, how gender is deployed as an organizing principle, and how conceptions of gender are thereby developed and consolidated in them. Authors include Homer, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Horace, Longinus, and various recent commentators. All readings will be in translation; students with Greek/Latin are encouraged to refer to the original texts.  Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity  Iampolski   Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of violence and social exclusion. The following subjects will be discussed: individual and masses in modern society; violence and modern war; totalitarianism; mechanization of life, alienation, machines; the emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; market, capitalism, and many others.  Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Literature of Dictatorship in Spain and Latin America Matos-Martin This course will analyze representations of the traumatic dictatorial histories of Spain and the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) from a comparative perspective. We will focus on literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, fiction films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Manuel Rivas, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Luisa Valenzuela, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Isaac Rosa, Mario Benedetti, Eduardo Galeano, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn Villaronga, and Ken Loach. Primary materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Theory of Narrative Sanders Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Conrad, Robbe-Grillet, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. We shall also explore issues of filmic narrative as arise in the adaptation of novels for the screen. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, and others.  Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticisms Sieburth Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century. Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism. Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad). After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein. The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution. We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA 997) to complete the honors thesis.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans Lezra \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Metropolis and World Literature Zhang As an introduction to the concept and discipline of comparative literature, this course examines how modern metropolises in different parts of the world nourish and challenge literary sensibilities, and how modern literature, by treating the city as both its environment and its hero, evolves from realism to modernism and beyond. Our goal is two-fold: On the one hand, and more immediately concerning literature, it seeks to revive Goethe\u2019s notion of Weltliteratur (world literature) in our own time, not by searching for an overarching theme of human experience and culture in which a universal definition of humanity can be reached once and for all, but only by going through different historical, social, and national situations which manifest themselves in terms of cultural and political differences and self-assertions. On the other hand, and regarding a broader interest in the city itself and its representation in the major works of world literature and film, the course is also intended to engage in common issues of our times such as individuality versus community and collectivity; locality versus globality; past versus present, as they are mediated and intensified by urban forms, experiences, and sensibilities. By hopping from city to city, we hope to construct a trajectory of world literature and its world-historical moments of intensity, which is often articulated through the self-images of the great cities. We will be particularly concerned with how the city and literary imagination interact with one another; how the city can be seen as a producer of cultures, subjectivities, diversity, dissent, and unity; and how the urban experience shapes our understanding of time, space, self, and other. The course is also an imagined field trip to some of the major cities on the literary and intellectual map of the modern world. We will visit London in Charles Dickens and T.S. Eliot; Paris in Hugo, Baudelaire, and Flaubert; Dublin in Joyce, Berlin in Water Benjamin; St. Petersburgh in Dostoyevsky and Andre Bely, New York in Dreiser and Fitzgerald, and finally, across the Pacific, Shanghai, and Beijing, the two urban centers that capture the imagination of modern China as they are portrayed in Lao She and Mao Dun, two leading writers of Chinese realist literature. The EuroAmreican and East Asian focus is by no means limiting. There will be a few classes reserved for students who are interested in reading and discussing other cities in other national literary and cultural traditions. Our readings will be centrally literary but some films will be introduced, both as a visual aid and more importantly a different regime of senses and symbolisms entangled with the city. Each class period will be divided into a short lecture and sustained discussions. Students are also expected to do class presentations and act as discussion leaders. Grades will be based on a 1-2 pp weekly journal on the assignment, and a 10pp final paper.

Through close and critical readings of primary texts we will explore how certain themes (e.g. justice, truth, love, desire, writing, persuasion) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves from one another throughout classical antiquity. Throughout our study we will take gender as a guiding question, asking how the texts construct and portray gender, how gender is deployed as an organizing principle, and how conceptions of gender are thereby developed and consolidated in them. Authors include Homer, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Horace, Longinus, and various recent commentators. All readings will be in translation; students with Greek/Latin are encouraged to refer to the original texts.  Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity  Iampolski   Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of violence and social exclusion. The following subjects will be discussed: individual and masses in modern society; violence and modern war; totalitarianism; mechanization of life, alienation, machines; the emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; market, capitalism, and many others.  Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Literature of Dictatorship in Spain and Latin America Matos-Martin This course will analyze representations of the traumatic dictatorial histories of Spain and the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) from a comparative perspective. We will focus on literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, fiction films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Manuel Rivas, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Luisa Valenzuela, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Isaac Rosa, Mario Benedetti, Eduardo Galeano, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn Villaronga, and Ken Loach. Primary materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Theory of Narrative Sanders Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Conrad, Robbe-Grillet, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. We shall also explore issues of filmic narrative as arise in the adaptation of novels for the screen. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, and others.  Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticisms Sieburth Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century. Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism. Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad). After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein. The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution. We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA 997) to complete the honors thesis.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans Lezra \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Metropolis and World Literature Zhang As an introduction to the concept and discipline of comparative literature, this course examines how modern metropolises in different parts of the world nourish and challenge literary sensibilities, and how modern literature, by treating the city as both its environment and its hero, evolves from realism to modernism and beyond. Our goal is two-fold: On the one hand, and more immediately concerning literature, it seeks to revive Goethe\u2019s notion of Weltliteratur (world literature) in our own time, not by searching for an overarching theme of human experience and culture in which a universal definition of humanity can be reached once and for all, but only by going through different historical, social, and national situations which manifest themselves in terms of cultural and political differences and self-assertions. On the other hand, and regarding a broader interest in the city itself and its representation in the major works of world literature and film, the course is also intended to engage in common issues of our times such as individuality versus community and collectivity; locality versus globality; past versus present, as they are mediated and intensified by urban forms, experiences, and sensibilities. By hopping from city to city, we hope to construct a trajectory of world literature and its world-historical moments of intensity, which is often articulated through the self-images of the great cities. We will be particularly concerned with how the city and literary imagination interact with one another; how the city can be seen as a producer of cultures, subjectivities, diversity, dissent, and unity; and how the urban experience shapes our understanding of time, space, self, and other. The course is also an imagined field trip to some of the major cities on the literary and intellectual map of the modern world. We will visit London in Charles Dickens and T.S. Eliot; Paris in Hugo, Baudelaire, and Flaubert; Dublin in Joyce, Berlin in Water Benjamin; St. Petersburgh in Dostoyevsky and Andre Bely, New York in Dreiser and Fitzgerald, and finally, across the Pacific, Shanghai, and Beijing, the two urban centers that capture the imagination of modern China as they are portrayed in Lao She and Mao Dun, two leading writers of Chinese realist literature. The EuroAmreican and East Asian focus is by no means limiting. There will be a few classes reserved for students who are interested in reading and discussing other cities in other national literary and cultural traditions. Our readings will be centrally literary but some films will be introduced, both as a visual aid and more importantly a different regime of senses and symbolisms entangled with the city. Each class period will be divided into a short lecture and sustained discussions. Students are also expected to do class presentations and act as discussion leaders. Grades will be based on a 1-2 pp weekly journal on the assignment, and a 10pp final paper.

Cities on Edge: The Megalopolis of the Global South in Chronicle, Fiction and Film    Dopico      This course surveys the life of six cities from the global South whose identities,  culture, politics, and everyday life have been shaped by massive growth, urban  migration, global and local uneven development. Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Rio De Janeiro/Sao Paulo, Cairo, and Mumbai/Bombay  have a long history of grand ambitions and grand inequities, modern  transformations and modern dislocations, and each reveals a specific national  and political context. This course will  be devoted to their recent past. Through  literature, non-fiction, and film, we will consider how these cities live on  the double-edge of hyper-modernity and  urban viability, falling under that evocative rubric of megalopolis. We will  look back at modernization, massive growth, and political upheaval. Through novels and reportage and cinema, we  will examine how these cities have amassed financial and cultural capital and  produced an impressive cultural archive, while at the same time engulfing  millions of human beings who live beyond the margins of poverty. In these slums, poblaciones and favelas mass  urban migrations have created shadow cities that serve as a negative for the  rationalized landscapes of metropolitan growth. These  populations are excluded from the democratizing opportunities of metropolitan  life, but they have transformed the idea and the identity of the city, and the  way that city-dwellers live, define, and imagine their  lives in the megalopolis. The  contemporary megalopolis and its precursor, the metropolitan capital,  hold an extraordinary prominence in the imaginaries of modernity and  postmodernity, and we will turn to representations of urban life in journalism,  essay, non-fiction chronicles, literature, and cinema. Our coursework and  our discussions will cut across inter-disciplinary lines to establish a  responsible context for each city. While  we will concentrate on the lives of these megalopoli, we will begin by  reflecting on the city as a function of the modern imaginary and on the city\u2019s  indispensable connection to notions of nation and modernity. We will  also consider how the social, political and economic conditions that shape the  narratives and popular fictions of the metropolis are grounded in diversities  and inequities common to other cities of  the global South (like Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Nairobi, Habana,etc.)         Topics in 20th Century Literature: Transnational America    Garcia    Beginning with  Randolph Bourne's \u201cTrans-National America\u201d (1916), this seminar explores the  transnational dimensions of 20th century American literature. Concentrating  on distinct moments in U.S. literary history, including the Harlem Renaissance  era, the Second World War, and the post 9/11 period, we consider different spatial  meanings attached to \u201cAmerica\u201d by moving chronologically from the early twentieth-century  to the early twenty-first. Throughout, we examine cultural  and intellectual histories that bear on our readings and juxtapose historical  artifacts with literary texts. Themes include literary treatments of  racialization and ethnicization; national belonging as cultural politics; and  divergent figurative and renderings of the U.S. during the \u201cAmerican Century.\u201d Readings  include works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois,  Pietro di Donato, Richard Wright, and Saul Bellow, among others.          Junior Theory Seminar: Texts and Its Meaning    Iampolski    This class explores the question 'where does meaning come from?\" and other topics such as the ontological theory of meaning, sophistics, stoics, on corporeals, hermeneutics, and more. Readings include Kafka, Levi-Strauss, Barthes, Heidegger, Sartre, Deleuze, Yuri Olesha, Paul Ricoeur, Kant, Shklovksy, and more.        Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans    Lezra    \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films?

Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.        Art Before the Law: Busted! Drugs, Law and Literature    Ronell    The relation to drugs, complex and often covert, has been under-theorized and is still in many ways disavowed. Is there such a thing as a truly drug-free zone in the realms of thinking, the sacred, or in the domains of artistic and musical articulation? We will conduct a sober exploration of the addictive qualities that contour modern literature, philosophy, and cultural formations. Ranging from Nietzsche to Freud to Heidegger and Derrida, from Thomas de Quincey to Flaubert as well as contemporary fiction, poetry (and music), we will examine the intoxicated states on which thought and the poetic word may well rely. The relation of the addicted subject to law will serve as a focal point. The notion of dependency will be deconstructed. Expect a sustained intellectual high!        Colonialism &amp; the Rise of Modern African Literature: South African Literature After Apartheid    Sanders    For more than 40 years, apartheid provided the critical  frame of reference for South African literature, as writers lent their pens to  opposing (and in certain cases defending) the system of racial separation and  white minority rule. What has become of South African literature in the years  after 1994, the year after the country\u2019s first non-racial elections? To what  extent have writers imagined a South Africa different from the one they  inherited? In this course we will explore, among other things, the influence of  the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on prose, poetry and drama of the late  1990s, the response of writers to the xenophobic violence of 2008, as well as  allied developments in the animated films of William Kentridge, and the music  videos of Die Antwoord (The Answer), Spoek Mathambo and others. Authors to  include, among others, J.M. Coetzee, Antjie Krog, and Phaswane Mpe. Readings  will be in English and/or in translation from Afrikaans and Zulu.
