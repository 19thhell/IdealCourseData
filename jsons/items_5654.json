Through didactic and clinical teaching, students receive required knowledge and skills to fulfill the fundamental prosthodontic needs of patients. Department teaching will focus on foundation knowledge, teach the latest techniques and evaluate clinical competency to provide quality prosthodontic care for patients. In addition to the prosthodontic needs of the patient, students will be able to understand comprehensive care of their patient to achieve optimal oral health, esthetics and function.   The Department of Prosthodontics has an oversight of the Prosthodontic curriculum of the Doctorate of Dental Surgery, which is designed such that students go through simulation and bench courses to learn the fundamental skills and evolve to more complex prosthodontic cases in the Advanced Prosthodontics course and clinics. Courses are evaluated and updated annually for contents and are augmented with technology to teach the latest techniques in Prosthodontics within comprehensive treatment planning, Implant Dentistry, Occlusion and Aesthetics.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    developing clinical expertise Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   The prosthodontic curriculum of the Doctorate of Dental Surgery is designed such that students go through simulation and bench courses to learn the fundamental skills evolving to more complex prosthodontic cases in the Advanced Prosthodontics course and clinics.

Through didactic and clinical teaching, students receive required knowledge and skills to fulfill the fundamental prosthodontic needs of patients. Department teaching will focus on foundation knowledge, teach the latest techniques and evaluate clinical competency to provide quality prosthodontic care for patients. In addition to the prosthodontic needs of the patient, students will be able to understand comprehensive care of their patient to achieve optimal oral health, esthetics and function.   The Department of Prosthodontics has an oversight of the Prosthodontic curriculum of the Doctorate of Dental Surgery, which is designed such that students go through simulation and bench courses to learn the fundamental skills and evolve to more complex prosthodontic cases in the Advanced Prosthodontics course and clinics. Courses are evaluated and updated annually for contents and are augmented with technology to teach the latest techniques in Prosthodontics within comprehensive treatment planning, Implant Dentistry, Occlusion and Aesthetics.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    developing clinical expertise Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   The prosthodontic curriculum of the Doctorate of Dental Surgery is designed such that students go through simulation and bench courses to learn the fundamental skills evolving to more complex prosthodontic cases in the Advanced Prosthodontics course and clinics.
