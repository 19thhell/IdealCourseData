         129 credits          Teaching and Learning majors matriculating at NYU in Fall 2014 or later are expected to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 in order to make satisfactory academic progress .    While we review all applications individually and holistically, our expectation is that all undergraduate students accepted for transfer into any of the teacher education programs at NYU Steinhardt, including Music Education, will have at least a cumulative B average in their coursework.
