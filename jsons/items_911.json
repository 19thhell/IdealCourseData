The Relational Orientation faculty hopes  that you find a personal and theoretical home here, one in which your own  professional development can deepen and flourish.            The  Relational Orientation has moved away from an emphasis on the role of  endogenous drives and \"one person\" psychologies toward a study of the  continuous interface of intrapsychic and Relational influences in and outside  the clinical situation. We come to the Relational position from a range  of theoretical orientations including Freudian, Object Relations, Self  Psychology and Interpersonal theories, and you will see evidence of these  earlier traditions in the courses you take with us. Relational ideas have  many roots from other disciplines that include [but are not limited to] social  constructivist and feminist theories, theories of intersubjectivity, infancy  and attachment research.            Relational  psychoanalysis focuses attention on processes of mutual influence in  development and treatment. We assume that relationships, including the analytic  one, are shaped by both individuals  in a process that is neither one sided nor linear. In this and  other ways Relational theorizing profoundly alters the analyst's thinking about  clinical work. We invite you to join us in studying older as well as  contemporary contributions to this orientation.      We offer courses that study the roots of Relational thinking in earlier  traditions \u2013 Freud, Klein, Bion, Fairbairn, Ferenczi, Kohut and Winnicott  - as well as contemporary theorizing. While some of our courses are  primarily theoretical in emphasis and others mainly clinical, all of our  courses address developments and controversies in clinical technique.            In  addition to coursework, the Relational Orientation offers many opportunities  for candidates to become involved during their training at Postdoc.   Friday night Colloquia, workshops and Sunday brunches in which you will get to  hear faculty and graduates present their work are ongoing events provided at no  cost to the candidates. Also, candidates are encouraged to join the  Relational Orientation via active participation in all aspects of programming,  including the executive committee, faculty selection committee, colloquium  committee, as well as program wide committees such as the yearly weekend  retreat planning committee, admissions committee and outreach committee.      Candidates who seek a thorough grounding in Relational thinking will be  provided with a suggested (but not required) that we believe will best build  your knowledge base. See below for the course sequence  recommendations. But regardless of the primary orientation to which you  subscribe, we warmly encourage you to sample our courses.

The composers contribute in a fundamental way, as well, to the critical debate, analysis, and presentation of new music in the Department. During their first two years, composers typically take one course in musicology, and one in ethnomusicology; for many, this experience is a rich source of new orientations. A more discrete discussion of issues in contemporary composition occurs in the Composers Seminar, and in the context of discussions with guests, regularly invited to teach or to speak in the Department's colloquium series. The Composition Seminar includes visits each semester by invited composers and theorists, and a several-day residency in the spring of each year brings a composer of international stature to participate in department activities under the aegis of the Samuel and Beverly Sirota Endowment for Music. Recent and future invitees include Helmut Lachenmann (2008), Maria de Alvear (2009), and Chaya Czernowin (2010). Areas supported by faculty expertise include critical theory, and music and the political; sound as embodiment; philosophy as a language or structure for addressing musicological questions; generative and explanatory models of music, including those non-parametrically oriented. Creative activity across a wide spectrum is embraced. Composers may choose to explore established chamber, orchestral or vocal genres, or experiment with new interstices between composer, performer, and audience. Many students choose to focus on computer music as an expressive medium, or as a tool for applications to their work in acoustic composition. Composition students receive department-sponsored performances of their works by professional ensembles. Students may also participate in First Performance, a graduate student-run organization dedicated to the presentation of new music. Past ensembles presenting concerts of student works at NYU have included the Arditti Quartet, the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE), Alarm Will Sound, the New York Virtuoso Singers, and the American Brass Quintet, among others. Resident groups for 2008-09 include the Jack String Quartet and TimeTable Percussion. The Washington Square Computer Music Studio is a comprehensive facility for graduate composition and research in electroacoustic music. The Washington Square Contemporary Music Society, co-sponsored by the Department, presents a three-concert new music series at Merkin Hall each year, often featuring faculty and student work. Our reasonably small program allows excellent advising, funding, and job placement. All of our graduate students receive tuition remission and MacCracken Fellowships . Our doctoral students may take courses at CUNY Graduate Center, Columbia University, the New School University, and other distinguished universities in the region though the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium.
