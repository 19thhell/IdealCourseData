When making your artistic review appointment, we will ask if you want to be considered for ALL STUDIOS or MUSIC THEATRE ONLY. Your answer will not impact your eligibility for the music theatre program. \"ALL STUDIOS\" OPTION These candidates will be considered for placement in the music theatre studio first. If we feel they are a good fit, we will place them there. If not, we will place them in one of the acting studios. \"MUSIC THEATRE ONLY\" OPTION This option is for those students who want to use their undergraduate experience to study music theatre. If we do not feel they are a match for our music theatre program, they will not be accepted into NYU.  2015 GUIDELINES  Updated October 21, 2014 ACTING EVALUATION\u2028 MONOLOGUES Two contrasting monologues - both contemporary We define \u201ccontemporary\u201d as anything written from the turn of the 20th century forward Each monologue must be under 2 minutes in length All monologues must be from published plays (no film or TV scripts and no original material) Please choose material that is within your age range (roles you would be cast in now) Props and costumes are not permitted We want to hear your natural voice. Please do not add an accent to your monologues CONVERSATION You   will have an opportunity to converse with your evaluator immediately   after presenting your monologues. This is a chance for us to get to   know you a little bit. We've watched your work as an artist and now we   want to learn about you as a person. WHAT TO BRING TO YOUR ARTISTIC REVIEW In   addition to uploading them digitally, you are required to bring three copies of your photograph and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the artistic review. You may A snapshot is   preferable, as long as you are recognizable in the photo. Please use   the proper format for a performing arts r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (more information in the   FAQ). Your evaluator will not accept additional material beyond the   photo and r\u00e9sum\u00e9. WHAT TO WEAR FOR YOUR ACTING AND SINGING EVALUATION Please wear clothing and shoes   that allow you to move comfortably in your audition. For those inclined   to wear heels, please keep them at a reasonable height. You are welcome   to perform barefoot.

The purpose of this evaluation is for us to learn where you are in your own dance/movement life. Are you a serious dancer with years of experience and training? Have you never taken a dance class but like to groove to your favorite song when it comes on the radio? Are you somewhere in between \u2014 perhaps you learned some choreography for a musical at school? We just want to know where you are right now. The Head of Dance at the New Studio on Broadway, which houses our music theatre program, will review and evaluate all candidates. In order for him to do this, we are providing a couple of different opportunities for candidates to be evaluated for dance. Freshperson music theatre candidates attending artistic reviews in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and transfer music theatre candidates in New York, will participate in a dance call, wherein they will be taught a combination incorporating elements of ballet and contemporary dance. Freshperson candidates attending artistic reviews in San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, and Miami, and transfer candidates attending in Chicago and Los Angeles, along with those submitting digital artistic reviews, will be required to submit a dance video. Both forms of submission will provide the necessary information for a proper evaluation. Brief descriptions of each can be found below. Detailed guidelines for submitting your dance video can be found in the PDFs to the right. DANCE CALL (Freshpeople in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and Transfers in New York Only) \u2028In small groups, candidates will be taught one combination that includes elements of ballet and some sort of contemporary dance (modern, jazz, Afro-centric, etc.). The purpose of the dance call is to assess your relationship to movement and your responsiveness to choreography.  \u2022 Please wear comfortable, fitted clothes that provide ease of movement  \u2022 You may wear ballet slippers, jazz shoes or no shoes (but no high-heeled character shoes) \u2022 You will have time to change into another outfit for your acting and singing evaluations \u2028DIGITAL DANCE SUBMISSION (Freshpeople in San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Transfers in Chicago and Los Angeles , and all Digitals ) If your audition city does not provide a dance call, you will be required to share with us a video of a one- to two-minute prepared dance solo to musical accompaniment. Choose your own music, which may include Broadway, hip-hop, classical or pop music, for example. Design your own choreography \u2014 by yourself or with help from a teacher or a dancer friend \u2014 and incorporate elements of dance that inspire you, like ballet, jazz, folk dance, tap or hip-hop. If you can think of it, you can use it. Include anything that showcases your use of the body as a creative instrument, demonstrating full body expressiveness and love of movement. The video must be created specifically for this artistic review. A clip from a previous performance is not acceptable. Please follow the more specific guidelines for submitting your dance video in the PDFs to the right.  Dance video deadlines apply only to candidates with in-person artistic reviews in cities which did not provide a dance call. Digital submission candidates have an earlier deadline for all five of their videos to be uploaded. SESSION TIMES\u2028 You will reserve either a morning or afternoon session for your artistic review. You should expect to be with us for the entire session. Sessions are approximately 3.5 hours. All candidates arrive at the same time to check in. For the most part, check-in for morning sessions begins at 9:00 and afternoon sessions at 2:00.

When making your artistic review appointment, we will ask if you want to be considered for ALL STUDIOS or MUSIC THEATRE ONLY. Your answer will not impact your eligibility for the music theatre program. \"ALL STUDIOS\" OPTION These candidates will be considered for placement in the music theatre studio first. If we feel they are a good fit, we will place them there. If not, we will place them in one of the acting studios. \"MUSIC THEATRE ONLY\" OPTION This option is for those students who want to use their undergraduate experience to study music theatre. If we do not feel they are a match for our music theatre program, they will not be accepted into NYU.  2015 GUIDELINES  Updated October 21, 2014 ACTING EVALUATION\u2028 MONOLOGUES Two contrasting monologues - both contemporary We define \u201ccontemporary\u201d as anything written from the turn of the 20th century forward Each monologue must be under 2 minutes in length All monologues must be from published plays (no film or TV scripts and no original material) Please choose material that is within your age range (roles you would be cast in now) Props and costumes are not permitted We want to hear your natural voice.

The purpose of this evaluation is for us to learn where you are in your own dance/movement life. Are you a serious dancer with years of experience and training? Have you never taken a dance class but like to groove to your favorite song when it comes on the radio? Are you somewhere in between \u2014 perhaps you learned some choreography for a musical at school? We just want to know where you are right now. The Head of Dance at the New Studio on Broadway, which houses our music theatre program, will review and evaluate all candidates. In order for him to do this, we are providing a couple of different opportunities for candidates to be evaluated for dance. Freshperson music theatre candidates attending artistic reviews in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and transfer music theatre candidates in New York, will participate in a dance call, wherein they will be taught a combination incorporating elements of ballet and contemporary dance. Freshperson candidates attending artistic reviews in San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, and Miami, and transfer candidates attending in Chicago and Los Angeles, along with those submitting digital artistic reviews, will be required to submit a dance video. Both forms of submission will provide the necessary information for a proper evaluation. Brief descriptions of each can be found below. Detailed guidelines for submitting your dance video can be found in the PDFs to the right. DANCE CALL (Freshpeople in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and Transfers in New York Only) \u2028In small groups, candidates will be taught one combination that includes elements of ballet and some sort of contemporary dance (modern, jazz, Afro-centric, etc.). The purpose of the dance call is to assess your relationship to movement and your responsiveness to choreography.  \u2022 Please wear comfortable, fitted clothes that provide ease of movement  \u2022 You may wear ballet slippers, jazz shoes or no shoes (but no high-heeled character shoes) \u2022 You will have time to change into another outfit for your acting and singing evaluations \u2028DIGITAL DANCE SUBMISSION (Freshpeople in San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Transfers in Chicago and Los Angeles , and all Digitals ) If your audition city does not provide a dance call, you will be required to share with us a video of a one- to two-minute prepared dance solo to musical accompaniment. Choose your own music, which may include Broadway, hip-hop, classical or pop music, for example. Design your own choreography \u2014 by yourself or with help from a teacher or a dancer friend \u2014 and incorporate elements of dance that inspire you, like ballet, jazz, folk dance, tap or hip-hop. If you can think of it, you can use it. Include anything that showcases your use of the body as a creative instrument, demonstrating full body expressiveness and love of movement. The video must be created specifically for this artistic review. A clip from a previous performance is not acceptable. Please follow the more specific guidelines for submitting your dance video in the PDFs to the right.  Dance video deadlines apply only to candidates with in-person artistic reviews in cities which did not provide a dance call. Digital submission candidates have an earlier deadline for all five of their videos to be uploaded. SESSION TIMES\u2028 You will reserve either a morning or afternoon session for your artistic review. You should expect to be with us for the entire session. Sessions are approximately 3.5 hours. All candidates arrive at the same time to check in. For the most part, check-in for morning sessions begins at 9:00 and afternoon sessions at 2:00.

Advanced Acting technique courses will emphasize the ensemble and include performance opportunities in heightened language and contemporary drama, with an emphasis on global cultural perspectives and emerging contemporary aesthetics. (Music Theatre students will do fewer text based acting roles to allow for musical performance experience.) Advanced Music Theater students will work in collaborations with the acclaimed Tisch Graduate Music Theatre Writing program on original new music theatre pieces. This will be conducive to students forging bonds with the composers and librettists who will be creating the music of their cultural moment. All courses will be taught with an emphasis on the music theatre as a collaborative holistic art form requiring proficiency in acting, music, and dance.
