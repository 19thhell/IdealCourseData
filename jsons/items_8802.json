It includes small perforations along its edges for the attachment of an inner lining, probably of leather or felt, that would have cushioned\u2014if only slightly\u2014against direct contact with the hard metal. The helmet has no decoration, no inscription, no relief work or applied ornament that might signify ritual or elite connotations: this is a functional Corinthian helmet pure and simple. It was originally unearthed with the cheekguards and nosepiece twisted upward, \u00a0a ritual practice meant to \u2018kill\u2019 the helmet before it was dedicated and later buried at a Pan-Hellenic temple, probably the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. \u00a0Though we know this much, we have no actual provenance for the helmet; it was most likely excavated in the nineteenth century expressly for the antiquities market, when the cheekguards and nosepiece were \u2018repaired\u2019 for sale\u2014basically bent back down\u2014and the nosepiece, having probably broken off during the \u2018reparation,\u2019 was replaced with a modern one artificially aged to match the helmet. \u00a0It then passed into the collection of the Charterhouse school in Surrey, either by bequest (most likely) or by purchase, and remained there until 2002, when it came up for auction at Sotheby\u2019s. \u00a0It subsequently entered the Manchester Museum\u2019s permanent collection \u00a0collection. \u00a0 Corinthian helmets at Olympia:                                                    No labels                                                       1 Child Page                                                       Page:     permanent collection                                                                                                                                                                                     Powered by Atlassian Confluence 5.6.6 , Team Collaboration Software      Printed by Atlassian Confluence 5.6.6, Team Collaboration Software.

It includes small perforations along its edges for the attachment of an inner lining, probably of leather or felt, that would have cushioned\u2014if only slightly\u2014against direct contact with the hard metal. The helmet has no decoration, no inscription, no relief work or applied ornament that might signify ritual or elite connotations: this is a functional Corinthian helmet pure and simple. It was originally unearthed with the cheekguards and nosepiece twisted upward, \u00a0a ritual practice meant to \u2018kill\u2019 the helmet before it was dedicated and later buried at a Pan-Hellenic temple, probably the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. \u00a0Though we know this much, we have no actual provenance for the helmet; it was most likely excavated in the nineteenth century expressly for the antiquities market, when the cheekguards and nosepiece were \u2018repaired\u2019 for sale\u2014basically bent back down\u2014and the nosepiece, having probably broken off during the \u2018reparation,\u2019 was replaced with a modern one artificially aged to match the helmet. \u00a0It then passed into the collection of the Charterhouse school in Surrey, either by bequest (most likely) or by purchase, and remained there until 2002, when it came up for auction at Sotheby\u2019s. \u00a0It subsequently entered the Manchester Museum\u2019s permanent collection \u00a0collection. \u00a0 Corinthian helmets at Olympia:                                                    No labels                                                       1 Child Page                                                       Page:     permanent collection                                                                                                                                                                                     Powered by Atlassian Confluence 5.6.6 , Team Collaboration Software      Printed by Atlassian Confluence 5.6.6, Team Collaboration Software.
