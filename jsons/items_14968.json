This is an important part of the economy, both in the US and worldwide. Marketing luxury products and services presents a number of unique challenges including the nature of the target market, importance of establishing a strong relationship with customers, the critical role of brand image, and the nature of the distribution system. This specialization offers a wide range of courses, including the Doing Business in Italy, which takes place in Milan during Spring Break and provides students with exposure to the high fashion and luxury industry in one of the fashion capitals of Europe.
