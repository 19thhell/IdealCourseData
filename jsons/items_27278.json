Launched in Fall 2008, the ACT-Institute is designed to explore concepts such as diversity, social justice, identity and inclusion particularly as they relate to the work administrators engage with students and colleagues. Participants will gain both insights and practical tools to inform their personal lens, which we believe will assist efforts to impact institutional, cultural and individual practices. Participants can be nominated to apply by colleagues or self-apply.    The Foundations seminar is the first in the series and serves as a required prerequisite in order to enroll in any of the other seminars. Foundations offers a broad overview of the complexities of diversity issues in higher education and provides common language and shared theoretical frameworks for analyzing these issues. Foundations will be offered twice: Friday, October 17, 2014, 1-4pm and Friday, November 7, 2014, 1-4pm. Participants need only attend ONE of these sessions. For professionals who attended Foundations last year, the prerequisite requirement has been met and they are therefore eligible to attend any of the subsequent seminars. However, pre-registration is always required for participation in ALL ACT-I seminars.    Content seminars will more closely examine selected areas of diversity and social justice in higher education and NYU specifically, with special attention given to the Global Network University. Lunch is provided at all ACT-I seminars. Selected seminars are scheduled for the these dates:       December 5, 2014, 1-4pm: Religion, Faith and Spirituality in Higher Education     January 30, 2015, 1-4pm: Race, Ethnicity and Culture at NYU and Beyond     February 20, 2015, 1-4pm: Socio-economic Diversity-Meeting the Opportunities and Challenges Through Student Affairs     March 7, 2015 1-4pm: Undocumented Students     March 27, 2015, 1-4pm: Gender and Sexuality in Colleges and Universities     April 3, 2015, 1-4pm: The Global/International Experience for Student and Professional     May 1, 2015, 1-4pm: The Wrap-Up, Best Practices and Practical Application **Mandatory for all those seeking certification**      The NYU Human Resources Department recognizes the ACT-Institute as a certified professional development training. New participants who complete the prerequisite Foundations &amp; Wrap-Up seminars and any three specialized seminars during the 2014-15 series will receive Basic Cultural Competency certification. For those new or returning participants who complete or have completed the prerequisite Foundations &amp; Wrap-Up seminar and at least five of the six selected content seminars during this or last year\u2019s series will receive a certificate from NYU Human Resources indicating completion of formal training requirements for Advanced Cultural Competency. Advanced Cultural Competency holders will also be recognized at the NIA Awards, sponsored by The Center for Multicultural Education and Programs and the Hallmark Awards sponsored by the Division of Student Affairs at NYU.    Space is limited to 45 participants so early registration is encouraged. Location of seminars will be given after notification of enrollment.

Everyone called him \"crazy\" I thought that was a lie, pure unadulterated bullshit and highly disrespectful. He saw things so differently. They took him away . I never saw him again. I started doing littler things to let him know that I had been listenig. I wouldn't eat. I demanded mango in the jello instead of pineapple. I wouldn't do chores and when I needed time alone to think, I acted a plum fool. I knew how to do just enough of whatever to make them put me away but not so drugged that I couldn't think or imagine. Charlie said my mind was the best gift in the world so hold on to it and keep it strong, flexible and willful.

Posted by Anja at 05:16 PM  | Comments (0)            On the Moon    Our residence on the moon  is completely sustainable.  If you look closely you can  see the glint of our reflective  solar panels just to the side  of Copernicus, if you squint.  In our hydroponic farm we grow  heirloom tomatoes of many  varieties: Oxheart, Dixie Golden  Giant, Yellow Brandywine, Mandarin  Cross, and Green Zebra, just to  name a few. We reuse everything  on the moon, but the food is  quite tasty. Nothing smells like  piss at mealtime. I'll confess  I'd kill for a tender sirloin  but we can do a lot of things  with legumes on the moon. We  get all of the channels on the  satellite, and what we can't  get there we download off the  internet. There is no such thing  as piracy on the moon. Many things  are legal on the moon. Harry and  Frank got married just last week  and we threw them a big party.  Well, a big party for the moon.  They get the same benefits as  everyone else on the moon. We  have a lot of cool robots and  plenty of time for our hobbies  and one cat who's a bit skittish  and a handball court in addition  to the elliptical trainer and the  treadmill here on the moon. Earth  rise is so beautiful, darling, though  the nights are very long on the  moon. Burn a fire tonight, if you can.  I'll try to spot it with the  telescope. I'll just pretend  if I can't. I miss you  here  on the moon.      Posted by Scott Rettberg at 03:38 PM  | Comments (0)            Learning Swedish 101     ...-gatan means \"street\". -S.    I have noticed that most of my unintentional creative acts have  been destructive acts of some sort, so I'll be taking a break for  a bit, trying to understand and learn the Swedish which surrounds  me... to return later and restore some balance in the world. -S.

Again, I am out of town, away from my normal materials and schedule. Right now I am making just to maintian the schedule - for the sake of discipline. However I will make up for this later with awesome fantastical maps that have been incubating while I do my research.

Posted by Jonathan Brodsky at 12:08 AM  | Comments (0)            Lonely Dog Project    It really bugs me when dog owners leave their dogs chained up outside a coffee shop while they enjoy an hour long brunch or a full thai sit-down dinner. I tend to think their dogs would be much happier at home, sleeping on a warm couch, rather than on the cold concrete.    For the last few months my husband I have been talking about making tags to attach to dogs' leashes when they're waiting for their owners outside of restaurants and stores in the freezing cold. I'd love to fully implement this project, but my concern is tagging a dog and it looking like I am trying to make off with someone's pooch.    In the meantime, here are some tag ideas:             Posted by superkb at 12:04 AM  | Comments (3)            Translation / Traducci\u00f3n V    This one has some crazy lines I won't forget soon. Strange to see what happens when translating a poem where the poet throws normal logic right out the window. Kinda makes you close your eyes and hold on for dear life. Keep reading past the jump for the full translation.    Walking Around  by Pablo Neruda    It happens that I'm tired of being a man.  It happens that I enter the tailor shops and the movie theatres  wilted, impenetrable, like a felt swan  navigating water of origin and ash.    The barbershops' odor makes me sob.  I just want to rest in rocks or in wool,  I just don't want to see establishments or gardens,  or markets, or binoculars, or elevators.    It happens that I'm tired of my feet and my toenails  and my hair and my shadow.  It happens that I'm tired of being a man.    Nevertheless, it would be delicious  to scare a notary with a cut lily  or deal death to a monk with a blow to the ear.  It would be beautiful  to walk the streets with a green knife  shouting until I die of cold.    I don't want to keep being a root in the darkness,  wish-washy, stretched out, trembling with tiredness,  down deep, in the wet guts of the earth,  absorbing and thinking, eating every day.

I was in the dairy/juice aisle and I walked past someone trying to get a pack of orange juice-boxes from the top shelf. The person was a little vertically challenged, so I stopped, asked if I could help, and pulled down an oj juice-box pack for the person. Nothing major - but it sure put a smile on the person's face when they saw me have a momentary bit of difficulty getting the juice box down too. :-)          Posted by Mohit SantRam at 11:58 PM  | Comments (2)            Float    Float    fixed some IE bugs, thanks i!

A slow zoom onto the upstairs window by the tree - Zuky's bedroom. The sky is suitably grey and moody, but it's still quite bright. There's snow on the ground, and it's cold.
