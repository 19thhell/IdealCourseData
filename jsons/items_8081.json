However, we find that majors with no prior experience in classical studies are usually best served by taking 12-14 courses, which enriches their language studies with work in history, art/archaeology, classical civilization and classical literature. These last two categories include various literary genres (epic, lyric, drama, novel, oratory, historiography), philosophy, religion, political thought, gender and sexuality studies, mythology, ancient mathematics and science. Students planning graduate studies also generally take at least 12-14 courses, with a special emphasis on advanced language work and small seminars (including Honors work) in the junior and senior years.

What do the titles mean?     Elementary Latin I or Elementary Greek I is the first half of the first year college introductory course sequence, offered each fall; Elementary Latin II or Elementary Greek II is the second half of the introductory sequence, offered each spring. Intermediate Latin I (prose, usually Cicero, Caesar, or Petronius) is the first half of the second year course, offered each fall; the sequence continues with Intermediate Latin II (poetry, usually Vergil), offered each spring. Intermediate Greek I (Plato) is the second year course, offered each fall; Intermediate Greek II (Homer) each spring. To fulfill NYU's foreign language requirement, College students must complete the Intermediate II course, that is, the spring term of the second or Intermediate  year of the language sequence. After completing the Intermediate sequence (or its equivalent), students take the third year or Advanced course, which they may take more than once (see below).

However, we find that majors with no prior experience in classical studies are usually best served by taking 12-14 courses, which enriches their language studies with work in history, art/archaeology, classical civilization and classical literature. These last two categories include various literary genres (epic, lyric, drama, novel, oratory, historiography), philosophy, religion, political thought, gender and sexuality studies, mythology, ancient mathematics and science. Students planning graduate studies also generally take at least 12-14 courses, with a special emphasis on advanced language work and small seminars (including Honors work) in the junior and senior years.

This course traces Greek history from the Greeks' earliest appearance to the advent of Alexander. The Greek World from Alexander to Augustus CLASS-UA 243 Identical to HIST-UA 243. Offered every other year. 4 points. Continuation of the history of ancient Greece from the age of Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C.E. until Emperor Augustus consolidated the Roman hold over the eastern Mediterranean in the first century B.C.E.

By the end of the fourth century B.C.E., Rome was master of Italy, and within another 150 years, it dominated almost all of the Mediterranean world. Then followed a century of unrest involving some of the most famous events and men\u2014Caesar, Pompey, and Cato\u2014in Western history. The course surveys this vital period with a modern research interpretation. History of the Roman Empire CLASS-UA 278 Identical to HIST-UA 206. Offered every other year. 4 points. In the spring of 44 B.C.E., Julius Caesar was murdered by a group of senators disgruntled with his monarchic ways. However, Caesar's adoptive son and heir, Gaius Octavius, was quickly on the scene, and over the course of the next half-century managed to establish himself as Rome's first emperor. About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity.

Art and Archaeology Ancient Art at Risk: Conservation, Ethics, and Cultural Property CLASS-UA 100 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. Examines the environmental, material, social, and political forces that put ancient art at risk, including exposure to natural elements, acid rain, pollution, dam building, tourism, urban development, armed conflict, looting, theft, and the illicit trade in antiquities. Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connoisseurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials. The Parthenon and Its Reception: From Antiquity to the Present CLASS-UA 150 Identical to ARTH-UA 150. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered, as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum.

This seminar explores the history and culture of Egypt's western oases, especially of Dakhleh Oasis. In the course of this month, as we travel physically around Dakhleh and Kharga and chronologically from deep prehistory to the advent of Christianity, we address issues of insularity and connectivity with respect to the Nile Valley, as well as the relationship between humans, technology, and the natural environment. Inhabitants of the oases always enjoyed a rather precarious existence, because of the difficulty of travel, the ever-present risk of salinization, hostile desert raiders, and general remoteness; thus, we are alerted to the ways in which the realities of living on an oasis provoked identifiable and to some degree recurrent cultural dynamics. The Archaeology of Egypt's Nile Valley CLASS-UA 9356 Prerequisites: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355) and Field Work in Egypt (CLASS-UA 9357). Offered in the spring. 4 points. In this traveling seminar, students leave Dakhleh Oasis for the Nile Valley to place what they have studied into a wider cultural context. During the course of the month, students visit temples, tombs, settlements, and other sites throughout Egypt, from Aswan to Alexandria. Seminar sessions and class presentations focus on themes related especially to Egypt's ever-evolving religious and funerary beliefs, as well as the complex, often multicultural, nature of Egyptian civic life at various periods. Field Work in Egypt CLASS-UA 9357 Prerequisite: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355). Offered in the spring. 4 points. This intensive course is largely field-based, with additional time spent processing, recording, and analyzing materials at the excavation house. Students are involved in almost every aspect of the archaeological field process. Specialists offer instruction in survey techniques, in the drafting of archaeological plans, and in the interpretation of ceramics and other highly indicative artifacts. As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce original research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds. In all cases, they are encouraged to formulate and test hypotheses. Once completed, independent projects are archived in the library for the use of all other archaeologists who work at Amheida. Research undertaken while at Dakhleh is facilitated by our online database, by collections stored on site, and by the dig house library.        Graduate Courses Open to Undergraduates Courses in classics offered in the Graduate School of Arts and Science are open to all undergraduates who have reached the required advanced level of Greek or Latin language instruction.
