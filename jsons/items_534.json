I have recently completed a book-length monograph on the history of the relationship between science and Christianity and am in the early stages of another on emotional life in modern consumerist societies.     Biography   I received my BA from NYU and my Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from the Graduate Center from the City University of New York (CUNY). My dissertation examined the history of curriculum in American science education in the context of changes in what constitutes science. I spent many years conducting qualitative school-based research in NYC public schools and I teach in both psychology and education departments. I am currently a member-in-training at The National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis (NPAP) and will begin seeing patients shortly.   Selected Publications   Ausch, R. (2000).
