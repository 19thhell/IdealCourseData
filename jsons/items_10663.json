New cells replenish the files of cells in the shootward direction and also in the opposite direction to form a root cap. The root cap consists of columella cells, which help sense gravity, and lateral root cap cells. The highly organized structure and optical clarity of the root permits live imaging of regeneration at high resolution. Remarkably, we can cut away the self-replenishing cells (stem cells) and the root will regenerate, re-specifying the columella, the QC, the lateral root cap and other cells (pictured below). The root can even regenerate these cells in mutants that lack stem cell activity. We are pursuing several questions in this system:   \u2022 What cells contribute to the newly regenerated root tip?  \u2022 What cues re-initiate patterning and establish new tissue borders and organ shape?  \u2022 How do developmental programs respond to injury signals?  \u2022 What signals support the stem cell behavior?   We have a high-resolution regeneration imaging system in which we can track regenerating roots at cellular resolution for several days. We have also developed single-cell RNA-Seq techniques for single regenerating cells that permit us to ask about their molecular trajectory during regeneration. In addition, we use genetics to test our models about re-organization in the root.
