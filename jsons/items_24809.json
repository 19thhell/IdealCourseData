Integrative models have been of particular interest to me, and I have worked with a number of useful intervention models and strategies. In my work with drug-addicted individuals, I have found identity theory and positive reinforcement strategies to be particularly compelling. On a policy level, I have made a case for the adoption of \u201cGradualism\u201d, a treatment paradigm that seeks to integrate the best of the harm reduction and abstinence-oriented approaches to create better treatments for addicted individuals.     As a psychotherapist, I have been practicing Schema Therapy, an approach that draws on the cognitive, behavioral, Gestalt, and psychodynamic traditions. The revitalization and incorporation of Gestalt therapy techniques, particularly chairwork, in a cognitive-behavioral context, has also been a central concern, and I am currently working on a project to re-introduce \u201cchairwork\u201d to the world of psychotherapy. Lastly, psychometrics and test development have been areas of interest as well.
