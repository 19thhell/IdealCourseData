The former method is a new type of Semi-Lagrangian method for solving the advection equation. Our strategy reduces the original PDE to a set of decoupled linear ODEs with constant coefficients. Additionally, we introduce a remapping strategy to periodically guarantee solution accuracy for a deformation problem. The proposed scheme yields nearly an exact solution for a rigid body motion with a smooth function that possesses vanishingly small higher derivatives and calculates the gradient of the advected function in a straightforward way. The proposed method is verified through several 2D classical benchmark problems.    The latter method was developed for the purpose of solving for multiscale plasma waves in a tokamak poloidal plane accurately with reasonable computational cost, but the proposed method can also be applicable to any multiscale wave problems. This method is established by combining the advantages of the finite element and spectral methods, so that important properties in the finite element method, such as the sparsity of the global matrix and the ease in satisfying the boundary conditions, are retained. The present scheme is applied to some illustrative 1D multiscale problems, and its accuracy improvement is demonstrated through comparisons with the conventional finite element method.                  top | contact webmaster"}, {"content": "Graduate Mathematics Courses         Graduate Courses in Mathematics  All mathematics course are worth 3 points per term (except Master's Thesis Research, G63.3881, a 2-point course).

Interface tracking methods         My research is in the area of numerical methods for partial differential equations, and my main interest is moving boundary problems. Interfaces or internal boundaries are present in many different applications, such as high frequency wave propagation, solidification and multiphase flows.  Another problem involving moving boundaries is that of fluid-structure  interactions, and I am currently also working on simulating a suspension  of flexible fibers immersed in a Newtonian fluid.      One type of numerical methods for moving interface problems are the so called interface tracking methods, that are developed to numerically describe and track such interfaces when they move, deform and interact as determined by the underlying physics. Initially, I worked with a front-tracking method and later a level-set method, coupled to a finite element discretization of the Navier-Stokes equation, to simulate multiphase flows. In my PhD thesis, I also developed a new interface tracking technique, the segment projection method. This method can be viewed as a compromise between the front-tracking and level-set methods. It relies on the partitioning of an interface into several parts. In the case of two dimensional calculations, the interfaces are curves in the plane. Each curve is described by a union of overlapping curve segments, where the segments are chosen such that they can be given as functions of one spatial variable. The segment functions are discretized using one-dimensional Eulerian grids in the x and y directions. Hence, the curve is explicitly discretized with points on the curve as in the front-tracking method, thereby keeping the lower dimensionality, but the discretization is Eulerian as in the level-set method. The Eulerian form makes it easier to handle topological changes as in the example of merging bubbles.     The first application of the segment projection method was the multiphase flow simulations that I had earlier applied both the front-tracking and the level-set methods to. In this context, also the segment projection method is integrated into a finite element approximation of the incompressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.  The segment projection method has also later been applied to front propagation in geometrical optics and to simulations of epitaxial growth (applicable to growth of thin films in semi conductor production). This work is done in collaboration with Bjrn Engquist,  and for the geometrical optics application also with Olof Runborg.  In both these applications, the Eulerian explicit discretization of the interfaces is exploited, as we solve partial differential equations on the moving front/interface.      Very frequently in moving interface problems, there are forces acting on the interfaces, such as surface tension forces, elastic forces etc. When using an interface tracking method to couple the interface dynamics to for example the fluid equations to be solved on the background grid, these forces with singular support must be discretized on that grid.  Motivated by this, I have been studying how singular forces and discontinuous  coefficients should be discretized. First, in connection to quadrature, as  motivated by a finite element discretizations, and later also regarding  finite difference discretizations of different differential equations.                 Dynamics of multiple interacting flexible fibers in Stokes flow            We have developed a numerical method for simulating slender flexible fibers suspended in fluids. This is work done in collaboration with M. Shelley.       Here are some snapshots from a simulation of 25 flexible fibers  in a shear flow. The fibers are colored by the tension in the  fibers.                  The understanding of the dynamics of such suspensions are fundamental to understanding many flows arising in physics, biology and engineering. Examples include fiber-reinforced composites, the dynamics and rheology of biological polymers and the motility of microscopic organisms. Such filaments often have aspect ratios of length to radius ranging from a few hundred to several thousand. Full discretizations of such thin objects in a 3D domain is very costly. The Reynolds numbers for the applications listed are however very low.      We consider a three-dimensional flow with multiple, interacting fibers and make explicit use of both the fact that we are considering Stokes flow, as well as of the slenderness of the fibers. The key points are that for Stokes flow, boundary integral methods can be employed to reduce the three-dimensional dynamics to the dynamics of the two-dimensional filament surfaces, and that using slender body asymptotics, this can be further reduced to the dynamics of the one-dimensional filament centerlines. The resulting intergral equations take into account the fluid-filament interaction as well as filament-filament interactions, as mediated by the fluid.      The filaments we are considering are inextensible and elastic. Replacing the force in the integral equation by an explicit expression based on the shape of the filament, using Euler-Bernoulli elasticity, yields a time-dependent integral equation for the motion of the filament centerline. This equation will include the filament tension, for which an equation can be derived by using the condition of inextensibility of the filament. The evolution of the system therefore, in each time step, requires the solution of an auxiliary integro-differential equation for the filament tension.    In our numerical algorithm, the filament centerlines are parameterized by arclength, and discretized uniformly. All derivatives are computed using second-order divided differences. Special quadrature rules have been developed to compute the necessary integrals. A second-order time-stepping scheme is used, with implicit treatment of high derivatives. A product integration method is applied to evaluate the integrals in the integral operators.    We place our filaments in a shear flow. In the non-dimensionalized equations, there are two physical parameters. One is the ratio of the radius to the length, and the other one  is a parameter Z that relates the characteristic fluid drag to the filament elasticity.  If one single straight filament is inserted in a plane shear flow at some angle to the x-axis, it will simply rotate around its center of mass. If we introduce a small perturbation to the filament, so that it is not exactly straight, there are two possible scenarios. Either, this perturbation will disappear with time, and the filament will stay straight. However, if the filament is under compression for some time, and if the value of Z is large enough, then a so called buckling occurs. As we increase Z, this buckling becomes more pronounced.    Next follows three short animations that show the fundamentals for this buckling, for a length to radius ration of 1000, for three different values of Z. In these animations, the filament has been colored with the line tension. The line tension changes from negative to positive, as the filament goes from being under compression to being under extension.           Each movie is approx. 700KBytes     Next animation is one of 25 interacting filaments, inserted into a oscillating background shear flow. We impose periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise (x) direction. The animation shows one period in time. (Filaments not colored by line-tension in this movie).
