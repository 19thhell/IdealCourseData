Whether you have been working for several years and are just now thinking about applying for your undergraduate degree, or seeking to enhance your resume with a targeted set of courses, NYU has options for you.     The School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) offers non-credit courses and bachelor degree programs that are geared towards non-traditional college applicants. SCPS is also just one of NYU's schools that offers graduate degree programs.   Only two schools/colleges at NYU allow students to complete a second bachelor's degree program. You may apply to the second bachelor's degree program in the College of Nursing by clicking here . You may apply to the second bachelor's degree program in the Polytechnic School of Engineering by clicking here .   The Postbaccalaureate Prehealth Studies Program allows students who earned a bachelor's degree in a field without a pre-medical or pre-health focus to complete the credits required for admission to U.S. medical schools.   The Dental Hygiene Programs through the NYU College of Dentistry allows students to earn an associate's degree or one of three bachelor's degree options: a didactic program, a four-year track, and a degree completion program for those who have already completed an approved dental hygiene program and wish to earn a bachelor's degree.       Of the options above, it is important to note that the Office of Undergraduate Admissions manages only the admissions process for the second bachelor's degree programs for the College of Nursing and the Polytechnic School of Engineering. For the other programs, please contact the appropriate departments directly.              Previously enrolled as a degree-seeking student at NYU?

Whether you have been working for several years and are just now thinking about applying for your undergraduate degree, or seeking to enhance your resume with a targeted set of courses, NYU has options for you.     The School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) offers non-credit courses and bachelor degree programs that are geared towards non-traditional college applicants. SCPS is also just one of NYU's schools that offers graduate degree programs.   Only two schools/colleges at NYU allow students to complete a second bachelor's degree program. You may apply to the second bachelor's degree program in the College of Nursing by clicking here . You may apply to the second bachelor's degree program in the Polytechnic School of Engineering by clicking here .   The Postbaccalaureate Prehealth Studies Program allows students who earned a bachelor's degree in a field without a pre-medical or pre-health focus to complete the credits required for admission to U.S. medical schools.   The Dental Hygiene Programs through the NYU College of Dentistry allows students to earn an associate's degree or one of three bachelor's degree options: a didactic program, a four-year track, and a degree completion program for those who have already completed an approved dental hygiene program and wish to earn a bachelor's degree.       Of the options above, it is important to note that the Office of Undergraduate Admissions manages only the admissions process for the second bachelor's degree programs for the College of Nursing and the Polytechnic School of Engineering. For the other programs, please contact the appropriate departments directly.              Previously enrolled as a degree-seeking student at NYU?

Visit the Singapore Group @ NYU Facebook group to get all your questions answered!   Foreword   Before anything else is said, note also that you have the choice of living off campus - it is likely to be much cheaper, and you will get more privacy than in the dorms, allowing you to sleep and study better (but you also need to consider other things like length of the lease or cost of utilities).   Basically, there are two kinds of dorms here in NYU &ndash; traditional-style and apartment-style. Traditional dorms include Brittany Hall, Founders Hall, Goddard Hall, Hayden Hall, Rubin Hall and Weinstein Hall. Apartment-styled dorms include Alumni Hall, Broome Street, Carlyle Court, Cliff Street, Coral Towers, Greenwich Hotel, Lafayette Street, Water Street, Palladium, University Hall, Third Avenue North, Twenty Sixth Street, among others. Not all are freshmen dorms; the allocation has been known to change.   Traditional vs. Apartment-style Dorms - What&rsquo;s the difference?   The main difference between the two is that in apartment-style dorms, kitchens are provided. Consequently, this leads to the rule that it is mandatory for all students living in traditional-styled dorms to enroll in a meal plan of at least 10 meals per week. This may be kind of nice at first, because certain dining halls (namely Weinstein and University Hall) have pretty good food, and most of them are all-you-can-eat style, which appeals to the kiasuness in every Singaporean. However, when you consider the fact that you pay on average US$8 for each meal, that you begin to put on weight like nobody&rsquo;s business, and that there are only so many cheeseburgers you can eat in a week before you get tired of it, being forced into a meal plan just because you live in a traditional dorm becomes pretty annoying.   Other than the presence of kitchen facilities and whether or not a meal plan is required, there aren&rsquo;t many other differences between the two. Traditional dorms typically have a smaller area because they don&rsquo;t have separate common spaces (like a living room) as apartment-style dorms do, so you may have less privacy in traditional dorms. However, as most freshmen live in traditional dorms, people there tend to be much more sociable and friendly, whereas people living in apartment-style dorms may not even know who their next door neighbors are. Both types of dorms do have programs for the residents to get to know their floors and the building better, and do allow for sufficient interaction through various hall programs for their residents.   Which dorms are the nearest to school, and which are the farthest?   Location is definitely one factor you should consider in picking dorms. NYU&rsquo;s campus is integrated into New York City, and its dorms are actually acquired buildings, and are therefore scattered throughout the city. You may think that just because you used to live in Boon Lay and had to travel 2 hours everyday to get to Tampines JC, you won&rsquo;t mind any kind of traveling. Well, wait till you have to make a half hour trek to school through 20 inches of snow and freezing wind that borders on turning into a hurricane. Or till you have to squeeze yourself onto an overcrowded NYU shuttle bus and have your face squashed against the window while the bus inches through NYC traffic.   Most classes that you&rsquo;ll take will be located on the east side of Washington Square, and the closest dorms are Weinstein, Goddard, Brittany and Hayden, all of which are within a few minutes&rsquo; walk. Other dorms like Alumni Hall, Palladium, University Hall, Third Avenue North, Rubin Hall, Founders Hall, Carlyle Court, and Coral Towers are also within a distance of a 15 minute walk.   Which dorms are nice? Which dorms resemble war-torn areas?   Some of us say that the niceness of an NYU dorm increases proportionately with the distance from school, which, as a rule of thumb, is generally true.   Water Street and Cliff Street are known to be rather posh, with huge rooms, and for some people, that makes up for the distance from school. The views from those buildings can be pretty breathtaking, if you live on the higher floors, and the area is safe, with lots of tourist attractions nearby. (Note however, that there are no freshmen living in these two dorms &ndash; only upperclassmen live there) Palladium and University Hall are relatively new buildings, and are also really nice. Palladium has a great gym with an indoor basketball court, and a swimming pool and a swimming pool as well. With a good dining hall (buffet style) and the added bonus of being near school, it is one of the most sought-after dorms.   The traditional dorms are mostly old buildings. Brittany and Rubin do not have air-conditioning, so it may get unbearably hot sometimes. However, it is said that the dorm to avoid at all costs is Twenty Sixth Street, because people have been known not to survive the semester living there. But it is also one of the cheapest NYU dorms, so you may want to think about living there if you would rather spend your money elsewhere, perhaps at the various strip clubs in NYC so that you won&rsquo;t even have to go back to your dorm at night.   What else should I consider?   If you will be getting a meal plan, it would be much more convenient for you to live in a dorm that houses a dining hall. Weinstein, Palladium and University Hall have dining halls which are pretty good. Rubin, Hayden and Third Avenue North also have dining halls, but they&rsquo;re smaller and have less variety. Do also consider that you may get a 5-meal plan or various flex plans so that you can also eat out or cook, which is cheaper than the average value of a 10 meal plan. Do note that only in apartment style buildings can you get smaller meal plans, and having the kitchen for cooking instant-noodles is really cheap and convenient.   Think about how many people you&rsquo;re comfortable with sharing a living space with. Generally speaking, try to avoid living in triple rooms, because you&rsquo;ll be literally lying on top of each other, and you&rsquo;ll get no personal space at all. Also, check out how many people there are living in a particular apartment suite, because you may be in a double room, but in a suite of 3 rooms, so you&rsquo;ll be sharing an apartment with 5 other people. It may be fun living with a lot of people, but the more people there are, the messier and noisier it will get. With regards to single rooms, it is normally difficult to get one unless you&rsquo;re a freshman or a senior, or have a medical problem; however, certain spoilt people I know have managed to get one through sheer perseverance. J   Some dorms, like Cliff Street and Water Street, don&rsquo;t have Ethernet connections or cable TV, so you will have to pay for those yourself if you&rsquo;re living in those dorms. Subscription to cable internet costs about US$40 a month, but you can split the connection with your roommate and share the cost. Splitting the connection is, of course, illegal and I am not saying that you should do that.   There is also a First Year Residential Experience (FYRE) Program going on that makes certain dorms exclusively freshman inhabited, and they frequently organize other program with the other freshman dorms. Getting into one of the freshmen dorms would be a good way to make friends and experience the more havoc kind of life. Of course you could also choose to shut yourself in your room and only ever see your roommate in the academic year, but that certainly defeats the purpose of dorm life.   Lastly, do realize that it&rsquo;s not true that you&rsquo;ll definitely get any dorm that you pick. Freshmen have first dibs on choice of dorms, but even then, there are quotas for the number of freshmen in any particular dorm, so you still may not get your first choice. The more years you live in NYU dorms, the more lottery points you will accumulate, so seniors will have priority over juniors and sophomores. Also, if you choose to room with friends, you and friends will have priority over those who aren&rsquo;t. All in all, you have to consider which dorm you&rsquo;d be likely to be able to get, before choosing.   Conclusion   There&rsquo;re a lot of factors you need to consider (if you want to live in a dorm) in choosing a dorm, so no one can tell you which dorm is best for you. You need to decide if you would rather live closer to school and in a smaller dorm room, or farther from school and in a marginally nicer dorm. However, many have been happier living off campus in spaces that are quieter, safer, more affordable, private, and in some cases, even closer to school - it's your choice."}]}]
