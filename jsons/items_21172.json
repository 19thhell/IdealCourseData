Professor Donnellan recently retired from a forty year career in Federal Service, thirty-seven of which were spent serving veterans in the Department of Veterans Affairs.\u00a0 In 1991 he was appointed as Director of the Manhattan VA Medical Center, and in 1999 he successfully integrated the Brooklyn, St. Albans (Queens) and Manhattan VA facilities into the newly formed VA New York Harbor Health Care System, providing a continuum of medical care to veterans in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.   Throughout his VA career Professor Donnellan served the Department of Veterans Affairs as a member of numerous national work groups and committees on VA Healthcare Policy.\u00a0 He also chaired the NY/NJ Veterans Healthcare Network Council for Geriatrics and Extended Care Services. In that capacity, he worked to improve home and community based services for veterans with chronic and palliative care needs. Additionally, he served the larger federal community in New York City as a member and Chairperson of the New York Federal Executive Board.\u00a0 For his leadership as a federal executive he was awarded the President's Distinguished Senior Executive Rank Award (1999) and the President's Meritorious Senior Executive Rank Award (1996, 2002, 2008).\u00a0   Professor Donnellan is a Fellow in the American College of Healthcare Executives. He has long been a preceptor for graduate students completing administrative residencies/fellowships in health care administration.\u00a0 In 1998 he was recognized by Veterans Health Administration with the \"Outstanding Preceptor Award\" for his contributions to administrative residents and fellows and to VA's Graduate Healthcare Administration Training Program.\u00a0 In 2001 he was recognized for his contributions to VA Nursing with the \"Secretary of Veterans Affairs Award for Advancement of Nursing Programs.\"   At Wagner, Professor Donnellan teaches the Health Policy and Management Capstone, Health Services Management and Ethics in Healthcare Management.

As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member. Projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills including project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment.       Download Syllabus             Fall 2014       EXEC-GP.2811.001   Continuous Quality Improvement for Healthcare Leaders            Only open to Executive MPA students.      This course is designed to explore the complex organizational mechanisms that need to be in place for the delivery of world-class service. While many organizations understand the importance of service, the ability to consistently deliver on this service often eludes them. This is especially true in healthcare organizations. Customer service is the end product, the outcome of a well-oiled machine that has the infrastructure, the staff, and the will to deliver on that service. It requires exquisite synergy among key organizational components: human resources - leveraging recruitment, selection, training, empowerment, coaching, recognition staff for service delivery; organization and systems design - implementation of an organizational structure that facilitates service delivery using customer-focused processes and systems; and the deliberate creation of a service culture that permeates all segments of the organization regardless of role, rank, or function in the organization.      This course will cover a broad range of service delivery topics including: defining service excellence, aligning core organizational and human resource systems for service delivery, seeing service from the customer\u2019s perspective, improving systems and service, service failure and recovery, and benchmarking best practices in world class service organizations.      In addition to providing you with an understanding of current issues in service excellence, a second objective of this course is to develop your skills in applying these concepts. To do this, business cases, classroom exercises and assignments will provide individuals and groups an opportunity to practice analyzing and solving actual service problems. It is my intention that you leave the course with an expanded toolkit that can be applied to your work contexts as well as being better informed about organizational dynamics that impact customer service.

Learning objectives include:      - Foster critical awareness of the student\u2019s values and the underlying ethical issues   - Identify and enhance knowledge and skills to respond to specific ethics encountered in today\u2019s environment   - Promote competence in moral reasoning and skill in applying basic ethics concepts, including identifying, analyzing, and resolving ethics conflicts   - Explore various ethical issues in health care management   - Describe ethics resources and tools      The course will focus on both recognizing and responding to contemporary ethical topics in health care management.      Class sessions will explore the application of moral   reasoning, based on various ethical theories to health care concerns encountered by healthcare administrators, policy makers and clinicians. The course will demonstrate the practical application of philosophy and specifically, moral reasoning to ethical conflicts in health care organizations. Emphasis will be on critical thinking, real-world   application, and decision-making in a professional environment.

Download Syllabus             Spring 2012       PADM-GP.4152.001   Ethical Issues in Public Service         Professionals working in Public Service are charged with serving the interests and protecting the rights of the   community. The issues confronting public service professionals are frequently complex, involving conflicting   values and strongly held preferences, incomplete and possibly unreliable information, and consequences that   no one can foresee. Effectively serving the common good, then, requires that public officials exercise sound   moral judgment in performing their duties \u2013 that their actions be defensible ethically as well as legally.   This highly interactive, inter-professional course is designed to give students an overview of ethical challenges   in public service, including recognizing and responding to contemporary conflicts in the public service   environment. The course is designed to enhance students\u2019 ability to think ethically about the means and ends   of public service. Students will become familiar with the application of ethics principles to today\u2019s ethics   challenges. Through the discussion of case studies, students will build practical ethical reasoning skills and   strategies for dealing with frequently encountered issues, as well as approaches for anticipating and   decreasing the presence of ethics conflicts. We will examine normative concepts and principles that typically   enter into moral reasoning and use these tools in analyzing actual cases.

A moral compass for management decision making: a healthcare CEO's reflections Frontiers of Health Services Management. 2013; 30(1): 14-26.    Abstract    Ethical behavior is good for business in any organization. In healthcare, it results in better patient care, a more committed and satisfied staff, more efficient care delivery, and increased market share. But it requires leaders who have a broad view of the role that ethics programs--and an effective, sustained ethical culture--play. Ethical organizations have integrated and shared ethical values and practices, an effective ethics infrastructure, ongoing ethics education for staff at every level, ethical and morally courageous leaders, and a culture that is consistent with the organization's values. The mission, vision, and values statements of these organizations have been successfully translated into a set of shared values--a moral compass that guides behavior and decision making.       2009      Nelson, W.A. & Donnellan J. 2009.

As regulators, public funders and private donors increasingly expect the organizations they support to operate with the highest standards, managers need to understand the risks and punishments for failing in this critical management function. This is especially true in the present climate where scandals in the public, nonprofit and for profit sectors have heightened awareness and expectations for transparent and competence management.      Using readings and case studies students will gain an understanding of the legal and regulatory environment of the nonprofit organization. They will learn how to design an agency corporate compliance program, write the policies and procedures of internalcontrols and the basics of risk management. Ethical behavior and creating an ethical corporate culture will be woven throughout the course content.    Prerequisites: None.

Professor Donnellan recently retired from a forty year career in Federal Service, thirty-seven of which were spent serving veterans in the Department of Veterans Affairs.\u00a0 In 1991 he was appointed as Director of the Manhattan VA Medical Center, and in 1999 he successfully integrated the Brooklyn, St. Albans (Queens) and Manhattan VA facilities into the newly formed VA New York Harbor Health Care System, providing a continuum of medical care to veterans in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.   Throughout his VA career Professor Donnellan served the Department of Veterans Affairs as a member of numerous national work groups and committees on VA Healthcare Policy.\u00a0 He also chaired the NY/NJ Veterans Healthcare Network Council for Geriatrics and Extended Care Services. In that capacity, he worked to improve home and community based services for veterans with chronic and palliative care needs.

As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member. Projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills including project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment.       Download Syllabus             Fall 2014       EXEC-GP.2811.001   Continuous Quality Improvement for Healthcare Leaders            Only open to Executive MPA students.      This course is designed to explore the complex organizational mechanisms that need to be in place for the delivery of world-class service. While many organizations understand the importance of service, the ability to consistently deliver on this service often eludes them. This is especially true in healthcare organizations. Customer service is the end product, the outcome of a well-oiled machine that has the infrastructure, the staff, and the will to deliver on that service. It requires exquisite synergy among key organizational components: human resources - leveraging recruitment, selection, training, empowerment, coaching, recognition staff for service delivery; organization and systems design - implementation of an organizational structure that facilitates service delivery using customer-focused processes and systems; and the deliberate creation of a service culture that permeates all segments of the organization regardless of role, rank, or function in the organization.      This course will cover a broad range of service delivery topics including: defining service excellence, aligning core organizational and human resource systems for service delivery, seeing service from the customer\u2019s perspective, improving systems and service, service failure and recovery, and benchmarking best practices in world class service organizations.      In addition to providing you with an understanding of current issues in service excellence, a second objective of this course is to develop your skills in applying these concepts. To do this, business cases, classroom exercises and assignments will provide individuals and groups an opportunity to practice analyzing and solving actual service problems. It is my intention that you leave the course with an expanded toolkit that can be applied to your work contexts as well as being better informed about organizational dynamics that impact customer service.

Download Syllabus             Spring 2012       PADM-GP.4152.001   Ethical Issues in Public Service         Professionals working in Public Service are charged with serving the interests and protecting the rights of the   community. The issues confronting public service professionals are frequently complex, involving conflicting   values and strongly held preferences, incomplete and possibly unreliable information, and consequences that   no one can foresee. Effectively serving the common good, then, requires that public officials exercise sound   moral judgment in performing their duties \u2013 that their actions be defensible ethically as well as legally.   This highly interactive, inter-professional course is designed to give students an overview of ethical challenges   in public service, including recognizing and responding to contemporary conflicts in the public service   environment. The course is designed to enhance students\u2019 ability to think ethically about the means and ends   of public service. Students will become familiar with the application of ethics principles to today\u2019s ethics   challenges. Through the discussion of case studies, students will build practical ethical reasoning skills and   strategies for dealing with frequently encountered issues, as well as approaches for anticipating and   decreasing the presence of ethics conflicts. We will examine normative concepts and principles that typically   enter into moral reasoning and use these tools in analyzing actual cases.       Download Syllabus             Spring 2012       PADM-GP.4142.001   Tools for Managing Nonprofits: Compliance, Internal Controls and Ethics         This class will prepare the future nonprofit manager to lead a legally compliant and ethical organization. As regulators, public funders and private donors increasingly expect the organizations they support to operate with the highest standards, managers need to understand the risks and punishments for failing in this critical management function. This is especially true in the present climate where scandals in the public, nonprofit and for profit sectors have heightened awareness and expectations for transparent and competence management.      Using readings and case studies students will gain an understanding of the legal and regulatory environment of the nonprofit organization. They will learn how to design an agency corporate compliance program, write the policies and procedures of internalcontrols and the basics of risk management. Ethical behavior and creating an ethical corporate culture will be woven throughout the course content.

A moral compass for management decision making: a healthcare CEO's reflections Frontiers of Health Services Management. 2013; 30(1): 14-26.    Abstract    Ethical behavior is good for business in any organization. In healthcare, it results in better patient care, a more committed and satisfied staff, more efficient care delivery, and increased market share. But it requires leaders who have a broad view of the role that ethics programs--and an effective, sustained ethical culture--play. Ethical organizations have integrated and shared ethical values and practices, an effective ethics infrastructure, ongoing ethics education for staff at every level, ethical and morally courageous leaders, and a culture that is consistent with the organization's values. The mission, vision, and values statements of these organizations have been successfully translated into a set of shared values--a moral compass that guides behavior and decision making.       2009      Nelson, W.A. & Donnellan J. 2009.
