The Dental Hygiene programs at NYU College of Dentistry provide extraordinary clinical and academic opportunities for students interested in preventive oral healthcare and the promotion of good health. A key member of the healthcare team, the dental hygienist works together with the dentist to meet the oral health needs of patients and thereby improve patients' quality of life.   The Office of Allied Health Programs houses two degree programs, both of which prepare students for careers in dental hygiene: Bachelor of Science (BS) in Dental Hygiene and Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Dental Hygiene .   EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND MISSION   The mission of the New York University Dental Hygiene Programs is to partner with students to achieve academic excellence; promote scholarly activity, health promotion, disease prevention and research; to participate in community service; and to offer comprehensive client care, utilizing critical thinking and evidence-based decision making. As goals, the program will prepare a competent dental hygienist, maintain a contemporary dental hygiene program that reflects relevant and current dental hygiene practice, and provide an interdisciplinary integrated curriculum.   The NYU Advantage   Attending the only dental hygiene program housed within a dental college in the state of New York, Dental Hygiene students at the NYU College of Dentistry have the unique opportunity to work in integrated clinical settings alongside DDS students as well as faculty members from dental hygiene, dentistry and specialty areas -- gaining invaluable experiences as they learn the practice of dental hygiene while treating a highly diverse patient population. Academic excellence and clinical expertise are further supported by rotations through specialty areas (orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, implant dentistry, and pediatric dentistry), preparing students through a comprehensive and challenging education.

Anesthesiologist assistants perform many of the procedures normally associated with anesthesiologists: preoperative procedures such as the insertion of arterial and intravenous catheters; drug administration for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia; support therapy with intravenous fluids and cardiovascular drugs; adjustment of anesthetic levels on a minute-by-minute basis; recovery room and intensive care unit and pain clinic care; and sometimes a variety of administrative and educational activities. Students graduate from an Anesthesiologist's Assistant program with either a M.S. degree or a M.M.Sc. degree. REQUIREMENTS : Applicants to Anesthesiologist's Assistant programs must have completed an undergraduate premedical program and have a bachelor's degree typically with a major in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, or computer science. Alternatively, they may have a bachelor's degree in nursing. Candidates must take the GRE general test; at Emory University the MCAT is being phased in as a requirement along with, but not replacing, the GRE. Candidates, therefore, would be well served by taking both tests. PROGRAMS : As of January 2008, there are five accredited Anesthesiologist's Assistant programs in the United States: Emory University (Atlanta, Georgia), Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, Ohio), South University (Savannah, Georgia), Nova Southeastern Univeristy (Ft. Lauderdale, Florida), and University of Missouri (Kansas City, Missouri). The contact information for two of the programs is as follows: Case Western Reserve University Anesthesiologist's Assistant Program 1100 Euclid Ave. LKSD 2532 Cleveland, OH 44106-5007 Tel: (216) 844-8077 http://www.anesthesiaprogram.com/  Emory University MMSc Program in Anesthesiology Emory School of Medicine 57 Executive Park South, Suite 300 Atlanta, GA 30329 Tel: (404) 727-5910 http://www.emoryaaprogram.org/  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION : American Academy of Anesthesiologist Assistants P.O.

Students who are attracted to the health professions because they are particularly interested in the art of healing might want to give serious thought to nursing. Nurses provide direct care to people of all ages and in a variety of settings. Nursing care includes health promotion activities such as nutrition; immunization or baby care information; disease prevention such as blood pressure screening; acute care, including first aid and CPR; and rehabilitative care. With the changes taking place in the medical profession the opportunities open for motivated and ambitious nurses are many. Clearly there are many similarities between the work performed by nurses and M.D.s. Nursing combined with a specialty (e.g., nurse-anesthetist) or nurse-practitioner are longer-term goals where autonomy and flexibility are making this area exceptionally attractive. The employment opportunities are excellent; there is a shortage of nurses. Salaries have increased dramatically in the past several years, the types of settings in which nurses work are endless, and hours and conditions are extremely flexible. While it is possible to enter directly into a B.S.N. degree program from high school, there are well over 100 accelerated nursing programs of 12-18 months designed specifically for people who have earned B.A.s in other areas. At NYU, there is a 15-month program leading to the B.S.N. degree and R.N. certification. The NYU Division of Nursing also offers the Dual Degree B.S./M.A. Program for students interested in becoming a Nurse Practitioner. At schools without an accelerated program, you would generally apply as a transfer student, receive transfer credit for the required science and liberal arts courses, and then proceed with the nursing sequences. Nursing schools vary widely in how they treat college graduates, so you should check with the schools in which you are interested. REQUIREMENTS : For college graduates: A grade point average of 3.0 or above; postbaccalaureate science courses of above 3.0. \u00b7 Introduction to Modern Chemistry (1 semester) \u00b7 Principles of Organic Chemistry (1 semester) \u00b7 Human Anatomy and Physiology (1 semester) \u00b7 Microbiology (1 semester) \u00b7 Statistics (1 semester) \u00b7 Nutrition (1 semester) \u00b7 Developmental Psychology (1 semester) NYU REQUIREMENTS : NYU's program does not require the GRE. Its course requirements are similar to the above except that Organic Chemistry need not be taken and one semester of Anatomy and Physiology is sufficient if taken in a Nursing department.

They are trained to promote birth without modern intervention practices, but when necessary utilize modern medical technology. Nurse-midwives consider childbirth to be a natural process and seek to provide a complete--both physiological and psychological--approach to care. Greater numbers of women are choosing nurse-midwives for their maternity care because they appreciate this holistic approach. Midwives traditionally spend more time with their patients throughout both prenatal care and the labor process. This practice allows a stronger relationship to be built between the midwife and the patient and for the patient to continue learning about the process through her provider. Beyond the range of maternity care, nurse-midwives also provide well-woman gynecological care on an ongoing basis and have the independence to work closely with their patients and their families to provide the best possible care. Nurse-midwives practice in a variety of settings from freestanding birthing centers to community and hospital-based clinics. In addition to being a practicing midwife, there are possibilities of doing clinical research, teaching at a university, or promoting legislation and health care reform. Certified nurse-midwives are educated in both nursing and midwifery. In order to become a C.N.M., you must first earn the certification of R.N. This is followed by additional study in midwifery, which may take the form of a certificate program or the master's degree. The certificate program usually entails 9-12 months of study while the master's program is usually of 16-24 months duration. Many programs require additional clinical experience. There are a few programs that have a three-year curriculum in which the R.N. is earned in the first year and the remaining time is spent on midwifery. On completing any of the above midwifery programs, you are eligible to sit for the national midwifery exam. Nurse-midwives are licensed in all 50 states. REQUIREMENTS : The master's programs usually require the results of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE).

Osteopathic medicine is a distinctive form of medical practice that provides all of the benefits of modern medicine including prescription drugs, surgery, and the use of technology to diagnose disease and evaluate injury. It also offers the added benefit of hands-on diagnosis and treatment through a system of therapy known as osteopathic manipulative medicine. Osteopathic Medicine focuses on health education, injury prevention, and disease prevention. Osteopathic medical students are often strongly urged to go into primary-care areas (including General and Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics/Gynecology), so students drawn to these areas may find that osteopathy is ultimately their best option. In many areas outside of metropolitan areas (where there often is a big concentration of medical centers and physicians), D.O.s and M.D.s often work side by side and in the same hospitals. In some states, there is only one licensing agency for both M.D.s and D.O.s. As of June 2011, there were 27 osteopathic medical schools in the U.S. REQUIREMENTS : The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is required. Additionally, schools of osteopathic medicine evaluate letters of recommendation, leadership qualities, and participation in both academic and non-academic extracurricular activities. It is becoming increasingly important that you have considerable, direct experience under the tutelage of a D.O. Undergraduate pre-osteopathic medical study requires the following courses: \u00b7 General/Inorganic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 English and Writing (2 semesters) Some schools may have additional required or recommended courses, such as Biochemistry. You should consult The Osteopathic Medical College Information Book. It is updated annually, and a copy is kept on reserve in Silver 901.

Students who are interested in the field of medicine should be prepared to work independently, as part of a healthcare team, or as a paid employee under the direction of the administrator of an HMO. Those of you who follow healthcare issues in the newspapers know that students are choosing to go into M.D. programs, despite strong indications that their life in the field will by no means be as independent, affluent, or stable as were the careers of the earlier generation of physicians. REQUIREMENTS : Students are most strongly encouraged to establish a track record of long-term commitment to the health professions through volunteer work over a sustained period of semesters and years. Students must also take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Since students must have a B.A. or B.S. to go on to medical school, they must not only take the prerequisite courses but also do very well in terms of grades both in the sciences and in non-sciences. Undergraduate premedical study requires at least the following courses: \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 General Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 English and Writing (2 semesters) Some schools may require one or two semesters of college math or a course in biochemistry. Please consult this website under the \"prehealth courses\" tab for a listing of all medical schools with math and/or biochemistry requirements. Also consult the Medical School Admissions Requirements (\"MSAR\") book, which is updated annually. A copy is available in Silver 901 for reference.

Naturopathic physicians are primary-care physicians in the states in which they are licensed. In their 4-year curriculum, N.D.s take the same basic science courses as their allopathic and osteopathic counterparts, and they also receive training in fields such as Nutrition, Homeopathy, Botanical Medicine, Acupuncture, Counseling, Hydrotherapy, Naturopathic Manipulative Therapy, Pharmacology, and Minor Surgery. REQUIREMENTS : Required courses include a year each of General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biology, and Physics. Some schools may also require Math and Psychology courses. Recommended courses may include Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Botany, and Developmental Psychology.

PAs make clinical decisions and provide a broad range of diagnostic, therapeutic, preventive, and health maintenance services. PAs work in primary and specialty care in medical and surgical practice settings. PA practice may also be involved in educational, research, and administrative activities. There are over 130 accredited PA programs (for complete list see American Academy of Physician Assistants website below). The typical program is 24-25 months long and requires at least 2 years of college and some healthcare experience prior to admission. REQUIREMENTS : Requirements for PA programs tend to vary, so check with the individual programs you are interested in for specific requirements.

The Dental Hygiene programs at NYU College of Dentistry provide extraordinary clinical and academic opportunities for students interested in preventive oral healthcare and the promotion of good health. A key member of the healthcare team, the dental hygienist works together with the dentist to meet the oral health needs of patients and thereby improve patients' quality of life.   The Office of Allied Health Programs houses two degree programs, both of which prepare students for careers in dental hygiene: Bachelor of Science (BS) in Dental Hygiene and Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Dental Hygiene .   EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND MISSION   The mission of the New York University Dental Hygiene Programs is to partner with students to achieve academic excellence; promote scholarly activity, health promotion, disease prevention and research; to participate in community service; and to offer comprehensive client care, utilizing critical thinking and evidence-based decision making. As goals, the program will prepare a competent dental hygienist, maintain a contemporary dental hygiene program that reflects relevant and current dental hygiene practice, and provide an interdisciplinary integrated curriculum.   The NYU Advantage   Attending the only dental hygiene program housed within a dental college in the state of New York, Dental Hygiene students at the NYU College of Dentistry have the unique opportunity to work in integrated clinical settings alongside DDS students as well as faculty members from dental hygiene, dentistry and specialty areas -- gaining invaluable experiences as they learn the practice of dental hygiene while treating a highly diverse patient population. Academic excellence and clinical expertise are further supported by rotations through specialty areas (orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, implant dentistry, and pediatric dentistry), preparing students through a comprehensive and challenging education.

Anesthesiologist assistants perform many of the procedures normally associated with anesthesiologists: preoperative procedures such as the insertion of arterial and intravenous catheters; drug administration for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia; support therapy with intravenous fluids and cardiovascular drugs; adjustment of anesthetic levels on a minute-by-minute basis; recovery room and intensive care unit and pain clinic care; and sometimes a variety of administrative and educational activities. Students graduate from an Anesthesiologist's Assistant program with either a M.S. degree or a M.M.Sc. degree. REQUIREMENTS : Applicants to Anesthesiologist's Assistant programs must have completed an undergraduate premedical program and have a bachelor's degree typically with a major in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, or computer science. Alternatively, they may have a bachelor's degree in nursing. Candidates must take the GRE general test; at Emory University the MCAT is being phased in as a requirement along with, but not replacing, the GRE. Candidates, therefore, would be well served by taking both tests. PROGRAMS : As of January 2008, there are five accredited Anesthesiologist's Assistant programs in the United States: Emory University (Atlanta, Georgia), Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, Ohio), South University (Savannah, Georgia), Nova Southeastern Univeristy (Ft. Lauderdale, Florida), and University of Missouri (Kansas City, Missouri). The contact information for two of the programs is as follows: Case Western Reserve University Anesthesiologist's Assistant Program 1100 Euclid Ave. LKSD 2532 Cleveland, OH 44106-5007 Tel: (216) 844-8077 http://www.anesthesiaprogram.com/  Emory University MMSc Program in Anesthesiology Emory School of Medicine 57 Executive Park South, Suite 300 Atlanta, GA 30329 Tel: (404) 727-5910 http://www.emoryaaprogram.org/  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION : American Academy of Anesthesiologist Assistants P.O.

Students who are attracted to the health professions because they are particularly interested in the art of healing might want to give serious thought to nursing. Nurses provide direct care to people of all ages and in a variety of settings. Nursing care includes health promotion activities such as nutrition; immunization or baby care information; disease prevention such as blood pressure screening; acute care, including first aid and CPR; and rehabilitative care. With the changes taking place in the medical profession the opportunities open for motivated and ambitious nurses are many. Clearly there are many similarities between the work performed by nurses and M.D.s. Nursing combined with a specialty (e.g., nurse-anesthetist) or nurse-practitioner are longer-term goals where autonomy and flexibility are making this area exceptionally attractive. The employment opportunities are excellent; there is a shortage of nurses. Salaries have increased dramatically in the past several years, the types of settings in which nurses work are endless, and hours and conditions are extremely flexible. While it is possible to enter directly into a B.S.N. degree program from high school, there are well over 100 accelerated nursing programs of 12-18 months designed specifically for people who have earned B.A.s in other areas. At NYU, there is a 15-month program leading to the B.S.N. degree and R.N. certification. The NYU Division of Nursing also offers the Dual Degree B.S./M.A. Program for students interested in becoming a Nurse Practitioner. At schools without an accelerated program, you would generally apply as a transfer student, receive transfer credit for the required science and liberal arts courses, and then proceed with the nursing sequences. Nursing schools vary widely in how they treat college graduates, so you should check with the schools in which you are interested. REQUIREMENTS : For college graduates: A grade point average of 3.0 or above; postbaccalaureate science courses of above 3.0. \u00b7 Introduction to Modern Chemistry (1 semester) \u00b7 Principles of Organic Chemistry (1 semester) \u00b7 Human Anatomy and Physiology (1 semester) \u00b7 Microbiology (1 semester) \u00b7 Statistics (1 semester) \u00b7 Nutrition (1 semester) \u00b7 Developmental Psychology (1 semester) NYU REQUIREMENTS : NYU's program does not require the GRE. Its course requirements are similar to the above except that Organic Chemistry need not be taken and one semester of Anatomy and Physiology is sufficient if taken in a Nursing department.

They are trained to promote birth without modern intervention practices, but when necessary utilize modern medical technology. Nurse-midwives consider childbirth to be a natural process and seek to provide a complete--both physiological and psychological--approach to care. Greater numbers of women are choosing nurse-midwives for their maternity care because they appreciate this holistic approach. Midwives traditionally spend more time with their patients throughout both prenatal care and the labor process. This practice allows a stronger relationship to be built between the midwife and the patient and for the patient to continue learning about the process through her provider. Beyond the range of maternity care, nurse-midwives also provide well-woman gynecological care on an ongoing basis and have the independence to work closely with their patients and their families to provide the best possible care. Nurse-midwives practice in a variety of settings from freestanding birthing centers to community and hospital-based clinics. In addition to being a practicing midwife, there are possibilities of doing clinical research, teaching at a university, or promoting legislation and health care reform. Certified nurse-midwives are educated in both nursing and midwifery. In order to become a C.N.M., you must first earn the certification of R.N. This is followed by additional study in midwifery, which may take the form of a certificate program or the master's degree. The certificate program usually entails 9-12 months of study while the master's program is usually of 16-24 months duration. Many programs require additional clinical experience. There are a few programs that have a three-year curriculum in which the R.N. is earned in the first year and the remaining time is spent on midwifery. On completing any of the above midwifery programs, you are eligible to sit for the national midwifery exam. Nurse-midwives are licensed in all 50 states. REQUIREMENTS : The master's programs usually require the results of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION : American College of Nurse-Midwives 8403 Colesville Road, Suite 1550 Silver Spring, MD 20910 Tel: (240) 485-1800 http://www.midwife.org/          Osteopathic Physician (DO)                (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine)  There are a few slight differences between allopathic physicians and osteopathic physicians. Osteopathic medicine is a distinctive form of medical practice that provides all of the benefits of modern medicine including prescription drugs, surgery, and the use of technology to diagnose disease and evaluate injury. It also offers the added benefit of hands-on diagnosis and treatment through a system of therapy known as osteopathic manipulative medicine. Osteopathic Medicine focuses on health education, injury prevention, and disease prevention. Osteopathic medical students are often strongly urged to go into primary-care areas (including General and Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics/Gynecology), so students drawn to these areas may find that osteopathy is ultimately their best option. In many areas outside of metropolitan areas (where there often is a big concentration of medical centers and physicians), D.O.s and M.D.s often work side by side and in the same hospitals. In some states, there is only one licensing agency for both M.D.s and D.O.s. As of June 2011, there were 27 osteopathic medical schools in the U.S. REQUIREMENTS : The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is required. Additionally, schools of osteopathic medicine evaluate letters of recommendation, leadership qualities, and participation in both academic and non-academic extracurricular activities. It is becoming increasingly important that you have considerable, direct experience under the tutelage of a D.O. Undergraduate pre-osteopathic medical study requires the following courses: \u00b7 General/Inorganic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 English and Writing (2 semesters) Some schools may have additional required or recommended courses, such as Biochemistry. You should consult The Osteopathic Medical College Information Book. It is updated annually, and a copy is kept on reserve in Silver 901.

Students who are interested in the field of medicine should be prepared to work independently, as part of a healthcare team, or as a paid employee under the direction of the administrator of an HMO. Those of you who follow healthcare issues in the newspapers know that students are choosing to go into M.D. programs, despite strong indications that their life in the field will by no means be as independent, affluent, or stable as were the careers of the earlier generation of physicians. REQUIREMENTS : Students are most strongly encouraged to establish a track record of long-term commitment to the health professions through volunteer work over a sustained period of semesters and years. Students must also take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Since students must have a B.A. or B.S. to go on to medical school, they must not only take the prerequisite courses but also do very well in terms of grades both in the sciences and in non-sciences. Undergraduate premedical study requires at least the following courses: \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 General Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 English and Writing (2 semesters) Some schools may require one or two semesters of college math or a course in biochemistry. Please consult this website under the \"prehealth courses\" tab for a listing of all medical schools with math and/or biochemistry requirements. Also consult the Medical School Admissions Requirements (\"MSAR\") book, which is updated annually. A copy is available in Silver 901 for reference.
