In 1837, six years after the granting of the first University charter, the minutes of the meetings of the University Council contained the names of men suggested as professors for the chief branches of medical instruction.   In 1841, the University Medical College was organized, and instruction was begun under the following: Surgery, Anatomy; Chemistry; Theory and Practice of Medicine; Institutes of Medicine and Materia Medical; Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children.   Clinical instruction was started in Bellevue Hospital in 1847, and in 1861 Bellevue Hospital Medical College was founded when a college building was erected on the hospital grounds.   With the passing of the years and a deepening conviction that the total medical enterprise should be placed in the scholarly setting of the University, it became clear that University Medical College and Bellevue Hospital Medical College would benefit by consolidating. Thus, the medical school became an integral part of New York University in 1898 under the name of University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College. In 1935 the name was changed to New York University College of Medicine and in 1960 to NYU School of Medicine. The School of Medicine celebrated its sesquicentennial year in 1991.   Today the Medical School boasts 1,360 Full-Time faculty and 2,175 Part-Time faculty.

In 1837, six years after the granting of the first University charter, the minutes of the meetings of the University Council contained the names of men suggested as professors for the chief branches of medical instruction.       In 1841, the Medical College of New York University was organized, and admitted its first class of 239 students to a four month course of lectures conducted by the six professors on the faculty.     The 1841 faculty consisted of:  Professor Valentine Mott, Surgery   Professor John W. Draper, Chemistry   Professor Granville S. Pattison, Anatomy   Professor Gunning S. Bedford, Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children   Professor John Revere, Theory and Practice of Medicine     Professor Martyn Paine, Institutes of Medicine and Materia Medical         Clinical instruction\u00a0began in Bellevue Hospital in 1847.\u00a0 In 1861, Bellevue Hospital Medical College was founded and a college building was erected on the hospital grounds.       The Bellevue Hospital Medical College merged with University Medical College of New York University to form the University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1898. The combined institutions became the New York University College of Medicine in 1935.\u00a0 In 1960, the name was changed to the New York University School of Medicine.       The faculty of the Medical College, particularly Drs. John W. Draper and Martyn Paine, is largely responsible for the passing of 1854 legislation known as \"The Bone Bill\" in New York State, legalizing the dissection of the human body.     Notes on 19th Century Medical Education   In the 1850\u2019s, in order to graduate from NYU, students had to be at least 21 years old, have studied medicine for three years under the direction of a \"respectable medical practitioner\", have attended two medical lectures, one of which had to be at NYU, and write a thesis. At this time, it was not unusual for a physician to have degrees from two different medical schools.
