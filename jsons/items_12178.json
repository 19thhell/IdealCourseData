This long-term research project, funded by the National Science Foundation , the Partner University Fund and several other agencies saw the excavation of a large Aurignacian living surface and the meticulous recovery and dating of some of the oldest remains of symbolic behavior in Europe. Our work at Abri Castanet resulted in the discovery of a large portion of the collapsed shelter ceiling bearing engraved and painted imagery, sitting directly on a well preserved archaeological layer containing complex fireplace structures that were the focal point for human activities at the site. In 2011-2012, excavations at Abri Blanchard, probably the richest Aurignacian site ever to be excavated, yielded intact in situ deposits containing one of the most stunning Aurignacian engravings discovered to date with dates of ca. 35 000 BP. In light of our discoveries at Castanet and Blanchard, I have launched a new study of all of the known Aurignacian engraved blocks from SW France in collaboration with my Toulouse colleague Rapha\u00eblle Bourrillon. Intact Aurignacian deposits at Abri Blanchard, France \u00a9 R. White In parallel, I have in press a major article on 13 years of work on the 37,000-year-old Aurignacian personal ornaments from the French site of Brassempouy. This excavation is now concluded and we are able to make some clear observations on the spatial organization of bead/ornament production and use. A remarkable feature of the ornaments from Brassempouy is the presence of several pierced human teeth. \u2028My long-term study of the 40-35,000 year-old personal ornaments from the site of Isturitz in French Basque country continues. These ornaments, most of which are contemporary to or older than those from Brassempouy and Castanet, indicate striking social boundaries between these two sites, just 60 km apart. Personal ornamentation seems one of the key means by which Aurignacian regional groups constructed and communicated intra-group and regional identities. Among the most interesting finds at Isturitz is the on-site production of sensational amber ornaments in the form of lustrous beads and pendants dating to 40 000 years ago. \u2028 Longstanding research on Paleolithic female figurines continues to occupy part of my time. In 2008 I was commissioned by the French government to analyze a remarkable new 25,000-year-old statuette from Brassempouy, recovered from the backdirt of clandestine excavations at the site in 1977 and hidden from view until 2005. Based on my report, this important object has now been acquired by Mus\u00e9e d'Arch\u00e9ologie Nationale at Saint Germain-en-Laye. A published version will appear in the near future in the journal Pal\u00e9o . The 25,000 year-old \"woman with the horn\" from Laussel, Dordogne (\u00a9 Alain Roussot, with permission)                           A long-term project on the early twentieth-century history of French archaeology continues. I have had the good fortune to discover several entirely unknown archives related to the \u201cHauser Affair.\u201d Otto Hauser was a very ambitious German-Swiss archaeologist who was forced to flee France at the outset of World War I under a cloud of accusations of espionage and artifact selling. Far from being of mere local interest, the \u201caffaire Hauser\u201d took place against a backdrop of European history, politics, and administrative entanglements. For example, Hauser was allied with members of the anti-clerical movement at a time when considerable power in archaeology was held by Catholic lay priests. \u2028Contrary to received wisdom, Hauser is revealed by archival sources and photographs to have been a remarkable excavator, well ahead of his time. A first book on this subject, L\u2019Affaire de l\u2019abri du Poisson : Patrie et pr\u00e9histoire (P\u00e9rigueux: Fanlac), appeared in late 2006 and I am currently pursuing work on a second book on this complex and controversial subject. Finally, I have just had the honor of being appointed by the Faculty of Arts and Science as Director of the UMI 3199, the CNRS-NYU Center for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences (CIRHUS) .

This long-term research project, funded by the National Science Foundation , the Partner University Fund and several other agencies saw the excavation of a large Aurignacian living surface and the meticulous recovery and dating of some of the oldest remains of symbolic behavior in Europe. Our work at Abri Castanet resulted in the discovery of a large portion of the collapsed shelter ceiling bearing engraved and painted imagery, sitting directly on a well preserved archaeological layer containing complex fireplace structures that were the focal point for human activities at the site. In 2011-2012, excavations at Abri Blanchard, probably the richest Aurignacian site ever to be excavated, yielded intact in situ deposits containing one of the most stunning Aurignacian engravings discovered to date with dates of ca. 35 000 BP. In light of our discoveries at Castanet and Blanchard, I have launched a new study of all of the known Aurignacian engraved blocks from SW France in collaboration with my Toulouse colleague Rapha\u00eblle Bourrillon. Intact Aurignacian deposits at Abri Blanchard, France \u00a9 R. White In parallel, I have in press a major article on 13 years of work on the 37,000-year-old Aurignacian personal ornaments from the French site of Brassempouy. This excavation is now concluded and we are able to make some clear observations on the spatial organization of bead/ornament production and use. A remarkable feature of the ornaments from Brassempouy is the presence of several pierced human teeth. \u2028My long-term study of the 40-35,000 year-old personal ornaments from the site of Isturitz in French Basque country continues. These ornaments, most of which are contemporary to or older than those from Brassempouy and Castanet, indicate striking social boundaries between these two sites, just 60 km apart. Personal ornamentation seems one of the key means by which Aurignacian regional groups constructed and communicated intra-group and regional identities. Among the most interesting finds at Isturitz is the on-site production of sensational amber ornaments in the form of lustrous beads and pendants dating to 40 000 years ago. \u2028 Longstanding research on Paleolithic female figurines continues to occupy part of my time. In 2008 I was commissioned by the French government to analyze a remarkable new 25,000-year-old statuette from Brassempouy, recovered from the backdirt of clandestine excavations at the site in 1977 and hidden from view until 2005. Based on my report, this important object has now been acquired by Mus\u00e9e d'Arch\u00e9ologie Nationale at Saint Germain-en-Laye. A published version will appear in the near future in the journal Pal\u00e9o . The 25,000 year-old \"woman with the horn\" from Laussel, Dordogne (\u00a9 Alain Roussot, with permission)                           A long-term project on the early twentieth-century history of French archaeology continues. I have had the good fortune to discover several entirely unknown archives related to the \u201cHauser Affair.\u201d Otto Hauser was a very ambitious German-Swiss archaeologist who was forced to flee France at the outset of World War I under a cloud of accusations of espionage and artifact selling. Far from being of mere local interest, the \u201caffaire Hauser\u201d took place against a backdrop of European history, politics, and administrative entanglements. For example, Hauser was allied with members of the anti-clerical movement at a time when considerable power in archaeology was held by Catholic lay priests. \u2028Contrary to received wisdom, Hauser is revealed by archival sources and photographs to have been a remarkable excavator, well ahead of his time. A first book on this subject, L\u2019Affaire de l\u2019abri du Poisson : Patrie et pr\u00e9histoire (P\u00e9rigueux: Fanlac), appeared in late 2006 and I am currently pursuing work on a second book on this complex and controversial subject. Finally, I have just had the honor of being appointed by the Faculty of Arts and Science as Director of the UMI 3199, the CNRS-NYU Center for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences (CIRHUS) .
