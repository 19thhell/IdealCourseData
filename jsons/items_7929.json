Here's what our patients are saying:                                I am writing to you to express my complete satisfaction with the level of dental care that I have been receiving from my student dentist, Ms Kavita Patel. She has a most pleasing personality and is very respectful to a 74-year-old.   I feel very comfortable when she is examining and cleaning my teeth; she inspires trust. Her chair-side manner is very reassuring and her handling of dental instruments is very gentle. I appreciate that she keeps in touch with the faculty periodontist, Dr. Kye, and together they keep me abreast of the best plan for my dental health. She updates him whenever necessary. She also has Dr. Kye check her work before ending my appointment.   In my opinion she is already an outstanding dental practitioner. I still have one year left under her care, until she graduates, and will continue to enjoy that special care.

Moursi, DDS, PhD   Associate Professor, Pediatric Dentistry   OVERVIEW   The Department of Pediatric Dentistry was founded in 1949, as one of the first in the nation, and has always been committed to community service and care for the underserved. The department established a modality of nonpharmacologic behavior management and anticipatory guidance that has been a model in the specialty. The core philosophy is that oral health care of the infant and child is the responsibility of the primary care provider and through health promotion and prevention of oral disease, every child can grow up with a healthy and intact dentition.    The Department of Pediatric Dentistry has developed programs to aid in improving access and providing care to children regardless of their medical or financial status. There is a long history of working with the community and public schools to provide oral health education and treatment to children. A unique aspect of this community service is the NYUCD mobile van Smiling Faces, Going Places that brings comprehensive dental care to underserved populations in New York City at public schools, Head Start facilities, and shelters for homeless children of New York City. Some of the other programs include the following:     A 25-year history of providing care to public school children at the pediatric dentistry clinic for comprehensive care through a school busing program.   Outreach programs that provide examinations to 5,000 children annually including physically and emotionally challenged children   Community health fairs citywide to provide oral health education, screenings, and referrals, including the New York City Special Olympics, Special Smiles Program.   Affiliation with New York City Administration for Children's Services and Head Start centers to provide oral health examinations and a busing treatment program for comprehensive care.   \u201cPlaying It Safe\u201d Mouth Guard Program to provide preventive service through community centers and schools.

The philosophy of early prevention and nonpharmacologic        management is used to instill in the child and parent that dentistry        is an expected part of good overall health. The curriculum focuses on        the anatomic, physiologic, and psychological differences and changes        that occur as children become adults and the modifications that are        necessary in dental care. Throughout students\u2019 education, they        participate in one of the nation\u2019s largest outreach programs at        public school system and community centers (Head Start centers).                                                            First Year                               In the first year, the student learns about health promotion and preventive strategies and general dentistry restorative techniques as applicable to the pediatric dentition through the integrated courses of General Dentistry Simulation as well as through community-based programs. Simulation courses provide the student with the basic skills required to diagnose and treat the growing child and include pediatric prevention and basic restorative techniques, while community outreach gives the first-year dental student the opportunity to apply these skills.                                                              Second Year                               During the second year, students are presented the pediatric dentistry curriculum through the integrated lectures courses of General Dentistry Simulation, Diagnosis Risk Assessment and Disease Management, Growth Guidance, and Survey of Dental Specialties series. Lectures in the second year focus on diagnostic and foundation knowledge of considerations in pediatric dentistry and include diagnostic tools, behavior management, child development, risk assessment and prevention, space management, and restorative dentistry. Competencies in the area of child abuse and neglect of the pediatric patient, and prevention techniques including injury prevention, are required for promotion to the next level of education.    Clinical care experience expands in the second year through more advanced community-based programs.                                                              Third Year                               Lectures in the third year deal with the specialty treatment of pediatric        dentistry problems. Advanced pediatric topics included are behavior        modification for the noncompliant patient, special patient care, developmental        problems, traumatic injuries, health promotion, and anticipatory guidance.        Students present clinical cases during seminars that integrate patient        care from a case-based, patient-focused perspective.                   During the third year, students begin to provide comprehensive patient        care of pediatric patients in the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic. Opportunities        exist to develop skills in clinical treatment of a wide variety of childhood        conditions. Emphasis is given to prevention, changing concepts in caries        restorations including nonsurgical care, community outreach programs,        and provision of care to underserved children.                                                                       Fourth Year                               Senior students continue to provide comprehensive patient care of pediatric        patients in the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic with competencies in the        area of diagnostic, emergency care, prevention, and restorative care.        Opportunities exist to treat the more difficult pediatric patient. Seminars        in the fourth year utilize the student\u2019s acquired skills to further        comprehensive treatment of pediatric patients in a general practice        environment.                                                              Pediatric Dentistry Honors Program                               This program allows students        to finely focus their pediatric dentistry skills through seminars, treatment        of very young pediatric patients using conscious sedation and behavior        management, and hospital rotations where they provide patient care under        general anesthesia.                      POSTDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   &gt; Advanced Education Program in Pediatric Dentistry          INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM   &gt; Pediatric Dentistry Program for International Dentists          RESEARCH   Past research in the department has been focused on the early treatment, preventive strategies, and educational models to disseminate this information to the necessary providers and parents of the pediatric population.   Some of the present research projects in the department include investigations of utilization of emergency services, oral health disparities, compliance with care, use of topical and local anesthesia in pediatric patients, developmental norms, and effective early intervention strategies.

She has a most pleasing personality and is very respectful to a 74-year-old.   I feel very comfortable when she is examining and cleaning my teeth; she inspires trust. Her chair-side manner is very reassuring and her handling of dental instruments is very gentle. I appreciate that she keeps in touch with the faculty periodontist, Dr. Kye, and together they keep me abreast of the best plan for my dental health. She updates him whenever necessary. She also has Dr. Kye check her work before ending my appointment.   In my opinion she is already an outstanding dental practitioner. I still have one year left under her care, until she graduates, and will continue to enjoy that special care.

Moursi, DDS, PhD   Associate Professor, Pediatric Dentistry   OVERVIEW   The Department of Pediatric Dentistry was founded in 1949, as one of the first in the nation, and has always been committed to community service and care for the underserved. The department established a modality of nonpharmacologic behavior management and anticipatory guidance that has been a model in the specialty. The core philosophy is that oral health care of the infant and child is the responsibility of the primary care provider and through health promotion and prevention of oral disease, every child can grow up with a healthy and intact dentition.    The Department of Pediatric Dentistry has developed programs to aid in improving access and providing care to children regardless of their medical or financial status. There is a long history of working with the community and public schools to provide oral health education and treatment to children. A unique aspect of this community service is the NYUCD mobile van Smiling Faces, Going Places that brings comprehensive dental care to underserved populations in New York City at public schools, Head Start facilities, and shelters for homeless children of New York City. Some of the other programs include the following:     A 25-year history of providing care to public school children at the pediatric dentistry clinic for comprehensive care through a school busing program.   Outreach programs that provide examinations to 5,000 children annually including physically and emotionally challenged children   Community health fairs citywide to provide oral health education, screenings, and referrals, including the New York City Special Olympics, Special Smiles Program.   Affiliation with New York City Administration for Children's Services and Head Start centers to provide oral health examinations and a busing treatment program for comprehensive care.   \u201cPlaying It Safe\u201d Mouth Guard Program to provide preventive service through community centers and schools.

The philosophy of early prevention and nonpharmacologic        management is used to instill in the child and parent that dentistry        is an expected part of good overall health. The curriculum focuses on        the anatomic, physiologic, and psychological differences and changes        that occur as children become adults and the modifications that are        necessary in dental care. Throughout students\u2019 education, they        participate in one of the nation\u2019s largest outreach programs at        public school system and community centers (Head Start centers).                                                            First Year                               In the first year, the student learns about health promotion and preventive strategies and general dentistry restorative techniques as applicable to the pediatric dentition through the integrated courses of General Dentistry Simulation as well as through community-based programs. Simulation courses provide the student with the basic skills required to diagnose and treat the growing child and include pediatric prevention and basic restorative techniques, while community outreach gives the first-year dental student the opportunity to apply these skills.                                                              Second Year                               During the second year, students are presented the pediatric dentistry curriculum through the integrated lectures courses of General Dentistry Simulation, Diagnosis Risk Assessment and Disease Management, Growth Guidance, and Survey of Dental Specialties series. Lectures in the second year focus on diagnostic and foundation knowledge of considerations in pediatric dentistry and include diagnostic tools, behavior management, child development, risk assessment and prevention, space management, and restorative dentistry. Competencies in the area of child abuse and neglect of the pediatric patient, and prevention techniques including injury prevention, are required for promotion to the next level of education.    Clinical care experience expands in the second year through more advanced community-based programs.                                                              Third Year                               Lectures in the third year deal with the specialty treatment of pediatric        dentistry problems. Advanced pediatric topics included are behavior        modification for the noncompliant patient, special patient care, developmental        problems, traumatic injuries, health promotion, and anticipatory guidance.        Students present clinical cases during seminars that integrate patient        care from a case-based, patient-focused perspective.                   During the third year, students begin to provide comprehensive patient        care of pediatric patients in the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic. Opportunities        exist to develop skills in clinical treatment of a wide variety of childhood        conditions. Emphasis is given to prevention, changing concepts in caries        restorations including nonsurgical care, community outreach programs,        and provision of care to underserved children.                                                                       Fourth Year                               Senior students continue to provide comprehensive patient care of pediatric        patients in the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic with competencies in the        area of diagnostic, emergency care, prevention, and restorative care.        Opportunities exist to treat the more difficult pediatric patient. Seminars        in the fourth year utilize the student\u2019s acquired skills to further        comprehensive treatment of pediatric patients in a general practice        environment.                                                              Pediatric Dentistry Honors Program                               This program allows students        to finely focus their pediatric dentistry skills through seminars, treatment        of very young pediatric patients using conscious sedation and behavior        management, and hospital rotations where they provide patient care under        general anesthesia.                      POSTDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   &gt; Advanced Education Program in Pediatric Dentistry          INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM   &gt; Pediatric Dentistry Program for International Dentists          RESEARCH   Past research in the department has been focused on the early treatment, preventive strategies, and educational models to disseminate this information to the necessary providers and parents of the pediatric population.   Some of the present research projects in the department include investigations of utilization of emergency services, oral health disparities, compliance with care, use of topical and local anesthesia in pediatric patients, developmental norms, and effective early intervention strategies.
