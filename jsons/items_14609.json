Email:     Personal Homepage                 Areas of Research/Interest:   Environmental economics; environmental policy instruments; sustainable development; economics of climate change.     Bio:   Maria Damon holds her Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California at San Diego. Her research focuses on environmental policy design, and how understanding decision-making can lead to more effective policies. In contexts ranging from climate change to marine pollution control to fisheries management, Damon's work analyzes human and firm behavior and uses these insights to inform the design of environmental policy instruments. Her research also investigates ways that household behavior is affected by the impacts of climate change, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and what these impacts imply for the design of economic safety net policies. Damon also has conducted research on the relationships between health and the environment in developing countries. In addition to her Ph.D. in Economics, Damon completed an NSF-sponsored Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) joint doctoral program on marine biodiversity and conservation with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. She is a research associate with the Environment for Development Initiative, a capacity-building program in environmental economics focused on research, policy advice, and teaching in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, and China. Damon also served a one-year appointment as the Staff Economist for Environmental Policy at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and has worked as a research analyst at The World Bank.
