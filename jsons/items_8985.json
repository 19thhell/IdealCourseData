The study of Greek and Roman Art and Architecture is at a critical stage in its development. In recent years, this field has been characterized by an ever-increasing range of approaches, under the influence of various disciplines such as Sociology, Semiotics, Gender Theory, Anthropology, Reception Theory, and Hermeneutics. The scope of this Seminar is to explore key aspects of Greek and Roman Art and Architecture, and to assess the current state of the discipline by reviewing and subjecting its current larger theoretical implications, methodologies, and directions of research to critical scrutiny.      Please check the events calendar for upcoming seminars of Greek and Roman Arts and Architecture.      The Seminar on Greek and Roman Art and Architecture is sponsored by the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University, with invaluable support from James R. McCredie and with the contribution of the New York University Center for Ancient Studies .      2015       Thursday, March 12, 2015, 6:00 PM   Stefano Vassallo , Superintendency of Palermo   The New Excavations in the Necropolis of Himera   RSVP required       Thursday, April 2, 2015, 6:00 PM   Verena Gassner , Professor , University of Vienna   The Hellenistic Sanctuaries of Velia       RSVP required       Wednesday, April 29, 2015, 6:00 PM   Michael Squire , Lecturer , King's College, London   Homer and the Ekphrasists: Text and Image in the Elder Philostratus\u2019s Scamander (Imagines I.1)   RSVP required                 Archive      February 26, 2015   Jenifer Neils , Elsie B.
