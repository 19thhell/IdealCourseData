The Center offers an undergraduate academic program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, a series of evening events that bring eminent medievalists and early modernists to the NYU campus, an annual conference each Spring, and it also supports both undergraduate and graduate student associations. Its largest aim is to provide an intellectual center for medieval and early modern studies at NYU, fostering collaboration and scholarly conversation, drawing not only on the university's own outstanding resources, but on the superb libraries, museums, and collections in the New York area.
