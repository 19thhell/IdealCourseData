Writers in Paris students choose to focus on either poetry or fiction, and attend daily writing workshops, craft seminars, and literary readings and events. Writing and reading assignments are designed to encourage immersion in the city. For example, poets might visit the Louvre to write ekphrastic poems or create Parisian street sonnets by taking a 14-block walk of the St. Denis area, where Fran\u00e7ois Villon lived, and generating a line of poetry per block. Fiction writers might study dialogue by listening for overheard speech at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 or learn about description and setting by writing a story set in the neighborhood where Hemingway lived and worked. Writers in Paris is open to eligible NYU and visiting (non-NYU) undergraduates. The priority application deadline is February 1, 2015. Please visit the  NYU Summer Study Abroad page  and click on \"Apply Now\" to find the application (which will be available as of December 1, 2014).    *Interested in receiving updates about Writers in Paris 2015?

Writers in Paris students choose to focus on either poetry or fiction, and attend daily writing workshops, craft seminars, and literary readings and events. Writing and reading assignments are designed to encourage immersion in the city. For example, poets might visit the Louvre to write ekphrastic poems or create Parisian street sonnets by taking a 14-block walk of the St. Denis area, where Fran\u00e7ois Villon lived, and generating a line of poetry per block. Fiction writers might study dialogue by listening for overheard speech at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 or learn about description and setting by writing a story set in the neighborhood where Hemingway lived and worked. Writers in Paris is open to eligible NYU and visiting (non-NYU) undergraduates. The priority application deadline is February 1, 2015. Please visit the  NYU Summer Study Abroad page  and click on \"Apply Now\" to find the application (which will be available as of December 1, 2014).    *Interested in receiving updates about Writers in Paris 2015?
