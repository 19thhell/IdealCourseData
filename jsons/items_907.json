Using the incomparable  theatrical resources of New York City as well as the superb intellectual assets  of New York University, the department has created a B.F.A. (Bachelor of Fine  Arts) program that aims to establish the artistic and intellectual foundations  for a successful and sustained life in the professional theatre and allied  disciplines.   top Who makes up your faculty? Internationally recognized theatre studies scholars and accomplished, working teaching artists provide a rich, vibrant and diverse curriculum for our students. top I have heard about \u201cthe studios\u201d in the Drama department. Can you please explain the studio system? Upon acceptance into the department, students are placed into one of eight different primary studios where they begin intensive conservatory training towards a strong foundation in technique. Students remain in their primary studio for two full years (four consecutive semesters). Once primary training is completed, students have many options for advanced training (see question below).  \u2028\u2028\u2028It is important to understand that you are applying to the Department of Drama at Tisch School of the Arts and not to a particular studio. The studio placement decision lies with the Department of Drama. \u2028 The eight primary studios are listed below. Six are acting studios, one is a music theatre program and one is dedicated to production and design.\u200b Our directing program is housed at the Playwrights Horizons Theater School. Our concentrated musical theatre training program lives at the New Studio on Broadway.  Stella Adler Studio of Acting   Atlantic Acting School   Experimental Theatre Wing   The Meisner Studio      New Studio on Broadway   Playwrights Horizons Theater School (also  directing) Production &amp; Design (design,  production, stage management)       Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute top Do the primary studios only offer classes in acting? No. All performance-based primary studios  offer foundations in areas such as acting technique, vocal technique, dance and  movement, script analysis, scene study, improvisation and often singing.   In addition, we have studios for directing, music theatre, and design,  production and stage management.       top Do I choose my primary studio? No. It is important to remember that you are applying to the  Department of Drama at Tisch School of the Arts and not to a particular  studio. The studio placement decision lies with the department.        top Do I stay in one primary studio for four years? No. You are required to remain in your primary studio for the first two years of the program. Once primary training is completed, you will have many options for advanced training. These are outlined below. top What are my advanced professional training options after primary studio? Once primary training is completed, you will have many options for advanced training during your remaining semesters. You may stay in your primary studio to delve deeper into the technique or you might try advanced training at another primary studio to learn a different approach to creating performance. Some studios are only available at the advanced level, as they are more specialized in training. Focus areas include: classical training, Viewpoints theory and acting for the camera. You may also choose to do an internship or study abroad to continue your professional training. top What kind of performance opportunities does the department offer?                                     Each year, the department provides over 150 performance  opportunities, including departmental productions, studio workshops,  independent directing projects and student-generated work. The department  offers a proposal-based system of choosing the season, with projects ranging  from full-scale, fully-realized productions to smaller workshops and even more  intimate cabaret and avant-garde performances. The season is an extension  of the curriculum, providing learning opportunities for students as both  participants and audience members. Please note the restrictions on  performing for first-year and transfer students below.       top May I audition for shows as soon as I begin at Tisch? No. Freshpeople must wait  one year before they are eligible to audition for departmental or studio  productions. Transfers must wait one semester to audition. We think it is  important for you to take time to embrace the new techniques of your primary training  and to adjust to college life and living in New York City. You must be in  good academic standing in order to audition.
