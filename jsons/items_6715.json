Please see the program below for further details.                            Federica Anichini , Fordham University, New York  Municipal Implications and Political Theories from the Vita Nova to the Monarchia In the first book of his De monarchia, Dante elaborates on a distinctive human mark, the \u2018potentia intellectiva,\u2019 and declares that such \u2018potentia\u2019 can be wholly actualized not by individuals or social groupings but only by the whole of humanity. The reference here to the possible intellect and to Averroes compelled scholars to include this passage among the texts illuminating the presence of (or lack thereof) unaltered Averroistic components in Dante\u2019s oeuvre. I employ this reference to the possible intellect in relation to the, allegedly, short-lived friendship between Dante and Guido Cavalcanti. In my paper I investigate the extent to which the De monarchia frames the dialogue of Guido and Dante, and whether such dialogue does encompass topics connected not only with the theory of love but, also, with political theories. On the grounds of these premises, I examine the work marking the peak of Guido\u2019s and Dante\u2019s solidarity, the Vita Nova . The \u2018prosimetrum,\u2019 I argue, has a municipal import\u2014supported by the Florentine environment on which the text is staged\u2014that is incorporated in the intellectual exchange between Guido and Dante. The political thread of the dialogue is resumed in the De monarchia . By including in his essay a remark about the possible intellect, Dante carries out the ultimate assimilation of one of Cavalcanti\u2019s tenets\u2014individual confinement into one\u2019s senses\u2014into the project of a collective enterprise. Maria Luisa Ardizzone , New York University, New York Wireless Communications: Invisible Links between Convivio and Monarchia The continuity between Convivio and Monarchia is well known. This paper focuses on the invisible rather than the evident links between the two works. After introducing the theory of the possible intellect as presented in Monarchia I , we consider how this theory differs from that offered in the last treatise of the Convivio . A modification of perspective is assumed to be the reason for the discrepancy and theoretical discontinuity. Because it is generally accepted that Convivio 4 is close, chronologically speaking, to the writing of Monarchia , our exploration shows that a temporal continuity makes manifest a theoretical discontinuity. My paper will examine the reasons for this discontinuity. Wireless communication thus permits an understanding of how and why both continuity and discontinuity govern the relationship between the two works.  Jean Baptiste Brenet , Universit\u00e9 de Paris 1-Panth\u00e9on, Sorbonne Dante and Averroes (Monarchy I, 3): Proposal for a New Interpretation In Monarchy I , asserting the necessity that the \u201cmultitude\u201d of human beings actualize without interruption their intellectual power, Dante cites Averroes. Our intention is to analyze this citation from The Long Commentary on the De Anima of Aristotle to determine what Dante looks for in Averroes, or in the Averroism of his time, and evaluate the results.  William Caferro , Vanderbilt University Dante, Empire and the Transfiguration of Charlemagne My paper examines the historical context of Dante\u2019s treatment of empire. His paper stresses the complicated and contested nature of the contemporary discourse, which involved not only debate on the primacy of the emperor versus pope (Dante), but also discussion of the relationship between western and eastern (ie. Greek Byzantine) claims to authority and the nature of the original translatio imperii by Charlemagne. The essay assesses Dante views in terms of several well-known writers (Ptolemy of Lucca, Giovanni Villani, Martino da Canal). Above all, it positions Dante\u2019s construct in terms of Riccobaldo of Ferrara, whose Compilatio chronologica (1313) gives, along with a Dantesque affirmation of \u201cbuon antico tempo,\u201d a detailed discussion of imperium east and west, emphasizing the role of Charlemagne, who is a strikingly different character than in Dante.  Paolo Chiesa , Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano Dante as Scientist and as Prophet : The Three Prologues of Monarchia Each of the three books of Monarchia is preceded by a highly literary and stylistic prologue. Although not closely connected with the development of the argument, they may be read as documenting the ideas Dante had about the work he was writing, and about his own task in writing it. In the first prologue, he states his intention to produce a treatise of the greatest profit to mankind, investigating a hidden truth of the highest importance having to do with the real nature of universal monarchy. Proposing this aim, he claims for himself the role of pioneer in the field of political studies, comparing himself indirectly to great scientists of the past (Aristotle, Euclid, Cicero). In the second prologue, Dante continues to present himself as a scientist, with a significant reflection on scientific psychology and ethics (when the scientist discovers the truth, he says, he feels superior to the ignorant people who do not yet know it but must generously share his discovery with them). Nevertheless, his position becomes progressively prophetic, as announced by the powerful quotation of the Psalms at the beginning of the prologue: the task of the prophet is to present the truth, and this truth, once disclosed, will \u00abbreak the chains of ignorance\u00bb and produce liberation. In the third prologue, Dante claims finally a wholly prophetic role for himself. He cites as authorities books of the Old Testament (Isaiah, the Proverbs of Solomon), and especially the book of the prophet Daniel, who was persecuted for the truth \u2013 an outcome Dante expects for himself as well. The three prologues, read in sequence, show that the roles of scientist and prophet are for Dante inseparable and largely overlap: both have as their task the presentation of the truth. The logical-scientific method, which Dante follows in his research, leads to knowledge of God\u2019s will, so that in this way the scientist becomes the prophet of modern times.  Iacopo Costa , CNRS-LEM, Villejuif\u2014Commission L\u00e9onine, Paris The Will of the Emperor and the Empire Freedom Among the doctrines put forth by Dante in Monarchia we find a theory according to which the Emperor would grant the highest freedom to human beings (1, XII). My paper analyses the anthropological, psychological, political and theological implications of this theory. I will consider Dante\u2019s utilization of Boethius\u2019 definition of free will ( liberum de voluntate iudicium ), which brings out the following issues: Dante\u2019s position on human freedom, the relation between individual freedom and the will of the Emperor that rules it, the link between the earthly happiness as it takes place in the Empire, and the eternal happiness presented in Paradiso . In addition, I will evaluate the implications of Dante\u2019s position in light of the theological doctrine of charity and its effects, which are peace and concord.  Warren Ginsberg , University of Oregon \u201cFenno una rota di s\u00e9 tutti e trei\u201d: Dialectic, Rhetoric, and History in the Monarchia When Dante contested the papal claim of sovereignty over temporal as well as spiritual matters, he knew he had to back his arguments with all the resources of scientific reasoning. Dialectic, however, was not simply the forma tractandi that his subject demanded and his audience expected. The syllogisms of the Monarchia are intrinsically rhetorical as well; they were the instrument Dante utilized both to stand above his prior political allegiances and to bracket God\u2019s. The forum Dante planned to enter called for a detached disputant bent solely on demonstrating the necessity of his conclusions; he could not, therefore, speak as the champion of Frederick II, as he had in the Convivio . Nor could he decry the wickedness of the Florentines who opposed Henry VII, as he does in the Epistles . Neither could he inveigh against the overreach of a Boniface or a Nicholas, as he had in the Comedy . But the major and minor premises that he deployed in place of more partisan polemical modes underwrite a deeper excision and replacement: the substitution of Rome for Jerusalem as God\u2019s city of peace. Rome, Dante insists, is the fulcrum of providential history, and its Emperor, the Holy Roman Emperor, is the prince Christ has authorized to bring to men of good will the happiness they were meant to enjoy on earth. The thesis I want to explore is that Dante makes logic the voice of history in order to inoculate his interpretation of it against the two most important works that implicitly argue against him. The first, of course, is the De civitate Dei ; Dante knew that many of the figures he presents as proof of the rightness of Rome\u2019s triumph to Augustine were proof of its flaws. The second text is the Bible, specifically the sequence that Dante would have said runs from Judges through Kings. These books, which relate the rise and fall of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, are dominated by two ideal monarchs: one fulfilled God\u2019s will by gathering the twelve tribes into a nation and by establishing wide dominion over many non-believing peoples; the other, given the chance, did not ask God for riches, or power, or honor, or long life, but for the wisdom to govern justly, and was granted so much of it that, \u201cse \ua78cl vero \u00e8 vero,\u201d as Dante says in the Paradiso , his equal has never arisen. In many ways each ruler adumbrates the Emperor and the Empire that Dante says Christianity so desperately wanted. Yet in the Monarchia , David (with one circuitous exception) is not king David, but the psalmist, and Solomon is never king Solomon, only the author of Proverbs .  Francis Hittinger , Columbia University Dante as Critic of Political Economy in the Monarchia   The paper will read Monarchia along with passages reflecting Aristotle\u2019s most developed economic and political thought: Book 1 of the Politics (especially the discussion of oikonomia as chrematistics vs. necessary wealth-getting within a just polity), Books 4 and 5 of the Nicomachean Ethics (on generosity, monetary exchange, and justice), and other loci from the Metaphysics and elsewhere so important for his discussion of economy. These discussions, moreover, are even more revealing when seen within context of the development of Franciscan and Dominican Economic thought of the late 13th and early 14th centuries\u2014such as that of Olivi and Oresme. In sum, the paper will seek to articulate, also by comparison with the main economic and political arguments of the earlier work Convivio (esp. Book 4), how we might come to understand Dante in the Monarchia as a critic of medieval political economy, whose \u2018Aristotelian\u2019 denouncements of greed, monetary accumulation, and their negative effects on society are echoed, centuries later, by modern critics of political economy, chief amongst them Karl Marx. Diego Quaglioni , Universit\u00e0 di Trento Dante\u2019s Political Realism The category of realism, so often evoked in regard to Dante\u2019s Comedy after Auerbach, failed to find the same credit among interpreters of the Monarchia . With its doctrinal expression of the reality of dualism in the permanent tension between spiritual and temporal power, both of which assume a hegemonic position in Western society, Dante\u2019s Monarchia has often been read as an abstract ideal of political perfection, as a utopia out of its time and an evocation of a medieval universalistic dream in a world of rising national powers: the ideological utopia of the Empire. Dante\u2019s Monarchia is indeed a doctrinal work; however, its nature is in fact neither ideological nor utopian, but rather paradoxically realistic. Its realism consists in announcing one of the nightmares of modernity, that of mono-dimensionality of power and total integration, in which the reasons of politics and of conscience mingle and vanish, to the fatal loss of both. In Dante\u2019s Monarchia the relationship between the Empire and the States is conceived, in modern terms, as a power relation between original and derivative powers. The relationship between the two universal poles, spiritual and temporal, is also conceived, in modern terms, as a relationship of mutual autonomy. It is the only possible relationship that excludes the possibility that the authority of one may be the foundation and principle of the other\u2014a rigidly monistic view that Dante seeks to avoid. Only a simplistic view of the Middle Ages prevents us from understanding that Dante\u2019s emphasis on imperial sovereignty as a universal principle of order belongs precisely to the crisis of universalism. The Empire continues to be the core of a system of authoritative symbols, for which the Emperor is the expression and image of a universal principle of conserving political order. The modern conception of power is modeled on the relationship with tradition. As Hans Kelsen recognized at the beginning of the twentieth century, Dante\u2019s Monarchia offers the first example of a legal-political model, from which the modern concept of State sovereignty may be inferred. Prue Shaw , University of Cambridge British Library ms. Add. 6891 of the Monarchia The coming to light of British Library ms. Additional 6891 a few years ago understandably sparked huge interest among scholars who work on the Monarchia . The date of the manuscript alone \u2013 mid-fourteenth century, but perhaps even earlier \u2013 was remarkable; its garbled version of the famous inciso of I xii 6 with its cross-reference to the Paradiso , a crucial piece of evidence in the debate on the dating of the treatise, made it an even more intense focus of interest. This paper looks at how ms. Add. 6891 affects our understanding of the textual transmission of the treatise, and evaluates some of the recent scholarly responses to the discovery of this new witness. It also considers the earliest German translation of the Monarchia , printed in Basel in autumn 1559 at the same time as the editio princeps , and newly accessible to scholars in a digitized edition which is a model of functionality and user-friendliness. Justin Steinberg , University of Chicago Dante\u2019s Theology of Miracles in Monarchia II.4: Law, Sovereignty, Violence In Monarchia II.4 , as part of his argument that Roman empire was founded by right and not simply by force, Dante classifies as miraculous various episodes of Roman history. These miracles appear to lend a providential justification to Rome\u2019s imperial rule. Critics have long recognized that Dante\u2019s classification diverges from traditional theological accounts of the nature of miracles. But this tradition was itself extremely varied and in Dante\u2019s time theologians often disagreed about the ontological status of miracles. Behind these disagreement there were also often highly contested visions of political and legal authority, especially regarding how one should understand the relation of a sovereign God to the \u201claws\u201d of his own created universe. In this paper, I will argue that Dante\u2019s account of Roman miracles, however unconventional, deliberately intervenes in these debates and needs to be understood in their terms. As a divine act that appears to transgress the normal rules of creation yet remains within a larger providential order, the miracle is fundamental for Dante\u2019s seemingly paradoxical argument in book two that the foundational violence of Roman empire is based on right, not merely on might. More generally, this \u201cnormative violence\u201d manifested in the miracle is crucial for Dante\u2019s vision of political and literary discretion, whether it takes the form of the emperor\u2019s judgment or in the liberties of the exegete.  Donatella Stocchi-Perucchio , University of Rochester Power and Right: Dante\u2019s Monarchy and the Juridical Literature in the First Half of the 13th Century This paper addresses Dante\u2019s concern for the relationship between universal power and the limitations imposed by right in the context of the literature, both encomiastic and juridical, that flourished around the imperial Magna Curia and the papal court in the first half of the 13th century. In particular, we will focus on a text of uncertain attribution discovered in Germany in 1954 by R.M. Kloos and identified as a premise to the Proem of the Constitutions of Melfi . Andrea Tabarroni , Universit\u00e0 di Udine Magister Sex Principiorum and the Realism of Forms in Dante's Political Thought In Monarchia I , xii 3-5, Dante refers to the anonymous author of the Liber Sex Principiorum in order to give an ontological grounding to his demonstration of the superiority of the imperial world-order in assuring moral and political justice to all of mankind. Resorting to such an obscure and already somewhat neglected logical work can easily strike the reader of the Monarchia as a far-fetched move on Dante\u2019s part, perhaps to be explained within the framework of an authorial strategy of technical competence. But closer consideration of the philosophical views of the 12th century anonymous master, and of their reception in the 13th century, offers interesting clues that allow us to reach a better understanding of the ontological principles governing Dante's political thought. Paola Ureni , The City University of New York Medicine and Dante's Political Thought The focus on intellectual and political perfection, in the Monarchia , overcomes the explicit corporeal \u2013 even biological \u2013 references, which can be found in other Dantean works such as the Convivio and the Commedia ; however, a few traces of that physical condition prompt to question the relation between the science of the body and Dante\u2019s political thought. In discussing the political concept of concordia \u2013 rooted in the unity of men\u2019s wills under the guidance of the monarch \u2013 Dante refers to the perfect disposition of both the soul and the body of an individual as an example of concordia , and relates, therefore, the notion of concordia to the perfect mental and bodily condition. A direct quotation from Galen\u2019s De cognoscendis morbis curandisque animi morbi reveals Dante\u2019s knowledge of this quite uncommon Galenic text that clearly highlights intellectual perfection as the realization of the human being, and the rational faculty as the hegemonic principle of human life. On the thread of concepts such as concordia and the hegemonic principle, we may investigate a relation between the individual human being and the human genus that reaches its perfection and happiness under the guidance of the monarch. If this relation is correct, the necessity of a political ruling principle will reflect the same necessary presence of a hegemonic element, which rules the human being in its unity of body and soul, and that philosophical and scientific traditions located either in the brain or in the heart. Dante is indeed aware of these traditions throughout his works, and the concept of a ruling element concerns the human being, political thought, and even language. In the Monarchia a necessary relation links hegemonic principle and earthly happiness. In medical texts by Galen, Avicenna ( Liber Canonis ) or Averroes ( Colliget ), a seemingly necessary relation links mental and physical good conditions to happiness. Even though the Monarchia does not show these references to a corporeal dimension, can scientific auctoritates not be lost but rather absorbed in a new synthesis \u2013 finalized to Dante\u2019s political thought \u2013 where earthly happiness, guaranteed by the actualization of the possible intellect, finds its autonomy?

Book 4), how we might come to understand Dante in the Monarchia as a critic of medieval political economy, whose \u2018Aristotelian\u2019 denouncements of greed, monetary accumulation, and their negative effects on society are echoed, centuries later, by modern critics of political economy, chief amongst them Karl Marx. Diego Quaglioni , Universit\u00e0 di Trento Dante\u2019s Political Realism The category of realism, so often evoked in regard to Dante\u2019s Comedy after Auerbach, failed to find the same credit among interpreters of the Monarchia . With its doctrinal expression of the reality of dualism in the permanent tension between spiritual and temporal power, both of which assume a hegemonic position in Western society, Dante\u2019s Monarchia has often been read as an abstract ideal of political perfection, as a utopia out of its time and an evocation of a medieval universalistic dream in a world of rising national powers: the ideological utopia of the Empire. Dante\u2019s Monarchia is indeed a doctrinal work; however, its nature is in fact neither ideological nor utopian, but rather paradoxically realistic. Its realism consists in announcing one of the nightmares of modernity, that of mono-dimensionality of power and total integration, in which the reasons of politics and of conscience mingle and vanish, to the fatal loss of both. In Dante\u2019s Monarchia the relationship between the Empire and the States is conceived, in modern terms, as a power relation between original and derivative powers. The relationship between the two universal poles, spiritual and temporal, is also conceived, in modern terms, as a relationship of mutual autonomy. It is the only possible relationship that excludes the possibility that the authority of one may be the foundation and principle of the other\u2014a rigidly monistic view that Dante seeks to avoid. Only a simplistic view of the Middle Ages prevents us from understanding that Dante\u2019s emphasis on imperial sovereignty as a universal principle of order belongs precisely to the crisis of universalism. The Empire continues to be the core of a system of authoritative symbols, for which the Emperor is the expression and image of a universal principle of conserving political order. The modern conception of power is modeled on the relationship with tradition. As Hans Kelsen recognized at the beginning of the twentieth century, Dante\u2019s Monarchia offers the first example of a legal-political model, from which the modern concept of State sovereignty may be inferred. Prue Shaw , University of Cambridge British Library ms. Add. 6891 of the Monarchia The coming to light of British Library ms. Additional 6891 a few years ago understandably sparked huge interest among scholars who work on the Monarchia . The date of the manuscript alone \u2013 mid-fourteenth century, but perhaps even earlier \u2013 was remarkable; its garbled version of the famous inciso of I xii 6 with its cross-reference to the Paradiso , a crucial piece of evidence in the debate on the dating of the treatise, made it an even more intense focus of interest. This paper looks at how ms. Add. 6891 affects our understanding of the textual transmission of the treatise, and evaluates some of the recent scholarly responses to the discovery of this new witness. It also considers the earliest German translation of the Monarchia , printed in Basel in autumn 1559 at the same time as the editio princeps , and newly accessible to scholars in a digitized edition which is a model of functionality and user-friendliness. Justin Steinberg , University of Chicago Dante\u2019s Theology of Miracles in Monarchia II.4: Law, Sovereignty, Violence In Monarchia II.4 , as part of his argument that Roman empire was founded by right and not simply by force, Dante classifies as miraculous various episodes of Roman history. These miracles appear to lend a providential justification to Rome\u2019s imperial rule. Critics have long recognized that Dante\u2019s classification diverges from traditional theological accounts of the nature of miracles. But this tradition was itself extremely varied and in Dante\u2019s time theologians often disagreed about the ontological status of miracles. Behind these disagreement there were also often highly contested visions of political and legal authority, especially regarding how one should understand the relation of a sovereign God to the \u201claws\u201d of his own created universe. In this paper, I will argue that Dante\u2019s account of Roman miracles, however unconventional, deliberately intervenes in these debates and needs to be understood in their terms. As a divine act that appears to transgress the normal rules of creation yet remains within a larger providential order, the miracle is fundamental for Dante\u2019s seemingly paradoxical argument in book two that the foundational violence of Roman empire is based on right, not merely on might. More generally, this \u201cnormative violence\u201d manifested in the miracle is crucial for Dante\u2019s vision of political and literary discretion, whether it takes the form of the emperor\u2019s judgment or in the liberties of the exegete.  Donatella Stocchi-Perucchio , University of Rochester Power and Right: Dante\u2019s Monarchy and the Juridical Literature in the First Half of the 13th Century This paper addresses Dante\u2019s concern for the relationship between universal power and the limitations imposed by right in the context of the literature, both encomiastic and juridical, that flourished around the imperial Magna Curia and the papal court in the first half of the 13th century. In particular, we will focus on a text of uncertain attribution discovered in Germany in 1954 by R.M. Kloos and identified as a premise to the Proem of the Constitutions of Melfi . Andrea Tabarroni , Universit\u00e0 di Udine Magister Sex Principiorum and the Realism of Forms in Dante's Political Thought In Monarchia I , xii 3-5, Dante refers to the anonymous author of the Liber Sex Principiorum in order to give an ontological grounding to his demonstration of the superiority of the imperial world-order in assuring moral and political justice to all of mankind. Resorting to such an obscure and already somewhat neglected logical work can easily strike the reader of the Monarchia as a far-fetched move on Dante\u2019s part, perhaps to be explained within the framework of an authorial strategy of technical competence. But closer consideration of the philosophical views of the 12th century anonymous master, and of their reception in the 13th century, offers interesting clues that allow us to reach a better understanding of the ontological principles governing Dante's political thought. Paola Ureni , The City University of New York Medicine and Dante's Political Thought The focus on intellectual and political perfection, in the Monarchia , overcomes the explicit corporeal \u2013 even biological \u2013 references, which can be found in other Dantean works such as the Convivio and the Commedia ; however, a few traces of that physical condition prompt to question the relation between the science of the body and Dante\u2019s political thought. In discussing the political concept of concordia \u2013 rooted in the unity of men\u2019s wills under the guidance of the monarch \u2013 Dante refers to the perfect disposition of both the soul and the body of an individual as an example of concordia , and relates, therefore, the notion of concordia to the perfect mental and bodily condition. A direct quotation from Galen\u2019s De cognoscendis morbis curandisque animi morbi reveals Dante\u2019s knowledge of this quite uncommon Galenic text that clearly highlights intellectual perfection as the realization of the human being, and the rational faculty as the hegemonic principle of human life. On the thread of concepts such as concordia and the hegemonic principle, we may investigate a relation between the individual human being and the human genus that reaches its perfection and happiness under the guidance of the monarch. If this relation is correct, the necessity of a political ruling principle will reflect the same necessary presence of a hegemonic element, which rules the human being in its unity of body and soul, and that philosophical and scientific traditions located either in the brain or in the heart. Dante is indeed aware of these traditions throughout his works, and the concept of a ruling element concerns the human being, political thought, and even language. In the Monarchia a necessary relation links hegemonic principle and earthly happiness. In medical texts by Galen, Avicenna ( Liber Canonis ) or Averroes ( Colliget ), a seemingly necessary relation links mental and physical good conditions to happiness. Even though the Monarchia does not show these references to a corporeal dimension, can scientific auctoritates not be lost but rather absorbed in a new synthesis \u2013 finalized to Dante\u2019s political thought \u2013 where earthly happiness, guaranteed by the actualization of the possible intellect, finds its autonomy?

Please see the program below for further details.                            Federica Anichini , Fordham University, New York  Municipal Implications and Political Theories from the Vita Nova to the Monarchia In the first book of his De monarchia, Dante elaborates on a distinctive human mark, the \u2018potentia intellectiva,\u2019 and declares that such \u2018potentia\u2019 can be wholly actualized not by individuals or social groupings but only by the whole of humanity. The reference here to the possible intellect and to Averroes compelled scholars to include this passage among the texts illuminating the presence of (or lack thereof) unaltered Averroistic components in Dante\u2019s oeuvre. I employ this reference to the possible intellect in relation to the, allegedly, short-lived friendship between Dante and Guido Cavalcanti. In my paper I investigate the extent to which the De monarchia frames the dialogue of Guido and Dante, and whether such dialogue does encompass topics connected not only with the theory of love but, also, with political theories. On the grounds of these premises, I examine the work marking the peak of Guido\u2019s and Dante\u2019s solidarity, the Vita Nova . The \u2018prosimetrum,\u2019 I argue, has a municipal import\u2014supported by the Florentine environment on which the text is staged\u2014that is incorporated in the intellectual exchange between Guido and Dante. The political thread of the dialogue is resumed in the De monarchia . By including in his essay a remark about the possible intellect, Dante carries out the ultimate assimilation of one of Cavalcanti\u2019s tenets\u2014individual confinement into one\u2019s senses\u2014into the project of a collective enterprise. Maria Luisa Ardizzone , New York University, New York Wireless Communications: Invisible Links between Convivio and Monarchia The continuity between Convivio and Monarchia is well known. This paper focuses on the invisible rather than the evident links between the two works. After introducing the theory of the possible intellect as presented in Monarchia I , we consider how this theory differs from that offered in the last treatise of the Convivio . A modification of perspective is assumed to be the reason for the discrepancy and theoretical discontinuity. Because it is generally accepted that Convivio 4 is close, chronologically speaking, to the writing of Monarchia , our exploration shows that a temporal continuity makes manifest a theoretical discontinuity. My paper will examine the reasons for this discontinuity. Wireless communication thus permits an understanding of how and why both continuity and discontinuity govern the relationship between the two works.  Jean Baptiste Brenet , Universit\u00e9 de Paris 1-Panth\u00e9on, Sorbonne Dante and Averroes (Monarchy I, 3): Proposal for a New Interpretation In Monarchy I , asserting the necessity that the \u201cmultitude\u201d of human beings actualize without interruption their intellectual power, Dante cites Averroes. Our intention is to analyze this citation from The Long Commentary on the De Anima of Aristotle to determine what Dante looks for in Averroes, or in the Averroism of his time, and evaluate the results.  William Caferro , Vanderbilt University Dante, Empire and the Transfiguration of Charlemagne My paper examines the historical context of Dante\u2019s treatment of empire. His paper stresses the complicated and contested nature of the contemporary discourse, which involved not only debate on the primacy of the emperor versus pope (Dante), but also discussion of the relationship between western and eastern (ie. Greek Byzantine) claims to authority and the nature of the original translatio imperii by Charlemagne. The essay assesses Dante views in terms of several well-known writers (Ptolemy of Lucca, Giovanni Villani, Martino da Canal). Above all, it positions Dante\u2019s construct in terms of Riccobaldo of Ferrara, whose Compilatio chronologica (1313) gives, along with a Dantesque affirmation of \u201cbuon antico tempo,\u201d a detailed discussion of imperium east and west, emphasizing the role of Charlemagne, who is a strikingly different character than in Dante.  Paolo Chiesa , Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano Dante as Scientist and as Prophet : The Three Prologues of Monarchia Each of the three books of Monarchia is preceded by a highly literary and stylistic prologue. Although not closely connected with the development of the argument, they may be read as documenting the ideas Dante had about the work he was writing, and about his own task in writing it. In the first prologue, he states his intention to produce a treatise of the greatest profit to mankind, investigating a hidden truth of the highest importance having to do with the real nature of universal monarchy. Proposing this aim, he claims for himself the role of pioneer in the field of political studies, comparing himself indirectly to great scientists of the past (Aristotle, Euclid, Cicero). In the second prologue, Dante continues to present himself as a scientist, with a significant reflection on scientific psychology and ethics (when the scientist discovers the truth, he says, he feels superior to the ignorant people who do not yet know it but must generously share his discovery with them). Nevertheless, his position becomes progressively prophetic, as announced by the powerful quotation of the Psalms at the beginning of the prologue: the task of the prophet is to present the truth, and this truth, once disclosed, will \u00abbreak the chains of ignorance\u00bb and produce liberation. In the third prologue, Dante claims finally a wholly prophetic role for himself. He cites as authorities books of the Old Testament (Isaiah, the Proverbs of Solomon), and especially the book of the prophet Daniel, who was persecuted for the truth \u2013 an outcome Dante expects for himself as well. The three prologues, read in sequence, show that the roles of scientist and prophet are for Dante inseparable and largely overlap: both have as their task the presentation of the truth. The logical-scientific method, which Dante follows in his research, leads to knowledge of God\u2019s will, so that in this way the scientist becomes the prophet of modern times.  Iacopo Costa , CNRS-LEM, Villejuif\u2014Commission L\u00e9onine, Paris The Will of the Emperor and the Empire Freedom Among the doctrines put forth by Dante in Monarchia we find a theory according to which the Emperor would grant the highest freedom to human beings (1, XII). My paper analyses the anthropological, psychological, political and theological implications of this theory. I will consider Dante\u2019s utilization of Boethius\u2019 definition of free will ( liberum de voluntate iudicium ), which brings out the following issues: Dante\u2019s position on human freedom, the relation between individual freedom and the will of the Emperor that rules it, the link between the earthly happiness as it takes place in the Empire, and the eternal happiness presented in Paradiso . In addition, I will evaluate the implications of Dante\u2019s position in light of the theological doctrine of charity and its effects, which are peace and concord.  Warren Ginsberg , University of Oregon \u201cFenno una rota di s\u00e9 tutti e trei\u201d: Dialectic, Rhetoric, and History in the Monarchia When Dante contested the papal claim of sovereignty over temporal as well as spiritual matters, he knew he had to back his arguments with all the resources of scientific reasoning. Dialectic, however, was not simply the forma tractandi that his subject demanded and his audience expected. The syllogisms of the Monarchia are intrinsically rhetorical as well; they were the instrument Dante utilized both to stand above his prior political allegiances and to bracket God\u2019s. The forum Dante planned to enter called for a detached disputant bent solely on demonstrating the necessity of his conclusions; he could not, therefore, speak as the champion of Frederick II, as he had in the Convivio . Nor could he decry the wickedness of the Florentines who opposed Henry VII, as he does in the Epistles . Neither could he inveigh against the overreach of a Boniface or a Nicholas, as he had in the Comedy . But the major and minor premises that he deployed in place of more partisan polemical modes underwrite a deeper excision and replacement: the substitution of Rome for Jerusalem as God\u2019s city of peace. Rome, Dante insists, is the fulcrum of providential history, and its Emperor, the Holy Roman Emperor, is the prince Christ has authorized to bring to men of good will the happiness they were meant to enjoy on earth. The thesis I want to explore is that Dante makes logic the voice of history in order to inoculate his interpretation of it against the two most important works that implicitly argue against him. The first, of course, is the De civitate Dei ; Dante knew that many of the figures he presents as proof of the rightness of Rome\u2019s triumph to Augustine were proof of its flaws. The second text is the Bible, specifically the sequence that Dante would have said runs from Judges through Kings. These books, which relate the rise and fall of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, are dominated by two ideal monarchs: one fulfilled God\u2019s will by gathering the twelve tribes into a nation and by establishing wide dominion over many non-believing peoples; the other, given the chance, did not ask God for riches, or power, or honor, or long life, but for the wisdom to govern justly, and was granted so much of it that, \u201cse \ua78cl vero \u00e8 vero,\u201d as Dante says in the Paradiso , his equal has never arisen. In many ways each ruler adumbrates the Emperor and the Empire that Dante says Christianity so desperately wanted. Yet in the Monarchia , David (with one circuitous exception) is not king David, but the psalmist, and Solomon is never king Solomon, only the author of Proverbs .  Francis Hittinger , Columbia University Dante as Critic of Political Economy in the Monarchia   The paper will read Monarchia along with passages reflecting Aristotle\u2019s most developed economic and political thought: Book 1 of the Politics (especially the discussion of oikonomia as chrematistics vs. necessary wealth-getting within a just polity), Books 4 and 5 of the Nicomachean Ethics (on generosity, monetary exchange, and justice), and other loci from the Metaphysics and elsewhere so important for his discussion of economy. These discussions, moreover, are even more revealing when seen within context of the development of Franciscan and Dominican Economic thought of the late 13th and early 14th centuries\u2014such as that of Olivi and Oresme. In sum, the paper will seek to articulate, also by comparison with the main economic and political arguments of the earlier work Convivio (esp. Book 4), how we might come to understand Dante in the Monarchia as a critic of medieval political economy, whose \u2018Aristotelian\u2019 denouncements of greed, monetary accumulation, and their negative effects on society are echoed, centuries later, by modern critics of political economy, chief amongst them Karl Marx.

Even though the Monarchia does not show these references to a corporeal dimension, can scientific auctoritates not be lost but rather absorbed in a new synthesis \u2013 finalized to Dante\u2019s political thought \u2013 where earthly happiness, guaranteed by the actualization of the possible intellect, finds its autonomy?

Essays by Teodolinda Barolini guide the reader through the new verse translations by Richard Lansing, illuminating Dante\u2019s transformation from a young courtly poet into the writer of the vast and visionary Commedia. Barolini\u2019s commentary exposes Dante\u2019s lyric poems as early articulations of many of the ideas in the Commedia, including the philosophy and psychology of desire and its role as motor of all human activity, the quest for vision and transcendence, the frustrating search for justice on earth, and the transgression of boundaries in society and poetry. A wide-ranging and intelligent examination of one of the most important poets in the Western tradition, this book will be of interest to scholars and poetry-lovers alike.
