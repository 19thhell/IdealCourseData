The Fall 2016 application will be available in August. We will post the deadlines by early summer.    NYU Stern is a member of the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management, an alliance of American business schools and top corporations established to enhance diversity in business education and leadership by helping to reduce the serious underrepresentation of African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans in both the member schools\u2019 enrollment and the ranks of management.     We strongly recommend that eligible candidates apply for admission to NYU Stern by using the Consortium application.    Applicants who apply using the Consortium application undergo the same evaluation process as applicants who apply directly to NYU Stern.    MD/MBA, JD/MBA, MBA/MFA, MS in Mathematics/MBA, MBA/MA in French Studies, MBA/MA in Politics and MS in Biology/MBA applicants may not apply to NYU Stern through the Consortium. College seniors who are applying to The William R. Berkley Scholarship Program may not apply through the Consortium.     Applying through the Consortium provides four key benefits:       Consideration for Membership in the Consortium - Consortium members gain access to nearly 100 corporate partners and recruiters and over 5,500 Consortium alumni across 18 member schools. Also, members attend a mandatory five-day Orientation Program (OP) in June prior to beginning the MBA.    Consideration for Consortium Fellowship - Applicants who are admitted through the Consortium process and become Consortium members are considered for this prestigious two-year fellowship covering all tuition and mandatory fees. Consortium applicants also are considered for NYU Stern\u2019s merit-based scholarships.    Common Application - By completing just one application, you can apply to up to six Consortium schools.    Tiered Application Fee - Using the Consortium common application significantly reduces your application fee costs versus applying to each Consortium member school individually.     Stern Interview  After reviewing your application, the Admissions Committee may request an interview. If the Admissions Committee invites you to interview, you will receive the invitation and scheduling information via email. Interviews are by invitation only.    Interviews are conducted in person in New York City. If invited to interview, you should plan on traveling to New York City to interview as part of our application process. All applicants invited to interview will be required to bring an official transcript from each school attended to the interview.    Learn more about the NYU Stern admissions interview process .     Consortium Fellowship/Membership Offers  The Consortium offers full-tuition fellowships and membership to full-time MBA students who demonstrate academic excellence and potential. Consortium Fellows access an extensive network of contacts across partner business schools and businesses.    Applying via the Consortium does not preclude applicants from being awarded other Stern scholarships .     Consortium Orientation Program (OP)  All incoming Consortium members are required to attend The Orientation Program &amp; Career Forum (OP) . This five-day event brings together new Consortium students, second-year students and alumni, as well as representatives from member schools, sponsoring companies and strategic partner organizations and features workshops, social activities, networking opportunities and professional development programming.
