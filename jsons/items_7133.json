For many scholars, the existence of public spaces - the town square, the agora, the rialto, are what makes cities distinctive, but a number of critics have, for at least the last fifty years, been decrying the end of such spaces. This course first examines a number of the classic statements on public space, followed by a close reading and interrogation of the decline of public space theses. Finally, we examine a number of attempts to recapture and reinvigorate public spaces, drawing freely from examples of public art, planning and architecture, and social movements. Among the statements on public space will be selections from classical, democratic, and critical theory, including Aristotle, Arendt, Habermas, De Certeau, and Foucault. Critical contemporary readings on urban space will include Jane Jacobs and selections from urban geographers, sociologists, feminist scholars, and critical race theorists who have engaged the question. The last third of the course, dedicated to rebirths, will include selections and materials from planners and architects, activists and artists who have reflected on the issue while engaging it. Course requirements include student presentations of materials, three short writing assignments, and a final paper on a case of a reimagined public space from NYC.

For many scholars, the existence of public spaces - the town square, the agora, the rialto, are what makes cities distinctive, but a number of critics have, for at least the last fifty years, been decrying the end of such spaces. This course first examines a number of the classic statements on public space, followed by a close reading and interrogation of the decline of public space theses. Finally, we examine a number of attempts to recapture and reinvigorate public spaces, drawing freely from examples of public art, planning and architecture, and social movements. Among the statements on public space will be selections from classical, democratic, and critical theory, including Aristotle, Arendt, Habermas, De Certeau, and Foucault. Critical contemporary readings on urban space will include Jane Jacobs and selections from urban geographers, sociologists, feminist scholars, and critical race theorists who have engaged the question. The last third of the course, dedicated to rebirths, will include selections and materials from planners and architects, activists and artists who have reflected on the issue while engaging it. Course requirements include student presentations of materials, three short writing assignments, and a final paper on a case of a reimagined public space from NYC.

Based on observations, interviews, focus groups, analyses of newspapers, blogs, and other community media, we will learn about the various ways in which people, especially young people, think about, experience, and find meaning in urban environments. By the end of the semester, students will stage a public forum at each site that will prompt an explicit conversation on the topic. Present at the conversation will be experts and community members alike. We will present the findings of our projects to policy makers and public artists identified by the instructor as interested in working in those communities.   The Politics and Anti-Politics of NGOs (Spring 2014) \u00a0   Over the last two decades non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, have played an increasingly active and visible role in international aid, disaster relief, development, post-conflict rebuilding, and local governance. They have received increasing amounts of aid and development dollars, in many cases supplanting more traditional actors, like governments. They have thus provided fodder for exciting and contentious academic and public debates marked by extreme positions: Are NGOs the solution to some of the world\u2019s most difficult problems, or are they Trojan horses for neoliberal reforms? Do they represent a form of global civil society or simply a circulation of elites? This course steps back and offers a broader perspective, by introducing students to the critical analysis of non-governmental organizations and their role in shaping global institutions and domestic political and social change. It locates NGOs within the web of transnational assemblages that they operate in, and pays attention to the experiences and practices of \u201clocal\u201d populations that fall in and out of the category of \u201cclient.\u201d We draw from a range of literatures to inform our analysis: democratic theory around citizenship and civil society; theories of the state; critical studies of development; and analyses of social movements, institutions and global networks. We focus on a few emblematic cases of transnational NGOs and their consequences, including human rights, fair trade, and alter-globalization NGOs.   The Lives, Deaths and Rebirths of Public Space (Fall 2013)   Recent and very visible social movements have reclaimed public spaces in cities around the world, prompting the question of what, exactly, public spaces are and to whom do they (and the cities around them) belong. For many scholars, the existence of public spaces\u2014the town square, the agora, the rialto, are what makes cities distinctive, but a number of critics have, for at least the last fifty years, been decrying the end of such spaces. This course first examines a number of the classic statements on public space, followed by a close reading and interrogation of the decline of public space theses. Finally, we examine a number of attempts to recapture and reinvigorate public spaces, drawing freely from examples of public art, planning and architecture, and social movements. Among the statements on public space will be selections from classical, democratic, and critical theory, including Aristotle, Arendt, Habermas, De Certeau, and Foucault. Critical contemporary readings on urban space will include Jane Jacobs and selections from urban geographers, sociologists, feminist scholars, and critical race theorists who have engaged the question. The last third of the course, dedicated to rebirths, will include selections and materials from planners and architects, activists and artists who have reflected on the issue while engaging it. Course requirements include student presentations of materials, three short writing assignments, and a final paper on a case of a reimagined public space from NYC.   Tools for Social Change (Fall 2013)   This course serves as the anchor for community-engaged course work at Gallatin. It complements the range of course offerings at Gallatin and NYU by focusing on connection between theories of social change and the practice of social change. This course thus gives students a platform to question and start defining their roles in social change, through readings, case studies, conversations with activists, and reflection exercises. Tools for Social Change is a course for proactive, humble-yet-ambitious students who are motivated to engage deeply with the challenges of this course work. This hands-on course will help students make important decisions about their own values and belief systems, and figure out how to put those into practice. Students will then reflect on the experience in the form of small writing exercises and a final project. Guest speakers will include activists from local organizations and former Gallatin students who have gone on to pursue activism. Readings will include a range of \u201cclassic\u201d and more contemporary texts on the connection between critical theories and practice, including: Paulo Freire, Martin Luther King, Cornel West, Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9, among others.
