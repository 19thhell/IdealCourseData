Can urban planning now be used to reverse this?      Since the demise of Apartheid, South Africa has largely been recognized as a bastion of democracy, human rights, and development. Hosting international events like the 2010 World Cup, it is regularly heralded as a success story that often masks a more complex reality. South Africa has one of the world&#39;s highest levels of income inequality, and its cites remain some of the worlds most spatially and socially divided. More than ten million people live without adequate access to sanitation, unemployment hovers at around 40%, and violent crime is rife. At the same time, South Africa&#39;s unique history of activism and public engagement provides hope for positive change.      Gavin Silber and James Leyba, current Wagner MUP Candidates, will discuss urbanization in South Africa, the challenges and opportunities it presents, and some of the initiatives underway at the grassroots level to prompt more equitable and effective urban development.      Gavin spent ten years, before coming to Wagner, in South Africa working in various social justice organizations. Most recently, he lead the Social Justice Coalition - a social movement based in Cape Town campaigning for improved conditions in informal settlements.      James spent this past summer in Cape Town working at Ndifuna Ukwazi - an advocacy and research group exploring spatial inequality and land use in South Africa.

Twenty years ago, the world celebrated South Africa\u2019s swift transition from apartheid to democracy in 1994.\u00a0 The late Nelson Mandela brought wisdom and magnanimity to the office of president.\u00a0 The hearings before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission exposed the cruelty of racism and wrongdoings by all parties.\u00a0 But the fairytale ending collided with high expectations abroad and deep problems at home over race, poverty, inequality, AIDS, high unemployment and crime.\u00a0 In the years since apartheid\u2019s end, South Africans have struggled to transform their society.\u00a0 This course is designed to explore the challenges they face in politics, justice, economics, regional ties and social needs.\u00a0 We will look at the remaking of the political system, accountability when one party dominates, and South Africa\u2019s role on the continent.\u00a0 We will discuss the continuing and sometimes clashing quests for justice and for reconciliation, as well as the country\u2019s current soaring rate of violent crime.\u00a0 We will examine the issues of widespread poverty, economic empowerment, and regional economic dominance.\u00a0 And we will probe some of the major social concerns, including the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the status of women, jobless youth, education shortfalls, land reform, and rising immigration.
