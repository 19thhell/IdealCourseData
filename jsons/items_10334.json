By developing seminars and workshops that examine the history of these configurations, the Institute also supports experiments with new constellations of subject matters and texts, innovative methodologies, and interrogations of existing departmental and divisional organization within this and other universities.

Because no range of seminars could possibly exhaust the topics related to this enterprise, the Institute offers no set curriculum. Instead, the Institute offers graduate seminars, the subjects of which vary from term to term. These seminars treat topics related to knowledge-production in general.      The Institute\u2019s mandate is to enhance the graduate curriculum with original courses that would not ordinarily find a place in established departments. In this capacity, IHPK faculty work collaboratively with faculty in other departments and programs to develop and offer innovative courses that examine topics in the production and organization of knowledge. All courses developed by Institute faculty are then formally sponsored by, or cross-listed, with appropriate NYU departments and programs as topical seminars.
