She is the Director of the\u00a0 University of Michigan Autism and Communications Disorders Center , Ann Arbor.\u00a0 Dr. Lord specializes in the diagnosis, and intervention in Autism Spectrum Disorders.\u00a0 She is renowned for her work in longitudinal studies of children with Autism as well as for her role in developing autism diagnostic instruments used in both practice and in research worldwide. \u00a0Dr. Lord is a sought-after speaker and advisor on social and communication development in children.   To learn more about Dr. Lord\u2019s views on the diagnosis and treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and to learn more about promising research about Autism, she was interviewed by\u00a0Anita Gurian, Ph.D., Senior Content Editor of AboutOurKids.org.   What are the early signs of Autism?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 One early sign that doesn\u2019t occur in all children, but is probably the clearest early sign, is when a child seems to lose interest in social interaction - like a child who was very responsive and would smile when he looked at his parents, and then over the course of a month or so gradually doesn\u2019t smile back when the parents smile at him. \u00a0The child may be really happy and may be smiling but not in response to an interaction with his parents.   There are other early signs:\u00a0If a child develops a few words (usually fewer than 10, but sometimes more), such as\u00a0 bottle\u00a0 or\u00a0 baby\u00a0 or\u00a0 dog , and uses them appropriately but gradually uses them less and less.\u00a0 Also, if a child doesn\u2019t respond to his name by the time he\u2019s a year or 14 months; if a child is really very quiet; if a child does really odd things with objects in the same way over and over again; if a child doesn\u2019t approach the parents to point and show them things, doesn\u2019t want to get the parents to look at the moon, a fire engine, or share something special, like showing their new shoes or a toy, this is often meaningful.\u00a0 Those kinds of signs are the most important, but really clear signs tend to not occur in most children with Autism. We have to be very careful because any one of these things doesn\u2019t mean Autism   At what age can Autism be diagnosed?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 Sometimes there are signs before age two, but I think that Autism can be diagnosed definitively at age two.\u00a0 We have to be really careful because we know that children who can be diagnosed between age\u00a0two and two and a half will very likely have an Autism diagnosis throughout their lives. \u00a0There are kids who at 12 months or 15 months seem to have signs of Autism, and then by age\u00a0two or\u00a0three they don\u2019t, and there are kids who don\u2019t show signs of Autism until later.\u00a0 It\u2019s clear that kids who have Autism don\u2019t look that different from other kids until they\u2019re between 12 and l8 months which is why a comprehensive diagnosis is best made at\u00a0two years old.The brain is constantly evolving from infancy through childhood through adolescence.   Can Autism be outgrown?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0There are some lucky, probably very bright, children who gradually seem to grow out of the disorder; but that number is pretty small and under age two we just don\u2019t know.\u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s clear that some kind of compensation occurs. When you look at the studies about brain activation, it turns out that if you show someone a smiling face most of us will have a certain area of our brain that activates, and people with Autism have all sorts of other areas that activate. \u00a0So it\u2019s not that they all have this other area, it\u2019s that their brain has worked out different ways of responding to that stimulus.   Are there specific criteria that will determine if a very young child has Autism?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0We\u2019ve developed a diagnostic instrument for really young kids (ADOS, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule). This instrument consists of a series of ways for an evaluator to play with a child to observe his or her social behavior and communication. \u00a0We present ten different tasks over a period of about 45 minutes with the parents present, so you can involve them. What we do is to create certain situations and challenges where almost every child will look at a person \u2013 so, for example, if a child is playing and using some object and you put your hand smack in the way of what they\u2019re doing so they can\u2019t do it any more, most kids will wonder what\u2019s happening and will look at you or their parents. Children with Autism won\u2019t. \u00a0We \u00a0present those kinds of small challenges, such as just ignoring the child.\u00a0 Most children are not happy being ignored for very long and will come to you and try to get you involved in what they\u2019re doing, but a child with Autism may not even notice. We can get good\u00a0agreement between the scores and the clinician\u2019s impressions of what the child is like now, and although the stability of those scores is\u00a0far better than chance and better than the clinician\u2019s impression, they still change a whole lot more than they would if you give the same instrument a year later.   Are early interventions the most effective?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0\u00a0 We really hope so.\u00a0 We don\u2019t really have proof that that\u2019s the case. There are a few studies that suggest that kids who start interventions at\u00a0three or\u00a0four do better than those who start interventions at\u00a0five or six.\u00a0 The big hope is that we can have social interventions with really small kids, so then we can keep them in a more normal social environment.   Are more interventions for young children being developed?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0New intervention techniques are starting to be developed.\u00a0 However, really young kids are usually identified as having language problems; they don\u2019t often get identified as having ASD.\u00a0 People want to believe the language diagnosis very much, which is understandable.\u00a0 So we haven\u2019t seen many very little children, and most of the little ones we see have been identified by their own parents, who\u2019ve been concerned about their child\u2019s unusual behavior and have gone to their pediatrician.\u00a0 Hopefully, the pediatrician then refers them to clinicians with this training.   What about adolescents or young adults whose difficulties may not have been identified at an earlier age?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 \u00a0It would be very rare if adolescents and young adults with ASD didn\u2019t have problems earlier in life, but their problems may have been diagnosed as ADHD, or anxiety disorder, or a non-verbal learning disability, or oppositional behavior.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have these problems, but they have ASD as well, or the other problems may be a consequence of ASD.\u00a0 The main signs for adolescents and young adults with ASD are usually social deficits, not understanding how people interact, often not ever having had a friend, not understanding what relationships are about. Adolescents and young adults really want social contacts; it\u2019s not that they\u2019re aloof and don\u2019t care. They just don\u2019t quite get it; they don\u2019t quite understand the back and forth of interactions.\u00a0 The other hard reality for an adolescent is that their parents can\u2019t be their life.\u00a0 With a two-year-old, parents can do amazing things and can make their child happy \u2013 but, with an adolescent parents can take them to a movie, but can\u2019t make them happy. \u00a0By far the best organized services\u00a0now are for preschool kids \u2013 this is a time when parents are in charge;\u00a0 for example, parents can get their kids to preschool and can be home at certain times so early intervention specialists can come to their homes to work with the child and the parents or caregivers.\u00a0\u00a0 Parents, however, can\u2019t be involved in that way with eighteen-year-olds. So we have to rethink services for adolescents.   Since the identified number of cases of Autism has been increasing, do you think we\u2019re seeing an epidemic?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing an epidemic.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re getting better and better at diagnosing and the diagnostic criteria are broader.   Which treatments have been proven effective?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0At this point the effective treatments are behavioral in the sense that we\u2019re teaching children how to behave.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of evidence that treatments based on operant learning \u2013 if you do this then this happens; when I hold this up, you say this -\u00a0are effective.\u00a0 However, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for different children \u2013 some need very structured teaching and others less structured teaching. The reality is that knowing what this child is really good at is just as important as the diagnosis. One child may be incredible at puzzles and not good at understanding language.\u00a0 We do know that if you leave it to the child and totally follow the child\u2019s lead, there\u2019s no evidence that you\u2019re going to get anywhere.\u00a0 Very good therapists and teachers may do incredible things with certain children, but when we actually look at what they do it\u2019s not that different than loose behavioral treatment.\u00a0 The therapist is \u00a0trying to figure out what the child wants to do, set goals within the child\u2019s reach, build on that, make it a positive experience and then incorporate it into social behavior.   Are there treatments that have made grand claims but have turned out not to be effective?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 There\u2019s one every year \u2013 I think the most conspicuous has been secretin, in which a pig hormone is used.\u00a0 When someone reported that a child who was treated with secretin was cured, then people were buying it, physicians were selling it, but when NIH funded a slew of clinical trials it showed that it did nothing. The biggest pitch right now is hyperbaric oxygen.   Is there a causal relationship between vaccines and Autism?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0We could never say for an individual child that immunization didn\u2019t affect the brain.\u00a0\u00a0 But the connection that the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) injection or mercury causes Autism is just completely disproven; there\u2019s not one iota of truth in it.\u00a0 The logic was that people who have mercury poisoning sort of looked like kids with Autism.\u00a0 All of the public health data show there\u2019s just no relation to Autism.\u00a0 I think that the fact that most kids with Autism do lose social skills in the second year of life is a tragic phenomenon, and for parents it\u2019s just irresistible not to make a connection and associate that with other things, like vaccines, that happened during that time.   What are the promising leads in current research?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0There\u2019s been a lot of interest in looking at brain functions during social tasks and looking at the brain in a resting state, so that\u2019s one good focus; what will come of it we really don\u2019t know. \u00a0Also, I think we\u2019re getting more sophisticated; initially researchers were looking at the activation of different areas of the brain, and now there\u2019s a lot of interest in biological motion -- the idea that if we look at a face, what\u2019s important is not just seeing the configuration but how people move and how people move differently than flies or monkeys. Researchers usually have their own favorite brain region \u2013 the midbrain, the cortex, the cerebellum.\u00a0 I think what\u2019s vital but hard is how you put that information together, something that\u00a0 Dr. Xavier Castellanos\u00a0 at the NYU Child Study Center is interested in doing.\u00a0 In his work he also gets information from typical kids about different regions of the brain and then can make comparisons.   What\u2019s the focus of current research in genetics?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 Genetically there\u2019s almost an overabundance of research right now because of the technology.\u00a0 Researchers are finding many specific abnormalities, but what we don\u2019t know yet is whether these abnormalities are just linked to Autism or are they linked to risks for many things?\u00a0 They\u2019re thought to be more common in Autism than in the ordinary population, but it also seems like they\u2019re often more common in ADHD or in Schizophrenia or in other disorders.   Autism at the present time is totally dependent on a behavioral diagnosis. Some geneticists stress the importance of being able to identify Autism biologically. If we can start with Fragile X or Tuberous Sclerosis or 15Q111 Gene Deletion we can then say whoever has this condition has Autism- you can look at the differences and ask questions. Is it that the kids who have Fragile X and Autism are the kids who are more severely\u00a0intellectually disabled\u00a0or that the kids who also have these other six genes \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of interest in that.\u00a0 Then we might be able to come up with a medical treatment even if we don\u2019t know exactly what causes the syndrome.   The current administration will make funding for ASD available - where would you like to see it go?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0I would like to see it go to developing services for older kids, adolescents and adults.\u00a0 I think money should go to things that fall between the cracks, like coordination of medical, educational, and community services. I think we need more treatment research, but it\u2019s very expensive and hard to do. We need big studies across multiple sites, we need control groups, and we need people getting different kinds of treatment.\u00a0 We also need to work across disciplines, for example, teaming up people who know job training work with people who know about Autism.   What do you think are the major accomplishments of the past several years?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 I do think that things are better, that kids are identified earlier, that they\u2019re getting more services, and that the world understands more about Autism.\u00a0 Services are more available and eventually lead to access to regular schools and jobs for some. I think we\u2019re in a much better position to compare results of research, because we at least agree about who has Autism and who doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 So these aspects have gotten better and have allowed people to communicate much better across disciplines. In terms of the lives of kids, I think that kids who have Autism but do not have intellectual disabilities and who have good mainstream schooling are really in a better position, at least coming out of high school. I think being with ordinary children and seeing how they behave is a radically different life experience than being in a separate school system their whole life, so I think that\u2019s better.   Have your interests and your work focused mainly on the younger kids?

She is the Director of the\u00a0 University of Michigan Autism and Communications Disorders Center , Ann Arbor.\u00a0 Dr. Lord specializes in the diagnosis, and intervention in Autism Spectrum Disorders.\u00a0 She is renowned for her work in longitudinal studies of children with Autism as well as for her role in developing autism diagnostic instruments used in both practice and in research worldwide. \u00a0Dr. Lord is a sought-after speaker and advisor on social and communication development in children.   To learn more about Dr. Lord\u2019s views on the diagnosis and treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and to learn more about promising research about Autism, she was interviewed by\u00a0Anita Gurian, Ph.D., Senior Content Editor of AboutOurKids.org.   What are the early signs of Autism?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 One early sign that doesn\u2019t occur in all children, but is probably the clearest early sign, is when a child seems to lose interest in social interaction - like a child who was very responsive and would smile when he looked at his parents, and then over the course of a month or so gradually doesn\u2019t smile back when the parents smile at him. \u00a0The child may be really happy and may be smiling but not in response to an interaction with his parents.   There are other early signs:\u00a0If a child develops a few words (usually fewer than 10, but sometimes more), such as\u00a0 bottle\u00a0 or\u00a0 baby\u00a0 or\u00a0 dog , and uses them appropriately but gradually uses them less and less.\u00a0 Also, if a child doesn\u2019t respond to his name by the time he\u2019s a year or 14 months; if a child is really very quiet; if a child does really odd things with objects in the same way over and over again; if a child doesn\u2019t approach the parents to point and show them things, doesn\u2019t want to get the parents to look at the moon, a fire engine, or share something special, like showing their new shoes or a toy, this is often meaningful.\u00a0 Those kinds of signs are the most important, but really clear signs tend to not occur in most children with Autism. We have to be very careful because any one of these things doesn\u2019t mean Autism   At what age can Autism be diagnosed?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 Sometimes there are signs before age two, but I think that Autism can be diagnosed definitively at age two.\u00a0 We have to be really careful because we know that children who can be diagnosed between age\u00a0two and two and a half will very likely have an Autism diagnosis throughout their lives. \u00a0There are kids who at 12 months or 15 months seem to have signs of Autism, and then by age\u00a0two or\u00a0three they don\u2019t, and there are kids who don\u2019t show signs of Autism until later.\u00a0 It\u2019s clear that kids who have Autism don\u2019t look that different from other kids until they\u2019re between 12 and l8 months which is why a comprehensive diagnosis is best made at\u00a0two years old.The brain is constantly evolving from infancy through childhood through adolescence.   Can Autism be outgrown?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0There are some lucky, probably very bright, children who gradually seem to grow out of the disorder; but that number is pretty small and under age two we just don\u2019t know.\u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s clear that some kind of compensation occurs. When you look at the studies about brain activation, it turns out that if you show someone a smiling face most of us will have a certain area of our brain that activates, and people with Autism have all sorts of other areas that activate. \u00a0So it\u2019s not that they all have this other area, it\u2019s that their brain has worked out different ways of responding to that stimulus.   Are there specific criteria that will determine if a very young child has Autism?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0We\u2019ve developed a diagnostic instrument for really young kids (ADOS, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule). This instrument consists of a series of ways for an evaluator to play with a child to observe his or her social behavior and communication. \u00a0We present ten different tasks over a period of about 45 minutes with the parents present, so you can involve them. What we do is to create certain situations and challenges where almost every child will look at a person \u2013 so, for example, if a child is playing and using some object and you put your hand smack in the way of what they\u2019re doing so they can\u2019t do it any more, most kids will wonder what\u2019s happening and will look at you or their parents. Children with Autism won\u2019t. \u00a0We \u00a0present those kinds of small challenges, such as just ignoring the child.\u00a0 Most children are not happy being ignored for very long and will come to you and try to get you involved in what they\u2019re doing, but a child with Autism may not even notice. We can get good\u00a0agreement between the scores and the clinician\u2019s impressions of what the child is like now, and although the stability of those scores is\u00a0far better than chance and better than the clinician\u2019s impression, they still change a whole lot more than they would if you give the same instrument a year later.   Are early interventions the most effective?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0\u00a0 We really hope so.\u00a0 We don\u2019t really have proof that that\u2019s the case. There are a few studies that suggest that kids who start interventions at\u00a0three or\u00a0four do better than those who start interventions at\u00a0five or six.\u00a0 The big hope is that we can have social interventions with really small kids, so then we can keep them in a more normal social environment.   Are more interventions for young children being developed?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0New intervention techniques are starting to be developed.\u00a0 However, really young kids are usually identified as having language problems; they don\u2019t often get identified as having ASD.\u00a0 People want to believe the language diagnosis very much, which is understandable.\u00a0 So we haven\u2019t seen many very little children, and most of the little ones we see have been identified by their own parents, who\u2019ve been concerned about their child\u2019s unusual behavior and have gone to their pediatrician.\u00a0 Hopefully, the pediatrician then refers them to clinicians with this training.   What about adolescents or young adults whose difficulties may not have been identified at an earlier age?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 \u00a0It would be very rare if adolescents and young adults with ASD didn\u2019t have problems earlier in life, but their problems may have been diagnosed as ADHD, or anxiety disorder, or a non-verbal learning disability, or oppositional behavior.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have these problems, but they have ASD as well, or the other problems may be a consequence of ASD.\u00a0 The main signs for adolescents and young adults with ASD are usually social deficits, not understanding how people interact, often not ever having had a friend, not understanding what relationships are about. Adolescents and young adults really want social contacts; it\u2019s not that they\u2019re aloof and don\u2019t care. They just don\u2019t quite get it; they don\u2019t quite understand the back and forth of interactions.\u00a0 The other hard reality for an adolescent is that their parents can\u2019t be their life.\u00a0 With a two-year-old, parents can do amazing things and can make their child happy \u2013 but, with an adolescent parents can take them to a movie, but can\u2019t make them happy. \u00a0By far the best organized services\u00a0now are for preschool kids \u2013 this is a time when parents are in charge;\u00a0 for example, parents can get their kids to preschool and can be home at certain times so early intervention specialists can come to their homes to work with the child and the parents or caregivers.\u00a0\u00a0 Parents, however, can\u2019t be involved in that way with eighteen-year-olds. So we have to rethink services for adolescents.   Since the identified number of cases of Autism has been increasing, do you think we\u2019re seeing an epidemic?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing an epidemic.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re getting better and better at diagnosing and the diagnostic criteria are broader.   Which treatments have been proven effective?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0At this point the effective treatments are behavioral in the sense that we\u2019re teaching children how to behave.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of evidence that treatments based on operant learning \u2013 if you do this then this happens; when I hold this up, you say this -\u00a0are effective.\u00a0 However, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for different children \u2013 some need very structured teaching and others less structured teaching. The reality is that knowing what this child is really good at is just as important as the diagnosis. One child may be incredible at puzzles and not good at understanding language.\u00a0 We do know that if you leave it to the child and totally follow the child\u2019s lead, there\u2019s no evidence that you\u2019re going to get anywhere.\u00a0 Very good therapists and teachers may do incredible things with certain children, but when we actually look at what they do it\u2019s not that different than loose behavioral treatment.\u00a0 The therapist is \u00a0trying to figure out what the child wants to do, set goals within the child\u2019s reach, build on that, make it a positive experience and then incorporate it into social behavior.   Are there treatments that have made grand claims but have turned out not to be effective?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 There\u2019s one every year \u2013 I think the most conspicuous has been secretin, in which a pig hormone is used.\u00a0 When someone reported that a child who was treated with secretin was cured, then people were buying it, physicians were selling it, but when NIH funded a slew of clinical trials it showed that it did nothing. The biggest pitch right now is hyperbaric oxygen.   Is there a causal relationship between vaccines and Autism?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0We could never say for an individual child that immunization didn\u2019t affect the brain.\u00a0\u00a0 But the connection that the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) injection or mercury causes Autism is just completely disproven; there\u2019s not one iota of truth in it.\u00a0 The logic was that people who have mercury poisoning sort of looked like kids with Autism.\u00a0 All of the public health data show there\u2019s just no relation to Autism.\u00a0 I think that the fact that most kids with Autism do lose social skills in the second year of life is a tragic phenomenon, and for parents it\u2019s just irresistible not to make a connection and associate that with other things, like vaccines, that happened during that time.   What are the promising leads in current research?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0There\u2019s been a lot of interest in looking at brain functions during social tasks and looking at the brain in a resting state, so that\u2019s one good focus; what will come of it we really don\u2019t know. \u00a0Also, I think we\u2019re getting more sophisticated; initially researchers were looking at the activation of different areas of the brain, and now there\u2019s a lot of interest in biological motion -- the idea that if we look at a face, what\u2019s important is not just seeing the configuration but how people move and how people move differently than flies or monkeys. Researchers usually have their own favorite brain region \u2013 the midbrain, the cortex, the cerebellum.\u00a0 I think what\u2019s vital but hard is how you put that information together, something that\u00a0 Dr. Xavier Castellanos\u00a0 at the NYU Child Study Center is interested in doing.\u00a0 In his work he also gets information from typical kids about different regions of the brain and then can make comparisons.   What\u2019s the focus of current research in genetics?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 Genetically there\u2019s almost an overabundance of research right now because of the technology.\u00a0 Researchers are finding many specific abnormalities, but what we don\u2019t know yet is whether these abnormalities are just linked to Autism or are they linked to risks for many things?\u00a0 They\u2019re thought to be more common in Autism than in the ordinary population, but it also seems like they\u2019re often more common in ADHD or in Schizophrenia or in other disorders.   Autism at the present time is totally dependent on a behavioral diagnosis. Some geneticists stress the importance of being able to identify Autism biologically. If we can start with Fragile X or Tuberous Sclerosis or 15Q111 Gene Deletion we can then say whoever has this condition has Autism- you can look at the differences and ask questions. Is it that the kids who have Fragile X and Autism are the kids who are more severely\u00a0intellectually disabled\u00a0or that the kids who also have these other six genes \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of interest in that.\u00a0 Then we might be able to come up with a medical treatment even if we don\u2019t know exactly what causes the syndrome.   The current administration will make funding for ASD available - where would you like to see it go?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0I would like to see it go to developing services for older kids, adolescents and adults.\u00a0 I think money should go to things that fall between the cracks, like coordination of medical, educational, and community services. I think we need more treatment research, but it\u2019s very expensive and hard to do. We need big studies across multiple sites, we need control groups, and we need people getting different kinds of treatment.\u00a0 We also need to work across disciplines, for example, teaming up people who know job training work with people who know about Autism.   What do you think are the major accomplishments of the past several years?   Dr. Lord: \u00a0 I do think that things are better, that kids are identified earlier, that they\u2019re getting more services, and that the world understands more about Autism.\u00a0 Services are more available and eventually lead to access to regular schools and jobs for some. I think we\u2019re in a much better position to compare results of research, because we at least agree about who has Autism and who doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 So these aspects have gotten better and have allowed people to communicate much better across disciplines. In terms of the lives of kids, I think that kids who have Autism but do not have intellectual disabilities and who have good mainstream schooling are really in a better position, at least coming out of high school. I think being with ordinary children and seeing how they behave is a radically different life experience than being in a separate school system their whole life, so I think that\u2019s better.   Have your interests and your work focused mainly on the younger kids?   Dr. Lord:\u00a0 \u00a0Well, I\u2019ve been interested in the whole range, including adult services.\u00a0 I think it depends on where I am.\u00a0 If I\u2019m with a group of parents with children of a specific age I try to figure out what we can do for that age.\u00a0 So I\u2019ve done a little bit of everything.\u00a0 I\u2019ve also been following a group of 200 kids since they were 2; they\u2019re now l7 to 20.\u00a0 I\u2019m interested in what they were like when they were two, but I\u2019m also very interested in what they\u2019re like now, how got there and what paths they took, and what can we learn from them that we can put to use.   I think this is a hopeful time, that encouraging things are happening on multiple fronts \u2013 new research paths, new treatments and new prevention strategies are being developed.
