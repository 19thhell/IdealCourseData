The GovLab aims to improve people's lives by changing how we govern.   Description   The GovLab is an action research center seeking new ways to solve public problems using advances in technology and science. Our goal is to advance our understanding of how 21st century citizen engagement can make governance more effective and legitimate.   The GovLab\u2019s work is predicated on the following hypotheses:   Institutions that govern themselves more collaboratively solve problems faster and with greater success; and   Greater engagement leads to more legitimate democratic governance and also to better solutions for citizens.   Rather than working like a traditional academic research organization, the GovLab resembles a technology start up, rapidly evolving in response to research results, individual project needs or emergent trends. In all of its initiatives, the GovLab employs an \"action research\" approach. The GovLab develops practical designs for processes, technologies and institutional arrangements to support collaborative democracy; puts these designs into practice; studies the outcomes to advance our understanding; and uses that understanding to design the next projects. The organization produces scholarly research and maps real-world developments to create a robust understanding of how scientific and technological advances can improve 21st-century governance. A focus on real-world impacts and evidence-based decisionmaking defines the GovLab approach and ensures that its actions are legitimate and credible.\u00a0   Activities   The GovLab has four major lines of activities that are responsible for its research, communication and teaching and training functions. The GovLab's work encompasses:   Research Network: Develops and uses an interdisciplinary network, holds convenings to deepen the research agenda and refines our understanding of new governance models.   Living Labs:\u00a0 Partners with real-world institutions to conduct action-research experiments to test what works in practice and measure impact.   Observatory: Shares what we and others have learned from both empirical work and theoretical reflection across disciplines.   Academy:\u00a0 Serves as a free online community for those interested in teaching and learning about collaborative strategies to solve public problems.\u00a0                       Visit the GovLab Website   Contact Us   Stefaan Verhulst, Chief of Research  E-mail:\u00a0 sverhulst@nyu.edu  Website:\u00a0 http://thegovlab.org/                                   News/In the Press                          08/19/2014      Technology&#039;s Crucial Role in the Fight Against Hunger \u2013 Beth Noveck in Governing      Technology&#039;s Crucial Role in the Fight Against Hunger      Press           03/31/2014      Open Data Odyssey \u2013 The GovLab in Computerworld      Open Data Odyssey      Press                         More News                                  Blogs | Tweets                                                 The GovLab      @TheGovLab         Follow @TheGovLab       I added a video to a @YouTube playlist t.co/sboMmeip6n The story of the Open Source Drug Discovery project         9 min 15 sec ago.

The GovLab aims to improve people's lives by changing how we govern.   Description   The GovLab is an action research center seeking new ways to solve public problems using advances in technology and science. Our goal is to advance our understanding of how 21st century citizen engagement can make governance more effective and legitimate.   The GovLab\u2019s work is predicated on the following hypotheses:   Institutions that govern themselves more collaboratively solve problems faster and with greater success; and   Greater engagement leads to more legitimate democratic governance and also to better solutions for citizens.   Rather than working like a traditional academic research organization, the GovLab resembles a technology start up, rapidly evolving in response to research results, individual project needs or emergent trends. In all of its initiatives, the GovLab employs an \"action research\" approach. The GovLab develops practical designs for processes, technologies and institutional arrangements to support collaborative democracy; puts these designs into practice; studies the outcomes to advance our understanding; and uses that understanding to design the next projects. The organization produces scholarly research and maps real-world developments to create a robust understanding of how scientific and technological advances can improve 21st-century governance. A focus on real-world impacts and evidence-based decisionmaking defines the GovLab approach and ensures that its actions are legitimate and credible.\u00a0   Activities   The GovLab has four major lines of activities that are responsible for its research, communication and teaching and training functions. The GovLab's work encompasses:   Research Network: Develops and uses an interdisciplinary network, holds convenings to deepen the research agenda and refines our understanding of new governance models.   Living Labs:\u00a0 Partners with real-world institutions to conduct action-research experiments to test what works in practice and measure impact.   Observatory: Shares what we and others have learned from both empirical work and theoretical reflection across disciplines.   Academy:\u00a0 Serves as a free online community for those interested in teaching and learning about collaborative strategies to solve public problems.\u00a0                       Visit the GovLab Website   Contact Us   Stefaan Verhulst, Chief of Research  E-mail:\u00a0 sverhulst@nyu.edu  Website:\u00a0 http://thegovlab.org/                                   News/In the Press                          08/19/2014      Technology&#039;s Crucial Role in the Fight Against Hunger \u2013 Beth Noveck in Governing      Technology&#039;s Crucial Role in the Fight Against Hunger      Press           03/31/2014      Open Data Odyssey \u2013 The GovLab in Computerworld      Open Data Odyssey      Press                         More News                                  Blogs | Tweets                                                 The GovLab      @TheGovLab         Follow @TheGovLab       I added a video to a @YouTube playlist t.co/sboMmeip6n The story of the Open Source Drug Discovery project         9 min 15 sec ago.
