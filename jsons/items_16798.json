Burrows     SHERP Founder and Director Emeritus     Bill Burrows (alias \"Mom\" to SHERPies) received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Columbia University. Having reported for The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Bill has a rich and varied background in print reporting. Bill also has had articles in The New York Times Magazine, Foreign Affairs, The Sciences, Harvard Magazine and Harper's, and is a contributing editor for Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian. He is the author of eleven books: Richthofen: A True History Of The Red Baron (1969); Vigilante (1976); On Reporting The News (1977); Deep Black: Space Espionage And National Security (1987); Exploring Space: Voyages In The Solar System And Beyond (1990); Critical Mass: The Dangerous Race For Superweapons In A Fragmenting World (with Robert Windrem)(1993); Mission To Deep Black: Voyager's Journey Of Discovery (1993); This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age (1998); The Infinite Journey: Eyewitness Accounts of NASA and the Age of Space (2000); By Any Means Necessary: America's Secret Air War in the Cold War (2001); and his latest, The Survival Imperative: Using Space to Protect Earth (2006). This New Ocean, considered the definitive single-volume history of the space age, was one of three finalists for the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for History and also won the American Astronautical Society's Eugene M. Emme award for astronautical literature. Recently, the International Astronomical Union named the minor planet (aka asteroid) #9930 \"Billburrows.\" Bill points out that since #9930 is not an Earth-crosser, Billburrows will never wipe out Bill Burrows. \"It would be absolutely appropriate, of course, if it is shaped like a colossal martini olive,\" he adds.

Burrows     SHERP Founder and Director Emeritus     Bill Burrows (alias \"Mom\" to SHERPies) received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Columbia University. Having reported for The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Bill has a rich and varied background in print reporting. Bill also has had articles in The New York Times Magazine, Foreign Affairs, The Sciences, Harvard Magazine and Harper's, and is a contributing editor for Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian. He is the author of eleven books: Richthofen: A True History Of The Red Baron (1969); Vigilante (1976); On Reporting The News (1977); Deep Black: Space Espionage And National Security (1987); Exploring Space: Voyages In The Solar System And Beyond (1990); Critical Mass: The Dangerous Race For Superweapons In A Fragmenting World (with Robert Windrem)(1993); Mission To Deep Black: Voyager's Journey Of Discovery (1993); This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age (1998); The Infinite Journey: Eyewitness Accounts of NASA and the Age of Space (2000); By Any Means Necessary: America's Secret Air War in the Cold War (2001); and his latest, The Survival Imperative: Using Space to Protect Earth (2006). This New Ocean, considered the definitive single-volume history of the space age, was one of three finalists for the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for History and also won the American Astronautical Society's Eugene M. Emme award for astronautical literature. Recently, the International Astronomical Union named the minor planet (aka asteroid) #9930 \"Billburrows.\" Bill points out that since #9930 is not an Earth-crosser, Billburrows will never wipe out Bill Burrows. \"It would be absolutely appropriate, of course, if it is shaped like a colossal martini olive,\" he adds.

The Machine Age, Automobile Age, Space Age, and Information Age were among the most important trends. Each innovation inspired new urban visions, such as Howard\u2019s Garden City, Wright\u2019s Broadacre City, Archigram\u2019s Instant City, and Fuller\u2019s Domed Manhattan. Films like Blade Runner and Metropolis provided critical visions of culture and environment. Though none of these designs produced real roadmaps for the future, each contained interesting ideas. In the 21st century, architects and planners entered a new Environmental Era that introduced concepts like green design and planning, recycling and alternative energy to support sustainable development. This workshop explores new techniques of green architecture and planning through films, readings and lectures on cities worldwide. Using New York as a prototype, it also examines the evolution of urban transportation, land use, and social and environmental planning. Students develop several types of projects, such as the design of a green structure, the planning analysis of a park or neighborhood in maps and diagrams, and a photographic essay on an urban issue. No experience is necessary, but students will need drawing tools and a camera.

The Machine Age, the Automobile Age, the Space Age, and the Information Age were among the important trends. Each innovation inspired new urban visions, such as Howard\u2019s Garden City, Wright\u2019s Broadacre City, Archigram\u2019s Instant City, and Fuller\u2019s Domed Manhattan. Films like Metropolis , Brazil , and Blade Runner provided critical visions. None of these designs produced real roadmaps for the future, but each contained interesting ideas. In the 21st century, architects and planners entered a new Environmental Era that introduced alternative energy, infrastructure, design, and planning to support sustainable development. This workshop explores new techniques in green architecture, landscape, art, and urban planning through films, readings, and lectures on cities worldwide. Using New York as a prototype, it also examines the evolution of urban transportation, land use, and social and environmental planning. Students develop several types of projects, such as the design of a green structure or roof terrace; planning analysis of a park or neighborhood in maps and diagrams, or a photographic essay on an urban issue. No experience is necessary, but students will need drawing tools and a camera.

Burrows     SHERP Founder and Director Emeritus     Bill Burrows (alias \"Mom\" to SHERPies) received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Columbia University. Having reported for The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Bill has a rich and varied background in print reporting. Bill also has had articles in The New York Times Magazine, Foreign Affairs, The Sciences, Harvard Magazine and Harper's, and is a contributing editor for Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian. He is the author of eleven books: Richthofen: A True History Of The Red Baron (1969); Vigilante (1976); On Reporting The News (1977); Deep Black: Space Espionage And National Security (1987); Exploring Space: Voyages In The Solar System And Beyond (1990); Critical Mass: The Dangerous Race For Superweapons In A Fragmenting World (with Robert Windrem)(1993); Mission To Deep Black: Voyager's Journey Of Discovery (1993); This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age (1998); The Infinite Journey: Eyewitness Accounts of NASA and the Age of Space (2000); By Any Means Necessary: America's Secret Air War in the Cold War (2001); and his latest, The Survival Imperative: Using Space to Protect Earth (2006). This New Ocean, considered the definitive single-volume history of the space age, was one of three finalists for the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for History and also won the American Astronautical Society's Eugene M. Emme award for astronautical literature. Recently, the International Astronomical Union named the minor planet (aka asteroid) #9930 \"Billburrows.\" Bill points out that since #9930 is not an Earth-crosser, Billburrows will never wipe out Bill Burrows. \"It would be absolutely appropriate, of course, if it is shaped like a colossal martini olive,\" he adds.

The Machine Age, Automobile Age, Space Age, and Information Age were among the most important trends. Each innovation inspired new urban visions, such as Howard\u2019s Garden City, Wright\u2019s Broadacre City, Archigram\u2019s Instant City, and Fuller\u2019s Domed Manhattan. Films like Blade Runner and Metropolis provided critical visions of culture and environment. Though none of these designs produced real roadmaps for the future, each contained interesting ideas. In the 21st century, architects and planners entered a new Environmental Era that introduced concepts like green design and planning, recycling and alternative energy to support sustainable development. This workshop explores new techniques of green architecture and planning through films, readings and lectures on cities worldwide. Using New York as a prototype, it also examines the evolution of urban transportation, land use, and social and environmental planning. Students develop several types of projects, such as the design of a green structure, the planning analysis of a park or neighborhood in maps and diagrams, and a photographic essay on an urban issue. No experience is necessary, but students will need drawing tools and a camera.
