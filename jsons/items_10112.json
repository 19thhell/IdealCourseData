In his period field, he is currently working on a book entitled, \"Things of Heaven and Earth: Figures of Philosophy in English Renaissance Writing.\" This study looks at the emergence of the philosopher as a distinct social type in the Renaissance, and at the complex interrelations between philosophy and theology on the one side, and philosophy and literature on the other.
