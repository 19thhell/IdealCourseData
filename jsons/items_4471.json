Our approach to understanding the diversity and evolution of past human behavior emphasizes ancient technologies and the importance of geological and environmental context for interpreting the archaeological record. The study of ancient technologies provides a solid foundation for interpreting the archaeological record and is a major research theme of the archaeology program in the Anthropology Department of New York University. We view artifacts as the basic unit of analysis for archaeologists. Artifacts are important in showing the evolution of technological complexity through time, and perhaps more importantly, provide the opportunity for rare insight into social processes associated with tool manufacture, use, and the ways in which developments in material culture are used as expressions of personal or group identity. The three faculty members provide students with theoretical, methodological, and hands-on training for each of the major technological facets of the archaeological record. They include the analysis of stone tools, artifact forms that dominate much of the 2.5 million years of the archaeological record; the production of symbolic artifacts that are crucial indicators of complex means of constructing identity through material goods (White), the production of pottery, a major transformation that facilitated increasing urbanization and large scale trade (Wright), and changes in food acquisition and processing (Crabtree) that mark fundamental differences in human interactions with the environment. The department maintains excellent laboratory facilities (experimental, ceramic, lithic and zooarchaeological) for teaching and hands-on research in prehistoric and protohistoric archaeology. These include an array of computer hardware and software, including image analysis and storage capabilities, fully equipped histological laboratory, in house optical and light microscopy, sample preparation, and zooarchaeological, ceramic and lithic technological comparative collections. The archaeologists in the department are committed to integrating students into long-term, ongoing field programs which they direct or in which they are key participants. At present, these include White\u2019s Paleolithic excavations at Abri Castanet, France, Crabtree\u2019s prospection and excavation at Dun Alinne, Ireland, and Wright\u2019s excavations and surveys at Harappa, Pakistan. These field and laboratory opportunities provide intensive training in excavation methods, data collection and analysis, geoarchaeology, total-station technology, remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Through collaboration with other departments and schools, students have access to technical support and courses through New York University, museums, educational institutions and CRM firms within the New York City metropolitan area. Working with small numbers of students (we typically accept two students a year), we are able to form strong collaborative ties and integrative programs among students and faculty. We consider mentoring and professionalization to be among our principal strengths.  SPECIAL RESOURCES AND FACILITIES IN ARCHAEOLOGY The department maintains excellent laboratory facilities for  teaching and research in protohistoric and prehistoric archaeology. An array of  computer hardware and software, including image analysis and storage  capabilities, is available for graduate research projects. In addition, there  is a state-of-the-art photographic laboratory, a thin-section laboratory for  seasonality studies, and excellent microscopic equipment, including access to  scanning electron microscopes. A zooarchaeological reference collection and  ceramics laboratory are available for teaching and research purposes.      Students  benefit from the close ties that exist between the department and other  programs and institutions. These include the Smithsonian Institution, the  American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of the American Indian, the  Museum of the City of New York, the New Jersey State Museum, the Center for  American Archaeology, and many museums, laboratories, and agencies in France,  Britain, Israel, Pakistan, and the former Soviet Union.

Here you will find an overview of the department\u2019s goals and programs.    One of the great benefits of majoring in Classics at NYU is the special attention students receive in a small department staffed by outstanding scholars. We cultivate a collegial atmosphere with monthly student/faculty teas, and we support the activities of a lively Classics Club. Undergraduates are encouraged to attend lectures by visiting scholars and in-house presentations of current research by faculty and graduate students. The Department's fifth floor space in Silver Center includes a library for students wishing to consult our specialized Classics holdings.    No special pre-college preparation is necessary to pursue a major in Classics.    The Director of Undergraduate Studies is Professor Michael Peachin . Please consult him for further information about programs of study in Classics.  Majors in Classics (five tracks)    1. Latin and Greek: This major requires two years of both Latin and Greek (i.e., four 4-point courses in each language) or the equivalent, plus either one advanced course in both, or two advanced courses in either.    2. Classical Civilization: This major requires ten 4-point courses. Either ancient Greek or Latin is required through the intermediate level (i.e., four 4-point courses or the equivalent). The remaining six courses may be selected from the various courses listed below. At least one history course and at least one literature course are required. Students are expected to discuss their program of study with a faculty adviser in the department, and all programs must be approved by the adviser.    3. Classics-Fine Arts (with emphasis on archaeology): This interdepartmental major requires two years of college-level ancient Greek or Latin or the equivalent, Introduction to Archaeology V27.0305, and four 4-point courses in fine arts (V43.0102, V43.0103, and two others selected from applicable courses, including those in Egyptian and Near Eastern art). This is a flexible major designed to accommodate special interests and requirements. Advanced-level courses in practical archaeology may be taken for credit.    4. Classical Civilization-Anthropology: This interdepartmental major may follow one of two tracks, each requiring 20 points from the Department of Anthropology and 20 points from the Department of Classics. The first track focuses on archaeology and requires A27.0303, V27.0305, and three other 4-point courses in classical civilization or languages. The second track emphasizes cultural anthropology and classical civilization, and requires A27.0303, V27.0143, and three other 4-point courses in classical civilization or languages. (Note: V27.0011 may not be used to fulfill these electives.) Additional requirements may be found under the Department of Anthropology (14).    5. Classical Civilization &amp; Hellenic Studies: This major offers the possibility of two different tracks. Both tracks require a total of ten 4-point courses.    Track A: Here, students concentrate in classical civilization. The major requires ancient Greek through the intermediate level (four 4-point courses), two 4-point courses from the offerings in classical civilization, and four 4-point courses offered through the Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies.    Track B: This track requires modern Greek through the intermediate level (four 4-point courses), two 4-point courses from the offerings of the Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies, and four 4-point courses from the offerings in classical civilization. (Note: A student already proficient through the first- or second-year level of modern Greek will take two or four courses in place of the first and/or second year of modern Greek, with the consent of the appropriate faculty).        Minors in Classics (two tracks)    1. Latin and Greek: This minor requires five 4-point courses selected from the offerings of the department. As part of this minor, students must take either Latin or ancient Greek to the full intermediate level (A27.0006 or A27.0010, respectively). At least two of the required courses in ancient Greek or Latin must be taken in residence at NYU.    2. Classical Civilization: This minor requires five 4-point courses selected from the offerings in Latin, Greek, or classical civilization.
