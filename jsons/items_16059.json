The show features book by Terrence McNally, music by Stephen Flaherty and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens. John Simpkins directs.     A Man of No Importance was developed from the 1994 film of the same name and tells the story of Alfie Byrne, a bus driver in 1964 Dublin who recites poetry to his passengers. He is also the director of the community theatre, which rehearses and performs in the neighborhood church social hall. Alfie\u2019s passengers are also his actors: amateurs who come to see the magic and power of theatre. Alfie\u2019s heart, however, holds secrets he can&#8217;t share with anyone but an imagined Oscar Wilde. When he attempts to put on a production of\u00a0 Salome in the social hall, he is forced to deal with bigotry and shame over a love &#8220;that dare not speak its name.&#8221; The musical originally premiered at Lincoln Center&#8217;s Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater in 2002, with a cast that featured Roger Rees as Alfie Byrne and included Faith Prince and Steven Pasquale.   NYU\u2019s production of\u00a0 A Man of No Importance runs February 5\u20137 at 8 p.m., February 7\u20138 at 3 p.m., and February 9 at 8 p.m. at the Frederick Loewe Theatre (35 West 4th Street). Tickets are $20 general admission and $5 for students and seniors. The performance on Monday, February 9, is a special \u201cIndustry\u201d performance, where attendees presenting a union card (AEA, SDC, USA, SAG) will be admitted free. The Industry performance will also include a pre-show audience discussion with special guests from the Broadway community.   A Man of No Importance features music direction by James Cunningham, choreography by Jennifer Werner, scenic design by Josh Smith, lighting design by Chris Dallos, costume design by Michelle Eden Humphrey, and sound design by Craig Kaufman. The production stage manager is E Sara Barnes and dialect coach is Evan Mueller. The cast features NYU Steinhardt students Steph Bacon, Ben Bartels, Ross Brown, Nick Case, Donald Coggin, Dan Corica, John Fitzpatrick, Dylan Landau, Alyssa LeClair, Delaney Parker, AnnMarie Powers, Maureen Regan, Matt Ross, Wayne Shuker, and Kaylee Verble.
