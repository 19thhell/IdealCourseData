Current News/Major Projects  Updated August 2013 Questions about the intertwined dynamics of cultural and linguistic change, and the various factors that motivate such change, e.g., developmental, generational, and/or sociohistorical, continue to guide my research projects and publications. I completed two comparative projects, which were done collaboratively with scholars who inhabit different continents and times zones. The research has been synergistic and dialogic, and has made me appreciate modern communication technologies more than ever.  The first project, carried out with linguistic anthropologist Alan Rumsey on Ku Waru (Australian National University) and linguist Lila San Roque on Duna (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics) focused on child language acquisition in three Papua New Guinea communities where different ergative languages are spoken. Ergative languages are ones in which the subject of an intransitive verb behaves like the object of a transitive verb, and differently from the agent of a transitive verb. (English follows a nominative-accusative pattern, that is, agents of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs behave the same, and differently from objects of transitive verbs). These differences raise interesting questions about notions of transitivity and agency, and their linguistic expressions. Drawing on our respective ethnographic and linguistic fieldwork data on children\u2019s everyday speech practices, we each analyzed how young children in these societies acquire and use the morphological, syntactic, and pragmatic resources of their respective languages to differentiate and mark key categories: agents, subjects and objects. This was followed by a three way cross-linguistic singular comparison to determine patterns of similarity and difference across these languages. Our findings contribute to broader conversations among linguists and psycholinguists interested in cross-linguistic patterns of language acquisition across typologically diverse languages, and what such patterns suggest about the intersection of language structure, sociality, and cognition. Our chapter, entitled \u201cThe acquisition of ergative marking in Kaluli, Ku Waru and Duna (Trans New Guinea), appears in The Acquisition of Ergativity, edited by Edith L. Bavin and Sabine Stoll, Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company. The second project developed during my visiting professorship in Social Anthropology at the National Museum, Rio de Janeiro (August 2010), during which time I had the opportunity to work collaboratively with cultural anthropologists Aparecida Vila\u00e7a (National Museum, Rio de Janeiro) and Joel Robbins (University of Cambridge). Our article, \u201cEvangelical conversion and the transformation of the self in Amazonia and Melanesia: Christianity and the revival of anthropological comparison,\u201d is anchored in our respective social and linguistic investigations of the introduction of Christianity and first generation Christians in Bosavi, Urapmin and among the Wari\u2019, and offers a comparative framework for studying processes of Christianization. It has been accepted in Comparative Studies in Society and History. As a consequence of the introduction of Christianity, Bosavi people also reformulated notions of place, a central construct in how they remember, as well as think and talk about themselves and others. I analyzed some these changes in a paper I presented at the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research conference on The Anthropology of Christianity (March 2013). With seventeen other participants, the intense and lively discussions of theoretical unity, diversity, and new research directions in this area were enhanced by excellent food, wine, and scenery in Sintra, Portugal. My paper, entitled \u201cChristianizing language and the dis-placement of culture in Bosavi, Papua New Guinea\u201d will be part of a special issue of Current Anthropology, edited by Joel Robbins, the conference organizer.  The Handbook of Language Socialization (Wiley-Blackwell 2011), edited with A. Duranti and E. Ochs, has just been published in a more affordable paperback. Introduced by an essay written by Ochs and myself, and followed by 28 original invited essays, it offers current research in this theoretically exciting area. It should be of interest to scholars in linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, pragmatics, applied linguistics and developmental psychology. For those wishing to read Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory in Spanish, it is now available: Ideolog\u00edas ling\u00fc\u00edsticas. Pr\u00e1ctica y teor\u00eda, ed. Bambi B. Schieffelin, Kathryn Woolard, and Paul Kroskrity. 2012 Madrid: Los libros de la Catarata/serie ensayos Unesco Etxea. Work on my book project under contract with University of California Press for the series, Anthropology of Christianity, continues. Based on ethnographic and sociolinguistic research in Papua New Guinea, the book analyses the impact of fundamentalist Christian missionization on the linguistic and cultural lives of Bosavi people. The New York Linguistic Anthropology Working Group, which is collaboratively organized and hosted at NYU, provides a lively forum for scholars to present work in progress. We look forward to lively meetings and post-meeting exchanges through the coming year. In addition, the Working Group in Urban Sociolinguistics, co-organized by linguistic anthropologists and sociolinguists, and sponsored by New York University, schedules workshops and seminars offered by leading scholars working on language use in urban settings.

Gorilla Journal 37: 12-14 Current News/Projects Updated September 2014 Since my last update we have said goodbye to two people, Will Allen (for a post-doc at Hull University) and Constance Dubuc (for a post-doc at Cambridge University). Both Will and Constance will be sorely missed! We have welcomed the following new members: Susie Lee (PhD student, started Sept. 2013), Megan Petersdorf (PhD student, started Sept. 2013), Lauren Petrullo (MA student, started Sept. 2013), Alex DeCasien (PhD student, started Sept. 2014), and Rachel Petersen (PhD student, started Sept. 2014). Our research interests in primate sexual selection, reproduction and communication have continued to develop, and several members of our group have undertaken visits to the field. In January 2014, I went with Sandra to the CERCOPAN sanctuary and to Gashaka, in Nigeria, while Susie visited Cayo Santiago. In the summer of 2014, Lauren went to Cayo Santiago, while Megan scoped several potential sites in Zambia for her dissertation research. The hormone lab is now fully operational, and several projects have utilized this facility in 2013 and 14, with a number of other hormone projects lined up for this in the near future. It was also used to teach a new Primate Behavioral Endocrinology class, with students from NYU, several CUNY colleges, Stony Brook University and Rutgers University. We have given a large number of conference presentations in 2014, including at the American Association of Physical Anthropology meetings in Calgary, the Animal Behavior Society conference in Princeton, the Evolution congress in North Carolina, the International Society for Behavioral Ecology Congress in NYC, and the International Primatological Society in Ha Noi. Constance and I organized a symposium on \u201cFemale mate choice in nonhuman and human primates\u201d at AAPA (co-sponsored by the Human Biology Association), and I was kept busy throughout the year in my role as Co-Chair of the organizing committee for the ISBE congress (which 1150 people attended). In the Fall of 2014 I am also giving seminars/colloquia at Columbia University, Penn State University, and in NYU\u2019s Dept. of Psychology. Following 2013, in which among other publications I guest edited two journal special issues (of Behavioral Ecology &amp; Sociobiology, on multimodal communication, with Eileen Hebets; and of American Journal of Primatology, on Primate Signals, with Stuart Semple), we have published another good number of papers in 2014. These include our first paper on guenon facial evolution, which was published in Nature Communications and covered in various news media, including Science, the BBC, The Times, Wired, Discover magazine, The Australian, and many others. We also have a new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, in which we show that rhesus macaque facial coloration is both heritable and related to fecundity in both males and females. We have recently launched our new website (www.nyuprimatology.com), complete with a new group name (Primate Reproductive Ecology and Evolution). We\u2019re also about to join twitter! (Tweets by Megan.) We have undertaken a range of other outreach activities, including live-blogging on the Ken Ham-Bill Nye creation vs evolution debate for The Huffington Post. A number of new and exciting projects are starting to develop, and I have agreed to guest edit a special issue of Hormones and Behavior on \u201cField endocrinology of nonhuman and human primates\u201d.

Current News/Major Projects  Updated August 2013 Questions about the intertwined dynamics of cultural and linguistic change, and the various factors that motivate such change, e.g., developmental, generational, and/or sociohistorical, continue to guide my research projects and publications. I completed two comparative projects, which were done collaboratively with scholars who inhabit different continents and times zones. The research has been synergistic and dialogic, and has made me appreciate modern communication technologies more than ever.  The first project, carried out with linguistic anthropologist Alan Rumsey on Ku Waru (Australian National University) and linguist Lila San Roque on Duna (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics) focused on child language acquisition in three Papua New Guinea communities where different ergative languages are spoken. Ergative languages are ones in which the subject of an intransitive verb behaves like the object of a transitive verb, and differently from the agent of a transitive verb. (English follows a nominative-accusative pattern, that is, agents of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs behave the same, and differently from objects of transitive verbs). These differences raise interesting questions about notions of transitivity and agency, and their linguistic expressions. Drawing on our respective ethnographic and linguistic fieldwork data on children\u2019s everyday speech practices, we each analyzed how young children in these societies acquire and use the morphological, syntactic, and pragmatic resources of their respective languages to differentiate and mark key categories: agents, subjects and objects. This was followed by a three way cross-linguistic singular comparison to determine patterns of similarity and difference across these languages. Our findings contribute to broader conversations among linguists and psycholinguists interested in cross-linguistic patterns of language acquisition across typologically diverse languages, and what such patterns suggest about the intersection of language structure, sociality, and cognition. Our chapter, entitled \u201cThe acquisition of ergative marking in Kaluli, Ku Waru and Duna (Trans New Guinea), appears in The Acquisition of Ergativity, edited by Edith L. Bavin and Sabine Stoll, Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company. The second project developed during my visiting professorship in Social Anthropology at the National Museum, Rio de Janeiro (August 2010), during which time I had the opportunity to work collaboratively with cultural anthropologists Aparecida Vila\u00e7a (National Museum, Rio de Janeiro) and Joel Robbins (University of Cambridge). Our article, \u201cEvangelical conversion and the transformation of the self in Amazonia and Melanesia: Christianity and the revival of anthropological comparison,\u201d is anchored in our respective social and linguistic investigations of the introduction of Christianity and first generation Christians in Bosavi, Urapmin and among the Wari\u2019, and offers a comparative framework for studying processes of Christianization. It has been accepted in Comparative Studies in Society and History. As a consequence of the introduction of Christianity, Bosavi people also reformulated notions of place, a central construct in how they remember, as well as think and talk about themselves and others. I analyzed some these changes in a paper I presented at the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research conference on The Anthropology of Christianity (March 2013). With seventeen other participants, the intense and lively discussions of theoretical unity, diversity, and new research directions in this area were enhanced by excellent food, wine, and scenery in Sintra, Portugal. My paper, entitled \u201cChristianizing language and the dis-placement of culture in Bosavi, Papua New Guinea\u201d will be part of a special issue of Current Anthropology, edited by Joel Robbins, the conference organizer.  The Handbook of Language Socialization (Wiley-Blackwell 2011), edited with A. Duranti and E. Ochs, has just been published in a more affordable paperback. Introduced by an essay written by Ochs and myself, and followed by 28 original invited essays, it offers current research in this theoretically exciting area. It should be of interest to scholars in linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, pragmatics, applied linguistics and developmental psychology. For those wishing to read Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory in Spanish, it is now available: Ideolog\u00edas ling\u00fc\u00edsticas. Pr\u00e1ctica y teor\u00eda, ed. Bambi B. Schieffelin, Kathryn Woolard, and Paul Kroskrity. 2012 Madrid: Los libros de la Catarata/serie ensayos Unesco Etxea. Work on my book project under contract with University of California Press for the series, Anthropology of Christianity, continues. Based on ethnographic and sociolinguistic research in Papua New Guinea, the book analyses the impact of fundamentalist Christian missionization on the linguistic and cultural lives of Bosavi people. The New York Linguistic Anthropology Working Group, which is collaboratively organized and hosted at NYU, provides a lively forum for scholars to present work in progress. We look forward to lively meetings and post-meeting exchanges through the coming year. In addition, the Working Group in Urban Sociolinguistics, co-organized by linguistic anthropologists and sociolinguists, and sponsored by New York University, schedules workshops and seminars offered by leading scholars working on language use in urban settings.

A GIS habitat map for the Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary, Cameroon. Gorilla Journal 37: 12-14 Current News/Projects Updated September 2014 Since my last update we have said goodbye to two people, Will Allen (for a post-doc at Hull University) and Constance Dubuc (for a post-doc at Cambridge University). Both Will and Constance will be sorely missed! We have welcomed the following new members: Susie Lee (PhD student, started Sept. 2013), Megan Petersdorf (PhD student, started Sept. 2013), Lauren Petrullo (MA student, started Sept. 2013), Alex DeCasien (PhD student, started Sept. 2014), and Rachel Petersen (PhD student, started Sept. 2014). Our research interests in primate sexual selection, reproduction and communication have continued to develop, and several members of our group have undertaken visits to the field. In January 2014, I went with Sandra to the CERCOPAN sanctuary and to Gashaka, in Nigeria, while Susie visited Cayo Santiago. In the summer of 2014, Lauren went to Cayo Santiago, while Megan scoped several potential sites in Zambia for her dissertation research. The hormone lab is now fully operational, and several projects have utilized this facility in 2013 and 14, with a number of other hormone projects lined up for this in the near future. It was also used to teach a new Primate Behavioral Endocrinology class, with students from NYU, several CUNY colleges, Stony Brook University and Rutgers University. We have given a large number of conference presentations in 2014, including at the American Association of Physical Anthropology meetings in Calgary, the Animal Behavior Society conference in Princeton, the Evolution congress in North Carolina, the International Society for Behavioral Ecology Congress in NYC, and the International Primatological Society in Ha Noi. Constance and I organized a symposium on \u201cFemale mate choice in nonhuman and human primates\u201d at AAPA (co-sponsored by the Human Biology Association), and I was kept busy throughout the year in my role as Co-Chair of the organizing committee for the ISBE congress (which 1150 people attended). In the Fall of 2014 I am also giving seminars/colloquia at Columbia University, Penn State University, and in NYU\u2019s Dept. of Psychology. Following 2013, in which among other publications I guest edited two journal special issues (of Behavioral Ecology &amp; Sociobiology, on multimodal communication, with Eileen Hebets; and of American Journal of Primatology, on Primate Signals, with Stuart Semple), we have published another good number of papers in 2014. These include our first paper on guenon facial evolution, which was published in Nature Communications and covered in various news media, including Science, the BBC, The Times, Wired, Discover magazine, The Australian, and many others. We also have a new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, in which we show that rhesus macaque facial coloration is both heritable and related to fecundity in both males and females. We have recently launched our new website (www.nyuprimatology.com), complete with a new group name (Primate Reproductive Ecology and Evolution). We\u2019re also about to join twitter! (Tweets by Megan.) We have undertaken a range of other outreach activities, including live-blogging on the Ken Ham-Bill Nye creation vs evolution debate for The Huffington Post. A number of new and exciting projects are starting to develop, and I have agreed to guest edit a special issue of Hormones and Behavior on \u201cField endocrinology of nonhuman and human primates\u201d.

Current News/Major Projects  Updated August 2013 Questions about the intertwined dynamics of cultural and linguistic change, and the various factors that motivate such change, e.g., developmental, generational, and/or sociohistorical, continue to guide my research projects and publications. I completed two comparative projects, which were done collaboratively with scholars who inhabit different continents and times zones. The research has been synergistic and dialogic, and has made me appreciate modern communication technologies more than ever.  The first project, carried out with linguistic anthropologist Alan Rumsey on Ku Waru (Australian National University) and linguist Lila San Roque on Duna (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics) focused on child language acquisition in three Papua New Guinea communities where different ergative languages are spoken. Ergative languages are ones in which the subject of an intransitive verb behaves like the object of a transitive verb, and differently from the agent of a transitive verb. (English follows a nominative-accusative pattern, that is, agents of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs behave the same, and differently from objects of transitive verbs). These differences raise interesting questions about notions of transitivity and agency, and their linguistic expressions. Drawing on our respective ethnographic and linguistic fieldwork data on children\u2019s everyday speech practices, we each analyzed how young children in these societies acquire and use the morphological, syntactic, and pragmatic resources of their respective languages to differentiate and mark key categories: agents, subjects and objects. This was followed by a three way cross-linguistic singular comparison to determine patterns of similarity and difference across these languages. Our findings contribute to broader conversations among linguists and psycholinguists interested in cross-linguistic patterns of language acquisition across typologically diverse languages, and what such patterns suggest about the intersection of language structure, sociality, and cognition. Our chapter, entitled \u201cThe acquisition of ergative marking in Kaluli, Ku Waru and Duna (Trans New Guinea), appears in The Acquisition of Ergativity, edited by Edith L. Bavin and Sabine Stoll, Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company. The second project developed during my visiting professorship in Social Anthropology at the National Museum, Rio de Janeiro (August 2010), during which time I had the opportunity to work collaboratively with cultural anthropologists Aparecida Vila\u00e7a (National Museum, Rio de Janeiro) and Joel Robbins (University of Cambridge). Our article, \u201cEvangelical conversion and the transformation of the self in Amazonia and Melanesia: Christianity and the revival of anthropological comparison,\u201d is anchored in our respective social and linguistic investigations of the introduction of Christianity and first generation Christians in Bosavi, Urapmin and among the Wari\u2019, and offers a comparative framework for studying processes of Christianization. It has been accepted in Comparative Studies in Society and History. As a consequence of the introduction of Christianity, Bosavi people also reformulated notions of place, a central construct in how they remember, as well as think and talk about themselves and others. I analyzed some these changes in a paper I presented at the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research conference on The Anthropology of Christianity (March 2013). With seventeen other participants, the intense and lively discussions of theoretical unity, diversity, and new research directions in this area were enhanced by excellent food, wine, and scenery in Sintra, Portugal. My paper, entitled \u201cChristianizing language and the dis-placement of culture in Bosavi, Papua New Guinea\u201d will be part of a special issue of Current Anthropology, edited by Joel Robbins, the conference organizer.  The Handbook of Language Socialization (Wiley-Blackwell 2011), edited with A. Duranti and E. Ochs, has just been published in a more affordable paperback. Introduced by an essay written by Ochs and myself, and followed by 28 original invited essays, it offers current research in this theoretically exciting area. It should be of interest to scholars in linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, pragmatics, applied linguistics and developmental psychology. For those wishing to read Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory in Spanish, it is now available: Ideolog\u00edas ling\u00fc\u00edsticas. Pr\u00e1ctica y teor\u00eda, ed. Bambi B. Schieffelin, Kathryn Woolard, and Paul Kroskrity. 2012 Madrid: Los libros de la Catarata/serie ensayos Unesco Etxea. Work on my book project under contract with University of California Press for the series, Anthropology of Christianity, continues. Based on ethnographic and sociolinguistic research in Papua New Guinea, the book analyses the impact of fundamentalist Christian missionization on the linguistic and cultural lives of Bosavi people. The New York Linguistic Anthropology Working Group, which is collaboratively organized and hosted at NYU, provides a lively forum for scholars to present work in progress. We look forward to lively meetings and post-meeting exchanges through the coming year. In addition, the Working Group in Urban Sociolinguistics, co-organized by linguistic anthropologists and sociolinguists, and sponsored by New York University, schedules workshops and seminars offered by leading scholars working on language use in urban settings.

Gorilla Journal 37: 12-14 Current News/Projects Updated September 2014 Since my last update we have said goodbye to two people, Will Allen (for a post-doc at Hull University) and Constance Dubuc (for a post-doc at Cambridge University). Both Will and Constance will be sorely missed! We have welcomed the following new members: Susie Lee (PhD student, started Sept. 2013), Megan Petersdorf (PhD student, started Sept. 2013), Lauren Petrullo (MA student, started Sept. 2013), Alex DeCasien (PhD student, started Sept. 2014), and Rachel Petersen (PhD student, started Sept. 2014). Our research interests in primate sexual selection, reproduction and communication have continued to develop, and several members of our group have undertaken visits to the field. In January 2014, I went with Sandra to the CERCOPAN sanctuary and to Gashaka, in Nigeria, while Susie visited Cayo Santiago. In the summer of 2014, Lauren went to Cayo Santiago, while Megan scoped several potential sites in Zambia for her dissertation research. The hormone lab is now fully operational, and several projects have utilized this facility in 2013 and 14, with a number of other hormone projects lined up for this in the near future. It was also used to teach a new Primate Behavioral Endocrinology class, with students from NYU, several CUNY colleges, Stony Brook University and Rutgers University. We have given a large number of conference presentations in 2014, including at the American Association of Physical Anthropology meetings in Calgary, the Animal Behavior Society conference in Princeton, the Evolution congress in North Carolina, the International Society for Behavioral Ecology Congress in NYC, and the International Primatological Society in Ha Noi. Constance and I organized a symposium on \u201cFemale mate choice in nonhuman and human primates\u201d at AAPA (co-sponsored by the Human Biology Association), and I was kept busy throughout the year in my role as Co-Chair of the organizing committee for the ISBE congress (which 1150 people attended). In the Fall of 2014 I am also giving seminars/colloquia at Columbia University, Penn State University, and in NYU\u2019s Dept. of Psychology. Following 2013, in which among other publications I guest edited two journal special issues (of Behavioral Ecology &amp; Sociobiology, on multimodal communication, with Eileen Hebets; and of American Journal of Primatology, on Primate Signals, with Stuart Semple), we have published another good number of papers in 2014. These include our first paper on guenon facial evolution, which was published in Nature Communications and covered in various news media, including Science, the BBC, The Times, Wired, Discover magazine, The Australian, and many others. We also have a new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, in which we show that rhesus macaque facial coloration is both heritable and related to fecundity in both males and females. We have recently launched our new website (www.nyuprimatology.com), complete with a new group name (Primate Reproductive Ecology and Evolution). We\u2019re also about to join twitter! (Tweets by Megan.) We have undertaken a range of other outreach activities, including live-blogging on the Ken Ham-Bill Nye creation vs evolution debate for The Huffington Post. A number of new and exciting projects are starting to develop, and I have agreed to guest edit a special issue of Hormones and Behavior on \u201cField endocrinology of nonhuman and human primates\u201d.

Current News/Projects  Updated June 2014     Pintupi dialogues: reconstructing memories of art, land and Community   through the visual record (Australian Research Council Linkage grant   2010-2013) .\u2028   I am currently completing work on an ARC Linkage grant to use visual   records to animate historical consciousness with the Pintupi   communities of Kintore, NT and Kiwirrkura, WA. This involves not only   returning to my earliest work in Pintupi communities, but also extending   my involvement with visual culture, representations, and art. The   grant is a collaboration with the mainly Pintupi Aboriginal-owned art   cooperative, Papunya Tula Artists Ltd., Dr. Peter Thorley of the   National Museum of Australia, and Professor Nicolas Peterson and Ms.   Philippa Deveson of the Australian National University, Dr Peter Thorley   of the National Museum of Australia, and myself of New York University.   Together with the members of these two remote Western Desert   communities, we are using film and photography to reflect on a pivotal   period in the history of the Pintupi people with whom I have been   working since 1973. In 1964, internationally renowned filmmaker, Ian   Dunlop accompanying then Patrol Officer Jeremy Long, had photographed Pintupi people as among the   last Aboriginal people still living a nomadic life in central   Australia's western desert. He returned in 1974 to film these same   people, now living at the government-supported Yayayi outstation where I   was carrying out my doctoral fieldwork.      (Fred Myers and Marlene Nampitjinpa Spencer discussing her memories of Yayayi) Using these visual records as the basis for a dialogue with the living   Pintupi descendants of those in the film and photographs, we are   reconstructing an account of how the Pintupi sought to fashion their own   modernity, with a particular emphasis on the great transition \u2013   sedentarization and incorporation into the Australian state -- in their   lives that took place in the 1960s and 1970s.     We have produced a film that attends to this dialogue, focusing on   Marlene Spencer Nampitjinpa's reflections on the film, entitled   \"Remembering Yayayi,\" Her reflections about herself and her family as   they appear in the footage incorporate points of view from several other   Pintupi consultants about the earlier film footage and the outstation.     As another distinct part of this, I am writing a book on the early   period of Pintupi living in this remote outstation community,   significant as one of the first outstation or homeland communities   established within the then-new policy framework of \u201cAboriginal   self-determination\u201d articulated by the Whitlam government upon its   election in 1973. The policies of \u201cself-determination\u201d \u2013 an expression   of international as well as local aspirations for colonized people --   have in recent years been heavily criticized by conservatives in   Australia as a failure and a significant cause of the many problems that   continue to plague Indigenous Australia. My goal in writing this book   is to confront these representations with an historically nuanced   account of life and the imaginings of a future in such a community.     Australian Cultural Fields: National and Transnational Dynamics  Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP140101970) \u2013 2014-2016     I am part of a new group project, funded by the Australian Research   Council and directed by Professor Tony Bennett of the University of   Western Sydney, that is just commencing. \"Australian Cultural Fields\"   examines the forces changing contemporary Australian culture. Focusing   on art, literature, media, sport, music and heritage, it assesses the   influence of transnationalism, digital media, migration and   multiculturalism, and the distinctive presence of Indigenous culture, on   the relations between culture, class, gender, ethnicity and nation.    The concept of \u2018cultural field\u2019 is taken from the work of sociologist   Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea to investigate how the   production and consumption of culture are affected by relations between   cultural institutions, policy agencies, and cultural markets. Australian   Cultural Fields will develop this perspective in number of ways. It   will be the first study to examine transnational forces, new information   technologies and the changing salience of migrant and Indigenous   cultures in the contemporary Australian context. Internationally, it   will be the first large-scale study to interrogate the relations between   the fields of cultural production and consumption.     It is going to be a challenge for me to work with new methodologies and   kinds of information, but very exciting. I will be working with some of   the leading scholars in Australian Cultural Studies -- Tony Bennett,   Graeme Turner, Greg Noble, David Rowe, David Carter, Deborah Stevenson,   Emma Waterton, and my old friend Tim Rowse.
