The project is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is the core research project of the New York University Health Promotion and Prevention Research Center (PRC). It is conducted in partnership with local health providers and community and faith-based organizations.   The purpose of Project RICE is to improve knowledge, increase preventive health behaviors, and increase access to health care services among Korean and South Asian Americans who are at risk for diabetes. In particular, this project aims:   To utilize community based participatory research (CBPR) methods to expand upon an existing campus-community partnership to develop and implement a CHW program among Korean and South Asian Americans that promotes diabetes prevention;   To gather descriptive information on access to care, health behaviors, and beliefs as related to diabetes prevention among these two populations in NYC; and   To develop, implement, and assess the efficacy of a CHW intervention to promote diabetes prevention and access to care among NYC Koreans and South Asians.   Asian Americans experience a disproportionate burden of diabetes compared to other racial and ethnic groups, and new and innovative ways to address health promotion and disease prevention are critical to reducing health disparities. Project RICE is the first intervention to test the efficacy of a CHW program to prevent diabetes in the Korean and South Asian populations. CHWs serve as frontline health workers who are indigenous to the community in which they work\u2014 ethnically, linguistically, socioeconomically, and experientially. CHWs\u2019 understanding of community norms, attitudes, values and strengths is valuable given the growth of minority and underserved populations whom health care providers have difficulty reaching.   Study Design   Project RICE consists of two phases. A descriptive study (completed in 2010) informed the design of the CHW pilot intervention (completed in 2012) and full intervention (launched Summer 2012).   1. Descriptive Study   Surveys, health screenings, and focus groups were conducted to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Diabetes resources and needs assessment surveys were administered in Korean and South Asian communities at community health fairs in order to characterize community members\u2019 general health needs, access to services, life style behaviors, and perceptions of disease as related to diabetes prevention and health promotion. Participants also took part in a health screening to measure fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, body mass index, and blood pressure, yielding clinical data on prevalence of diabetes risk factors among Korean and South Asian Americans in NYC.   Focus groups led by trained CHWs were conducted with Korean and South Asian immigrants (1 male and 1 female group per community). These provided particular insight into the health behavior practices of recently immigrated Korean and South Asian individuals that may have an impact on health promotion and diabetes prevention. Focus groups also informed our ability to adapt existing measures and educational curricula so that they are culturally relevant and appropriate for use in the Korean and South Asian American communities in NYC.   Brief reports on the results of the descriptive study in the Korean and South Asian communities can be found here.   2. CHW Intervention   This study uses a randomized controlled treatment design to test the effectiveness of a CHW intervention to promote diabetes prevention among individuals at risk for diabetes in the Korean and South Asian communities in NYC. Participants are recruited through outreach efforts by our community partners and CHWs in Queens and Manhattan. Eligible participants will be: (a) Korean or South Asian immigrants; (b) identified as at risk by a diabetes risk assessment; (c) between 18-75 years of age; and (d) willing to be randomized to either treatment or control groups.   Project RICE CHWs have undergone an extensive training and are based at community partner sites where they meet with eligible participants during 6 two-hour group sessions and follow up with weekly telephone calls. They provide social support, as well as informational/educational materials and instruction on diabetes prevention and health promotion. They also link and negotiate participants\u2019 access to a primary care physician. CHWs conduct baseline, 3-month, and 6-month semi-structured interviews with participants to assess predisposing and reinforcing risk factors for diabetes, diabetes knowledge and health behaviors, and primary client outcomes to determine the effectiveness of the CHW intervention.   We hypothesize that individuals in the case group, when compared to the control group, will experience:  H1: Greater reductions in weight, BMI, and hip-to-waist ratio measurements  H2: Improved access to and utilization of healthcare services  H3: Greater knowledge and improved changes in dietary and physical activity   Data will be analyzed to evaluate the CHW intervention\u2019s efficacy in health promotion and diabetes prevention in the Asian American community, as well as to inform the understanding of the contextual factors related to the intervention. If the CHW intervention is found to be efficacious, the RICE Coalition will make recommendations for the sustainable development of CHW interventions within community-based settings that serve other Asian American communities across NYC.

The CLP is focused on creating a sustainable web ecosystem and increasing digital literacy by connecting communities, businesses, entrepreneurs, and nonprofits with local student talent. Below, Ethan describes his experiences in the program, which is currently recruiting NYU students for its Harlem chapter.      For the past two years, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with the Google Community Leaders Program in New Orleans. When our team first came together in September 2012, we were briefed with the following statistic:   Ninety-seven percent of internet users look online for local products, services, or charitable opportunities, yet 64 percent of businesses in Louisiana do not have a website .   If the vast majority of people are searching for local products and services online, and a business doesn\u2019t have a web presence, they are virtually invisible in the eyes of the consumer.   So, 16 of us from four universities were split into four teams, and each team was assigned to a neighborhood in New Orleans. We were tasked with getting as many businesses online as we could leading up to Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013.   We started by canvassing our neighborhoods for businesses and working with the business owners to get them on Google Maps and using Google Tools. By February 2013, the CLP had empowered 160 businesses to get online!   As we\u2019ve continued our work, and as the program has expanded, I\u2019ve been able to combine my passion for music with the mission of the CLP. I now lead a team that teaches musicians how to expand their business by empowering them to use internet tools.   Through the work that my team has done with the CLP, the Mayor\u2019s Office of New Orleans approached me to organize a series of presentations and workshops for the musicians of New Orleans to better understand the business of music.   Additionally, while I\u2019ve been involved with the CLP, I\u2019ve co-organized the first two Startup Weekend events in New Orleans, the second of which was a featured as part of Google\u2019s Global Entrepreneurship Week!   The Community Leaders Program has been an amazing opportunity to get involved in the community. The program combines community engagement work with professional development, and gives individuals an opportunity to be a part of something greater than themselves.   Interested in being a Google Community Leader in Harlem during the 2014\u20132015 school year? Apply today! through the website or on CareerNet, Job ID: 924742 . Applications are due by Friday, April 4th, 2014. Please note that participants will be required to commit 10 hours per week to CLP-related work.

In particular, this project aims:   To utilize community based participatory research (CBPR) methods to expand upon an existing campus-community partnership to develop and implement a CHW program among Korean and South Asian Americans that promotes diabetes prevention;   To gather descriptive information on access to care, health behaviors, and beliefs as related to diabetes prevention among these two populations in NYC; and   To develop, implement, and assess the efficacy of a CHW intervention to promote diabetes prevention and access to care among NYC Koreans and South Asians.   Asian Americans experience a disproportionate burden of diabetes compared to other racial and ethnic groups, and new and innovative ways to address health promotion and disease prevention are critical to reducing health disparities. Project RICE is the first intervention to test the efficacy of a CHW program to prevent diabetes in the Korean and South Asian populations. CHWs serve as frontline health workers who are indigenous to the community in which they work\u2014 ethnically, linguistically, socioeconomically, and experientially. CHWs\u2019 understanding of community norms, attitudes, values and strengths is valuable given the growth of minority and underserved populations whom health care providers have difficulty reaching.   Study Design   Project RICE consists of two phases. A descriptive study (completed in 2010) informed the design of the CHW pilot intervention (completed in 2012) and full intervention (launched Summer 2012).   1. Descriptive Study   Surveys, health screenings, and focus groups were conducted to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Diabetes resources and needs assessment surveys were administered in Korean and South Asian communities at community health fairs in order to characterize community members\u2019 general health needs, access to services, life style behaviors, and perceptions of disease as related to diabetes prevention and health promotion. Participants also took part in a health screening to measure fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, body mass index, and blood pressure, yielding clinical data on prevalence of diabetes risk factors among Korean and South Asian Americans in NYC.   Focus groups led by trained CHWs were conducted with Korean and South Asian immigrants (1 male and 1 female group per community). These provided particular insight into the health behavior practices of recently immigrated Korean and South Asian individuals that may have an impact on health promotion and diabetes prevention. Focus groups also informed our ability to adapt existing measures and educational curricula so that they are culturally relevant and appropriate for use in the Korean and South Asian American communities in NYC.   Brief reports on the results of the descriptive study in the Korean and South Asian communities can be found here.   2. CHW Intervention   This study uses a randomized controlled treatment design to test the effectiveness of a CHW intervention to promote diabetes prevention among individuals at risk for diabetes in the Korean and South Asian communities in NYC. Participants are recruited through outreach efforts by our community partners and CHWs in Queens and Manhattan. Eligible participants will be: (a) Korean or South Asian immigrants; (b) identified as at risk by a diabetes risk assessment; (c) between 18-75 years of age; and (d) willing to be randomized to either treatment or control groups.   Project RICE CHWs have undergone an extensive training and are based at community partner sites where they meet with eligible participants during 6 two-hour group sessions and follow up with weekly telephone calls. They provide social support, as well as informational/educational materials and instruction on diabetes prevention and health promotion. They also link and negotiate participants\u2019 access to a primary care physician. CHWs conduct baseline, 3-month, and 6-month semi-structured interviews with participants to assess predisposing and reinforcing risk factors for diabetes, diabetes knowledge and health behaviors, and primary client outcomes to determine the effectiveness of the CHW intervention.   We hypothesize that individuals in the case group, when compared to the control group, will experience:  H1: Greater reductions in weight, BMI, and hip-to-waist ratio measurements  H2: Improved access to and utilization of healthcare services  H3: Greater knowledge and improved changes in dietary and physical activity   Data will be analyzed to evaluate the CHW intervention\u2019s efficacy in health promotion and diabetes prevention in the Asian American community, as well as to inform the understanding of the contextual factors related to the intervention. If the CHW intervention is found to be efficacious, the RICE Coalition will make recommendations for the sustainable development of CHW interventions within community-based settings that serve other Asian American communities across NYC.

The CLP is focused on creating a sustainable web ecosystem and increasing digital literacy by connecting communities, businesses, entrepreneurs, and nonprofits with local student talent. Below, Ethan describes his experiences in the program, which is currently recruiting NYU students for its Harlem chapter.      For the past two years, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with the Google Community Leaders Program in New Orleans. When our team first came together in September 2012, we were briefed with the following statistic:   Ninety-seven percent of internet users look online for local products, services, or charitable opportunities, yet 64 percent of businesses in Louisiana do not have a website .   If the vast majority of people are searching for local products and services online, and a business doesn\u2019t have a web presence, they are virtually invisible in the eyes of the consumer.   So, 16 of us from four universities were split into four teams, and each team was assigned to a neighborhood in New Orleans. We were tasked with getting as many businesses online as we could leading up to Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013.   We started by canvassing our neighborhoods for businesses and working with the business owners to get them on Google Maps and using Google Tools. By February 2013, the CLP had empowered 160 businesses to get online!   As we\u2019ve continued our work, and as the program has expanded, I\u2019ve been able to combine my passion for music with the mission of the CLP. I now lead a team that teaches musicians how to expand their business by empowering them to use internet tools.   Through the work that my team has done with the CLP, the Mayor\u2019s Office of New Orleans approached me to organize a series of presentations and workshops for the musicians of New Orleans to better understand the business of music.   Additionally, while I\u2019ve been involved with the CLP, I\u2019ve co-organized the first two Startup Weekend events in New Orleans, the second of which was a featured as part of Google\u2019s Global Entrepreneurship Week!   The Community Leaders Program has been an amazing opportunity to get involved in the community. The program combines community engagement work with professional development, and gives individuals an opportunity to be a part of something greater than themselves.   Interested in being a Google Community Leader in Harlem during the 2014\u20132015 school year? Apply today! through the website or on CareerNet, Job ID: 924742 . Applications are due by Friday, April 4th, 2014. Please note that participants will be required to commit 10 hours per week to CLP-related work.

Geared towards Executive Directors and Program Directors and Managers, CERT offers free workshops and webinars to strengthen the capacity of community-based organizations to participate in and develop community-focused research initiatives.   The overall goal of the CERT program is to increase racial and ethnic diversity in the field of research and community health by encouraging community-based organizations to engage in research as a means to eliminating health disparities and contributing to the national dialogue on community health.   There are three main objectives of the CERT program:   To increase awareness of CBOs\u2019 role in research to affect change at the community level   To build recognition of the importance of community-based knowledge and research in adding to the national dialogue on racial and ethnic health disparities   To increase the number of CBOs that engage in research initiatives   Please visit CERT Workshops and Webinars for past and upcoming trainings with supporting resources and media content.
