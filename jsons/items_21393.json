Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by the NYU school or college after a student is admitted. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will not evaluate courses for possible transfer credit before a student is admitted to NYU. Freshmen are generally awarded a maximum of 32 credits upon arrival at NYU and transfer students are generally awarded a maximum of 64 credits upon arrival at NYU. Transfer students must typically take a minimum of 64 credits at NYU to obtain a bachelor's degree from NYU.          AP Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for scores of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the College Board to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (NYU's code is 2562).     IB Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for grades of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) higher level examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the International Baccalaureate Organization to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.     College/University Course Credit   An official college transcript must be presented for evaluation and possible awarding of credits.   Credits Earned While In High School   Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better in the courses and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. Generally, these courses should be taken on a college/university campus, with other college/university students, and taught by a college/university faculty member.     NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.   Credits Earned After High School   Students may be eligible for transfer credit in courses taken for credit at an accredited college within the last ten years, provided the student earned a minimum grade of &quot;C.&quot; Upon receiving an offer of admission, students will receive a detailed evaluation of transfer credit. All courses specific to a student\u2019s intended major will be reviewed by the appropriate academic department. We are not able to evaluate coursework for transfer credit until an admissions decision is made.   Credit is not awarded for Pass/Fail grades and some schools and colleges at NYU have rigorous standards for credit. For example, some schools and colleges at NYU will only grant credit for courses taken on a college/university campus with other college/university students and taught by a college/university faculty member. The Stern School of Business will not award credit to freshmen for any economics, statistics, or business course taken anywhere but at Stern. In general, Stern freshmen should also not expect to receive any credits for math courses; in some cases, a student may be eligible to receive credit for calculus-level courses \u2013 but only after first completing a calculus course here at NYU.   Academic course credit will typically not be awarded for life experiences (e.g. work, internships, military service, etc.). Credit for courses taken online will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by each department/school/college after admission and upon arrival at NYU, provided that the course was completed at an accredited college or university.     For transfer students, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will provide a preliminary statement of transfer credit (accessible online) at the time of admission, to give admitted students a general sense of credit allocation a student can expect to receive upon enrollment at NYU. Preliminary transfer credit evaluations will not be provided prior to admission. Decisions on the awarding of actual credit will ultimately be made by each department/school/college at NYU.     NYU Abu Dhabi does not offer credit for any examinations or previous coursework. NYU Shanghai has yet to define its credit allocation policies.                                Country-Specific Examination Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing may be awarded for country-specific examinations according to the following standards:                                                          Commonwealth Caribbean Region                               Exam: CXC Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     Minimum Score: II     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      France                               Exam: Baccalaur\u00e9at   Minimum Score: 12     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Germany                               Exam: Abitur     Minimum Score: 10     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Italy                               Exam: Esame di Stato (Maturit\u00e1)     Minimum Score: 7     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 4 credits/points                                                                      United Kingdom                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points       Exam: Cambridge Pre-U     Minimum Score: M2     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Singapore                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Switzerland                               Exam: Matura     Minimum Score: 4.5     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                    NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
