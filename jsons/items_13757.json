We have developed a method of inducing cellular immune responses to metastatic melanoma that result in frequent durable complete regressions of disease. We also are interested in immunological and virological aspects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We are investigating HIV-specific cellular immune responses in acute, primary HIV infection and in elite controllers who \"spontaneously\" control HIV without antiretroviral drugs. We have discovered that individuals treated very early in their HIV infection develop strong CD4 T cell memory responses to HIV antigens, similar but often of smaller magnitude to the memory responses observed in elite controllers. Many individuals treated for one year after the onset of their infection are subsequently able to control their blood levels of HIV for at least 1 to 2 years after stopping their anti-HIV drugs.
