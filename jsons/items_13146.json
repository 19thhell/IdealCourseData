This will allow students to form room selection groups and/or select spaces without regard to legal sex. Please read the FAQs below to learn more about this option that is being offered in the Undergraduate Reapplication and Room Selection process .                                 Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            What does \"gender assignment preference\" mean?                                                       Indicating a &quot;gender neutral&quot; assignment preference allows for upperclass students to form room selection groups and/or select room spaces without regard to legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Why has NYU created the \"neutral\" gender assignment preference?                                                       The Inter-Residence Hall Council, with a student Gender Neutral Task Force, made a proposal last year for increased gender inclusion in the housing process for upperclass students. This proposal has been used to help define and implement a gender neutral housing option.                                                                                                                                                                          What is the difference between co-ed housing and gender neutral housing?                                                       The term co-ed operates on the assumption that there are two genders: male and female. It leaves little room for the progressive theories on gender, and no room for those who do not identify as their biological sex or those who are transgender. This idea of gender neutral housing is based on the notion that there are more than two genders, in fact an infinite amount. Allowing for gender neutral housing, as opposed to co-ed, shows more inclusiveness and room for diverse identities.                                                                                                                                                                          What other universities have gender neutral housing options?                                                       Over 100 universities offer Gender Neutral Housing options on their campuses. Here are just some of those universities:   Columbia University   Harvard University   Princeton University     Rutgers University   Stanford University   University of California                                                                                                                                                                          Who can indicate a gender neutral assignment preference?                                                       Any student that is eligible for the Undergraduate Housing Reapplication and Room Selection process will have the opportunity to select the gender neutral housing option. This option is not available to new freshmen living in FYRE communities.                                                                                                                                                                          Is this preference offered to first year students?                                                       The Gender Neutral housing option is only being offered as part of the returning undergraduate process at this time. Geographic diversity is a variable in the room assignment process for first year students in order to promote global citizenship and prepare students to take an active role in the Global Network University. Since this policy will directly impact a student\u2019s ability to request another incoming student as a roommate, the Gender Neutral option is not being offered to first year students. However, the Gender Identity assignment preference is still a part of the first year application and assignment process.                                                                                                                                                                          What is NYU's default assignment method if the gender neutral assignment preference is not selected/available?                                                       Room assignments are made by New York University on the basis of the legal sex of the student, which is the sex that appears on government issued IDs or legal documents.                                                                                                                                                                          I want my roommate to be of a different gender than myself. Will preferencing gender neutral guarantee this?                                                       Though students will be able to group and/or select rooms without regard to legal sex, we are unable to guarantee that you will room with someone of a different gender. If an individual indicates a gender neutral assignment preference without a specific roommate request, they will be able to select into suites that have been opened by other students who have selected gender neutral housing. In addition, if a gender neutral suite cannot be filled with students that have opted into the gender neutral option, the members of the suite will need to be re-assigned based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Will I be forced to live with in a mixed-gender room/apartment?                                                       No. Students will still have the option to group and select rooms based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Which halls will have gender neutral housing?                                                       Students will be able to select into any available hall via the regular Room Selection process.                                                                                                                                                                          Will indicating a gender neutral preference increase my chances of getting an apartment or building that I want?                                                       No. Students who select the Gender Neutral option will receive their selection times based on the same priority system as students who choose to group and/or select based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          What will the duration of a gender neutral housing assignment?                                                       Participants will commit to living in a gender neutral housing suite for one full academic year.                                                                                                                                                                        Can I change my gender assignment preference?                                                       During the Room Selection process, students can change their preference between &quot;neutral&quot; or their legal sex, however, this may affect the ability of group members to be assigned together. If their gender assignment preferences no longer match, they will not be able to select into the same suite.                                                                                                                                                                          What will happen to the remaining suitemates in the event that a vacancy occurs in a gender neutral apartment?                                                       If a vacancy occurs, the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services reserves the right to one of the following: place an \u201cunassigned\u201d gender neutral housing applicant into the suite, leave the vacancy open and combine two or more under-capacity suites, or convert the room to a single legal-sex room. This decision will be made at the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services\u2019 discretion but reasonable accommodations will be made wherever possible.                                                                                                                                                                          Is this only for students who are members of the LGBTQ community?                                                       No. Gender Neutral Housing is an option for any student who wishes to group and/or select a room without regard to legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Will you prevent people who are romantically involved from living together?                                                       Gender Neutral Housing is not intended for romantic couples, however, we respect and honor the privacy of our students. Current housing procedures do not require students to disclose the reason for their roommate requests. We encourage students to make mature decisions about their living arrangements, and make roommate choices that will help them experience a successful academic year.                                                                                                                                                                          What if parents don\u2019t want their student to live in a gender neutral room?                                                       We encourage students to maintain an open dialogue with their families so that they can be supportive of a student\u2019s housing decision.

This will allow students to form room selection groups and/or select spaces without regard to legal sex. Please read the FAQs below to learn more about this option that is being offered in the Undergraduate Reapplication and Room Selection process .                                 Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            What does \"gender assignment preference\" mean?                                                       Indicating a &quot;gender neutral&quot; assignment preference allows for upperclass students to form room selection groups and/or select room spaces without regard to legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Why has NYU created the \"neutral\" gender assignment preference?                                                       The Inter-Residence Hall Council, with a student Gender Neutral Task Force, made a proposal last year for increased gender inclusion in the housing process for upperclass students. This proposal has been used to help define and implement a gender neutral housing option.                                                                                                                                                                          What is the difference between co-ed housing and gender neutral housing?                                                       The term co-ed operates on the assumption that there are two genders: male and female. It leaves little room for the progressive theories on gender, and no room for those who do not identify as their biological sex or those who are transgender. This idea of gender neutral housing is based on the notion that there are more than two genders, in fact an infinite amount. Allowing for gender neutral housing, as opposed to co-ed, shows more inclusiveness and room for diverse identities.                                                                                                                                                                          What other universities have gender neutral housing options?                                                       Over 100 universities offer Gender Neutral Housing options on their campuses. Here are just some of those universities:   Columbia University   Harvard University   Princeton University     Rutgers University   Stanford University   University of California                                                                                                                                                                          Who can indicate a gender neutral assignment preference?                                                       Any student that is eligible for the Undergraduate Housing Reapplication and Room Selection process will have the opportunity to select the gender neutral housing option. This option is not available to new freshmen living in FYRE communities.                                                                                                                                                                          Is this preference offered to first year students?                                                       The Gender Neutral housing option is only being offered as part of the returning undergraduate process at this time. Geographic diversity is a variable in the room assignment process for first year students in order to promote global citizenship and prepare students to take an active role in the Global Network University. Since this policy will directly impact a student\u2019s ability to request another incoming student as a roommate, the Gender Neutral option is not being offered to first year students. However, the Gender Identity assignment preference is still a part of the first year application and assignment process.                                                                                                                                                                          What is NYU's default assignment method if the gender neutral assignment preference is not selected/available?                                                       Room assignments are made by New York University on the basis of the legal sex of the student, which is the sex that appears on government issued IDs or legal documents.                                                                                                                                                                          I want my roommate to be of a different gender than myself. Will preferencing gender neutral guarantee this?                                                       Though students will be able to group and/or select rooms without regard to legal sex, we are unable to guarantee that you will room with someone of a different gender. If an individual indicates a gender neutral assignment preference without a specific roommate request, they will be able to select into suites that have been opened by other students who have selected gender neutral housing. In addition, if a gender neutral suite cannot be filled with students that have opted into the gender neutral option, the members of the suite will need to be re-assigned based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Will I be forced to live with in a mixed-gender room/apartment?                                                       No. Students will still have the option to group and select rooms based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Which halls will have gender neutral housing?                                                       Students will be able to select into any available hall via the regular Room Selection process.                                                                                                                                                                          Will indicating a gender neutral preference increase my chances of getting an apartment or building that I want?                                                       No. Students who select the Gender Neutral option will receive their selection times based on the same priority system as students who choose to group and/or select based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          What will the duration of a gender neutral housing assignment?                                                       Participants will commit to living in a gender neutral housing suite for one full academic year.                                                                                                                                                                        Can I change my gender assignment preference?                                                       During the Room Selection process, students can change their preference between &quot;neutral&quot; or their legal sex, however, this may affect the ability of group members to be assigned together. If their gender assignment preferences no longer match, they will not be able to select into the same suite.                                                                                                                                                                          What will happen to the remaining suitemates in the event that a vacancy occurs in a gender neutral apartment?                                                       If a vacancy occurs, the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services reserves the right to one of the following: place an \u201cunassigned\u201d gender neutral housing applicant into the suite, leave the vacancy open and combine two or more under-capacity suites, or convert the room to a single legal-sex room. This decision will be made at the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services\u2019 discretion but reasonable accommodations will be made wherever possible.                                                                                                                                                                          Is this only for students who are members of the LGBTQ community?                                                       No. Gender Neutral Housing is an option for any student who wishes to group and/or select a room without regard to legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Will you prevent people who are romantically involved from living together?                                                       Gender Neutral Housing is not intended for romantic couples, however, we respect and honor the privacy of our students. Current housing procedures do not require students to disclose the reason for their roommate requests. We encourage students to make mature decisions about their living arrangements, and make roommate choices that will help them experience a successful academic year.                                                                                                                                                                          What if parents don\u2019t want their student to live in a gender neutral room?                                                       We encourage students to maintain an open dialogue with their families so that they can be supportive of a student\u2019s housing decision.

Most of what we    do, think and feel depends on our understanding of what it means to be    male or female, and on the different expectations people have for men and    women. Every aspect of the institutions, opportunities, and ideas    around us are permeated by gender differences. Our goal is to make    sense of this. Some of the questions we address are:             What do we mean by gender inequality? How does it arise?     Why does it take different forms? Why do some societies have    greater equality than others? How do the various institutions    like the family, the economy and religion affect the social position of    women and men? How do the direct relations between women and    men--as friends, brother and sister, lovers, spouses, parent and child,    colleagues, boss and employee--depend on or affect the social positions    of women and men? Why and when does sex inequality change?             On completing the course, students will know how to assess the major    social and intellectual questions raised by the issue of sex inequality.    Through intensive reading and discussion, this course will give    students the intellectual tools needed to understand and talk about sex    inequality knowledgeably and perceptively. This course also    promotes the growth of general skills in theoretical criticism and social    analysis.         Requirements:         All students must attend class consistently and punctually, join in    class discussion, write brief papers, prepare a \"gender social biography\"    term paper, take quizzes, and take a final exam.         All students should take part in class discussion and those who do an    outstanding job will receive extra credit.         Each student will write a \"gender social biography\" for a term paper.    This paper will try to show how your identity and experiences have    been shaped in conformity with gender expectations and how they have    defied or ignored them. The paper will take into account the various    kinds of social influences and experiences studied in this class.    During the semester, students will write brief gender biography    \"chapters\" for each section of the course, relating the subject of that    section to their gender biography. These will then be incorporated and    revised into the final term paper. Details about the gender social    biography are on another page .    No late papers will be accepted under any conditions.         A final examination will take place in class and cover all of the    course material. This examination will focus on the main ideas of    the materials we read and discuss in class.         Expectations:         A class is a collective learning enterprise. We must all act    responsibly and with decorum or the enterprise fails. We must each try to    avoid making the class less pleasant for others. This means we come    to class on time, pay attention, and avoid disruptive actions such as    talking to those in adjoining seats, eating noisily, and the like.     We will have a lot of discussion, some among all in class, some in    groups. Everyone is always free to disagree with other people's    ideas, but we should all treat everyone else and their ideas    respectfully. Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any kind will    not be tolerated.

Study Questions                   What do people commonly mean by the distinction between     \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex?\u201d          Why do people studying gender inequality stress a     distinction between \u201cgender inequality\u201d and \u201cgender     differences?\u201d          While making sense of gender inequality, why do we need to     keep in mind other forms of inequality within a society?          What is the difference between status inequality and     positional inequality?          Why do some authors suggest that the rise of women\u2019s status     over the past two centuries might be considered a paradox while     others suggest that the persistence of gender inequality in recent     decades might be viewed as a paradox?          In what ways has gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          What are principal ways that gender inequality persists in     the U.S. and similar \u201cmodern\u201d nations according to our sources?          What does Jackson mean when he says that \u201ctwo kinds of     social conflict fueled the decline of gender     inequality\u201d?          What do we mean when we say women and men are     unequal?          What do we mean by saying that women and men have competing     ideologies or myths about gender?          What is the difference between distributional differences     and categorical differences when we are comparing the characteristics     of two groups?          What is problematic about the common cultural explanations     of \u201cdeceptive distinctions\u201d between women and men?          How does \u201cframing\u201d work in Ridgeway\u2019s     analysis?                             II. How is gender inequality symbolized and reproduced in    everyday life?              Gendered Society : The Social    Construction of Gender Relations [111-120, 124-127]          Framed by Gender : Ch. 2 \"A Primary Frame for    Organizing Social Relations\" [important, read carefully]          Gendered Society Reader : Beards,    Breasts, and Bodies: Doing Sex in a Gendered World, Raine    Dozier          Gendered Society Reader : The Gender Similarities    Hypothesis, Janet Shibley Hyde          Gendered Society : \"So, That    Explains It\": Psychoanalytic and Developmental Perspectives on Gender    [86-101, 106-110]                       Study Questions                   Why is it meaningful to say that gender identities are both     voluntary and coerced?          How does gender inequality in modern society influence the power     most men feel they have?          What do people mean when they say institutions are gendered?          Why might some argue that Freud\u2019s theory attributed key gender     differences to biology while others argue that it did not?          How is it possible that gender identity (whether we are male or     female and what it means to be either) is learned (not inherent or     biological), but that we experience it as natural and     unchangeable?          What did Gilligan claim about the relationship between gender and     ethics, and why has the claim been controversial?          How would you explain the term \u201csex roles?\u201d          How does Dozier\u2019s study raise questions about standard ways of     distinguishing \u201csex\u201d from \u201cgender\u201d or claims that gender is socially     constructed by people \u201cdoing gender\u201d in interactions?          What is the \u201cgender similarities hypothesis\u201d and how do research     findings support or not support it?          According to Ridgeway, how are gender stereotypes related to a     general problem of coordinating social interactions? (And can     you identify any serious problems with Ridgeway's argument about this     proposed relationship? This part is very high difficulty.)          How, according to Ridgeway might the existence of framing lead to     social inequality?          According to Ridgeway what is the difference between specific     status beliefs and diffuse status beliefs?                             III.

How has the popularity of     biological explanations varied across historical periods and     cultures?          How is the work of evolutionary psychologists relevant to     the study of gender inequality, and what limits the value of its     contribution?          What seems to be the historical pattern of motives behind     brain research and hormonal research concerned with gender (and     sexuality) differences, and the results they find?          What was the influential argument that Margaret Mead     presented in 1935 book Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive     Societies?          Why are those who study gender inequality so concerned with     the division of labor?          When comparing across societies, what are some of the     conditions that seem to correlate with or indicate high levels of     gender inequality?          What do we know about the relationship between testosterone     levels and violent behavior?          According to Herdt, what is the significance of \u201ccoming     out\u201d rituals?          How does it make sense to think about the role of biology     in the origins of gender inequality?          How and why do we distinguish explaining the origins of     gender inequality from the persistence of gender     inequality?                             IV.

Study Questions                   Summarize important changes in women\u2019s economic     participation over the past 150 years. Among other things, it is     useful to consider differences by period, by type of women, and by     type of job.          How does the movement of women into traditionally male jobs     compare to the movement of men into traditionally female jobs?          How does employment potentially serve as a source of pride,     obligation, resources, negative identity for men and for women?      The goal here is to think through the reasons that women and men seek     and hold jobs and the effects that having (or not having) those jobs     have upon them.          What contributes to the wage/income differential between     women and men?          Explain the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d          How did goverment policies, laws, and actions influence     women's changing employment in the twentieth century?          According to Ridgeway, how have framing processes     influenced the jobs into which women are hired, women\u2019s promotions,     and women\u2019s wages/salaries?          Why is the analysis of \u201ctokenism\u201d important for     understanding changes in women\u2019s economic participation?          What seem to be the causes and the effects of sexual     harassment?          How can we explain how women\u2019s economic participation has     changed over the long term? Consider the motives and the     actions of women, ordinary men, and powerful men. Also consider     the difference between women\u2019s movement into low-status jobs and     their movement into high-status jobs.          According to Reskin, what causes women\u2019s wages or income to     be lower than that of men, and how does that argument relate to the     ideas present in other readings this week?          How have different kinds of discrimination influenced     women\u2019s experiences in the economy?                             IX. Political processes and individual action. How have    political processes, men, and women each both resisted and furthered    change?

Why do we want to distinguish between ordinary and powerful men while explaining the     persistence and decline of gender inequality?          Responding to changing circumstances, women and men sometimes      adopted new strategies or changed their typical behavior in ways      that contributed to gender inequality\u2019s decline over time.      However, even as they contributed to gender inequality's decline,      they typically did not seek to reduce gender inequality, commonly      did not favor a change in gender expectations, and often did not      even recognize that their actions could or would affect gender      inequality. So, how do we explain this pattern?          Why has men\u2019s defense of gender inequality declined over the past     150 years?          How have the goals of feminist movements been compatible      with (the effects and requirements of) long-term structural      changes in the U.S. and other modern societies? And in what      ways have their goals been in conflict with that long-term      trajectory          Assess the reasoning behind these two claims: \u201cmen have probably     sustained their gender advantages more through competition with other     men than through efforts to keep women from enjoying similar     opportunities or status\u201d; \u201cmen resisting women\u2019s advance      [typically] understood themselves to be fulfilling their      obligations or protecting well-earned rights\u201d.          How did both ordinary men\u2019s interests in opposing improvements in     women\u2019s status and their capacity to do so change over     time?           Writers have suggested that men long opposed women\u2019s movement     into high-status jobs (and women\u2019s access to higher education that     would prepare them for such jobs) because adding women would increase the     competition men would face for promotions and the like. Why is this a     strong or weak argument?          Why are culturally derived beliefs and rational calculations both     important for understanding changes over time in men\u2019s typical     actions that affected gender inequality? (Note that the same question     can be asked about women\u2019s typical actions.)          If most men in positions of organizational power share a     discriminatory attitude towards women, why do we expect any men with     similar organizational power who do not share these discriminatory     biases still to act (in their jobs) largely like their discriminatory     colleagues? (Note this question relates to the general problem of why     people conform, but in this question focuses on the causes specific     to the context of organizational power.)          What do analysts mean by the \u201cmale rebellion\u201d against marriage in     the second half of the twentieth century, and why might it have     occurred?           Why did men in government think differently about the woman     suffrage issue than ordinary male voters? How does this compare     to differences between the ways that employers\u2019 thought about hiring     women and the ways that male workers thought about it?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving economic     power through entrepreneurial success, rising through organizational     ranks, or inheriting wealth?          How do we explain women\u2019s difficulties at achieving political     power, both as individuals and collectively?          How have feminist efforts contributed to the reduction in gender     inequality, and how have those efforts fallen short?                             X. What role does ideology play in determining the relations    between men and women?

Cancian                       Study Questions                   What do we mean by institutional     individualism?           How does the impact on family organization made by the rise     of modern education compare to the impact of the rise of modern     industry?           What are the highlights of women\u2019s changing educational     opportunities in the U.S. over the past 150 years?          With respect to the U.S. experience, in what ways is it     likely that the education offered to women and men (at various     levels) influenced gender inequality over the past 150     years?          What were the major influences responsible for the rise of     meritocratic ideas and their increasing     influence?           Why does Ridgeway stress it is important not only that we     hold stereotypical beliefs about gender, but that we can take it for     granted that others hold them as well?          According to Ridgeway, what are the most basic, shared     beliefs about differences between women and men in our culture (we     are concerned with the content of the beliefs, not the     terminology)?          What, according to Ridgeway, decides which gender     stereotypes are embodied in popular beliefs about the differences     between women and men?          Why do people who privately hold \"alternative\" gender     beliefs seemingly still commonly act on the basis of the dominant     beliefs, particularly in their \u201cpublic\u201d     lives?           Why did the ideologies of female domesticity change over     time?          If men did not impose the content of the successive     ideologies of female domesticity, what     did?           What common characteristics of the otherwise diverse ideals     of female domesticity made them seem to work for both women and men     and for the acceptability of gender inequality to     both?          With respect to the determination of dominant ideologies,     what is the relevant common underlying idea in the Marxist concept of     \u201cdetermination within limits\u201d, the Weberian idea of \u201celective     affinity\u201d, and Merton\u2019s concept of \u201cfunctional     alternatives?\u201d          What does Cancian mean when she says, \u201cPart of the reason     that men seem so much less loving than women is that their behavior     is measured with a feminine ruler\u201d?

According to Ridgeway, what are the key conditions that are     obstructing, and could even reverse, the shifts toward gender     equality?          According to Ridgeway, why do gender stereotypes survive     disconfirming evidence?          How does Ridgeway use the idea of \"cultural lag?\"          According to Jackson, what are the principal causes of gender     inequality's decline?          According to Jackson, what are the main components of arguments     that the movement toward gender inequality is severely     threatened?          What, according to Jackson, are the principal defects in     arguments contending that our movement toward greater gender equality     may be stopped or even turned back?          How have interests affecting gender inequality changed over time     for important categories of men, women, and organizations? Are there     important relevant interests that have not changed much?          With respect to actions relevant to gender inequality, compare     how women's behaviors and life cycle patterns have changed with     analogous changes in men's lives."}]}]
