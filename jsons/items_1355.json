This course is designed to enable individuals to think critically about the ethical context and consequences of the decisions they will make in their respective organizational settings. By examining the interactions between the market place, societal norms and the law, students develop the ethical, analytical and reasoning tools necessary to identify and weigh often competing interests. Ideally, this enables individuals to make decisions which simultaneously cause no harm to the affected parties customers, co-workers, community, etc, furthers the goals of the organization and enhances the professional career of the decision maker.    The requisite ethical reasoning tools are developed by examining and analyzing a series of cases and related reading dealing with a variety of topics including: ethics of the individual business professional, product liability, the social responsibility of the corporation, moral standards across borders, ethical issues in financial markets, termination and downsizing, sexual harassment, and privacy.      Preparation for Class    This is a case course. Accordingly, the student's primary obligation is to  prepare for class discussions by thorough reading and analysis of assigned  materials. Case discussions and in-class activities are the principal means to  achieve the course's objectives. Adequate preparation involves four elements:       Study questions    Case Analysis Memorandums       Study Questions. The first two class sessions introduce the course and provide some basic ethical reasoning tools (ERTs). See attached list of ethical reasoning tools (ERTs) to be utilized in this course. Sessions #3 through #14 focus on major ethical issues in our society. Each subject (Module) contains cases, readings and study questions. By attempting to answer these questions prior to coming to class, students will be in a position to benefit from active learning exercises, which will take place during class time.    Memorandums. Written analyses of cases provide a deeper and more thoughtful means of developing the ethical reasoning and professional responsibility skills. Utilizing appropriate ethical reasoning tools, students should analyze a specific case. Multiple supporting ERTs should be used. Also, students should attempt to develop an optimum ethical solution.    Students are required to submit six memorandums during the semester. All students should prepare and submit a memorandum for Module #2 (class session #3), Gifts, Side Deals and Payoffs. There are two cases; choose one of them to analyze. This, as well as all other memorandums, should be two to three pages, typed and double spaced and is due at the beginning of the class when the topic is discussed. It will returned to you at the next class. This memorandum will not be graded, instead you will receive a checkmark (students who do not submit this memorandum will have points deducted from their memorandum grade average.)    The five additional memorandums required in this course, with the explanations of Module #8, Morals Across Borders and #10, Sales Ethics in Financial Markets, which are simulations, can be selected from any of the remaining Modules listed in the Topics and Assignments section of the syllabus. Your average memorandum grade constitutes 50% of your course grade.      In preparing your memorandum, please keep the following in mind:       All memorandums must be submitted by the class when the subject (Module)   is discussed. If for some reason you are unable to be present at the class   the memorandum can be left in my mailbox or under my office door in the   Economics Department Room 7-84 of the KMC, or faxed to my office (212)   995-4218. To avoid recurrent problems with Email attachments, no Email   submissions will be accepted.    Confine your analysis to one of the cases in the Module.    Only one memorandum (case) can be submitted per Module.    Memorandums should be typed, double spaced and two to three pages in   length. Abbreviations and acronyms may be used.         Final Exam. The balance of your grade (30%) is determined by your performance on the final examination. The exam consists of one or two cases which you have not seen. You are required to analyze them and to recommend appropriate action consistent with ethical reasoning and professional responsibility norms.      Simulations. To add a dynamic element to the course there will be two simulations during the semester. These involve the \"Oil Rig\" (Model #8, Moral Standards Across Borders) and \"Commission on Sales at Brock Mason\" (Module #10, Sales Ethics in Financial Markets) cases. Each simulation involves four students who volunteer to be principals in the case. The balance of the class serve as the decision making body. Students who choose to volunteer prepare oral testimony regarding the ethical issue at hand (two pro, two con). They are graded on the basis of their respective presentations. To encourage participation they receive credit for one written memorandum as well as class participation credit.    The balance of the class, which will constitute the decision making bodies (board of directors and arbitration panel), can earn class participation credit based on the questions they ask the respective witnesses as well as their comments and contributions to the deliberation process.    In addition to the information provided in the textbook (case texts and readings Modules #8 and #10), the instructor will provide supplementary material.      Classroom Discussion. Given the importance of classroom discussion it is important they be held in an effective and congenial manner. Please read and follow the attached guidelines.    Moreover, given the subject matter of the course it is natural that in the course of classroom discussions a variety of viewpoints will be expressed. This course is not designed to challenge students' respective views. Rather it seeks to instruct as to one's professional responsibilities. In this context, it is the instructor's function to direct the discussion to the norms currently prevailing in society. He must also assure that all students in the class have an equal opportunity to contribute to the discourse.

Latest edition.       Guidelines for Classroom  Discussion    About Listening. This course relies heavily on classroom discussion so  it is appropriate to give some thought to how we should go about it. The  following is a short list of suggestions which will make our discussions more  productive. Each class session lasts 170 minutes. During this time, you will  spend at most 10 minutes speaking. The rest of the time, about 160 minutes, you  will be listening. It is important, then, to listen well. It is recommended:       that you look at the person who is speaking    that you actively try to understand what he or she is saying    that you do not speak when someone else is speaking    that you do not raise your hand while someone else is speaking    that you always show patience and courtesy.       About Speaking. As noted it will not be possible for every student to  speak during each class period. Thus, when you do get an opportunity to speak  the time should be used productively. To this end the following is suggested:       that any time you speak you make one major point, not more    that you reference earlier comments, whenever appropriate    that you rely on cases and reading, not extraneous material    that you speak loudly and clearly to be heard throughout the room    that you express disagreements with courtesy and respect.

This course is designed to enable individuals to think critically about the ethical context and consequences of the decisions they will make in their respective organizational settings. By examining the interactions between the market place, societal norms and the law, students develop the ethical, analytical and reasoning tools necessary to identify and weigh often competing interests. Ideally, this enables individuals to make decisions which simultaneously cause no harm to the affected parties customers, co-workers, community, etc, furthers the goals of the organization and enhances the professional career of the decision maker.    The requisite ethical reasoning tools are developed by examining and analyzing a series of cases and related reading dealing with a variety of topics including: ethics of the individual business professional, product liability, the social responsibility of the corporation, moral standards across borders, ethical issues in financial markets, termination and downsizing, sexual harassment, and privacy.      Preparation for Class    This is a case course. Accordingly, the student's primary obligation is to  prepare for class discussions by thorough reading and analysis of assigned  materials. Case discussions and in-class activities are the principal means to  achieve the course's objectives. Adequate preparation involves four elements:       Study questions    Case Analysis Memorandums       Study Questions. The first two class sessions introduce the course and provide some basic ethical reasoning tools (ERTs). See attached list of ethical reasoning tools (ERTs) to be utilized in this course. Sessions #3 through #14 focus on major ethical issues in our society. Each subject (Module) contains cases, readings and study questions. By attempting to answer these questions prior to coming to class, students will be in a position to benefit from active learning exercises, which will take place during class time.    Memorandums. Written analyses of cases provide a deeper and more thoughtful means of developing the ethical reasoning and professional responsibility skills. Utilizing appropriate ethical reasoning tools, students should analyze a specific case. Multiple supporting ERTs should be used. Also, students should attempt to develop an optimum ethical solution.    Students are required to submit six memorandums during the semester. All students should prepare and submit a memorandum for Module #2 (class session #3), Gifts, Side Deals and Payoffs. There are two cases; choose one of them to analyze. This, as well as all other memorandums, should be two to three pages, typed and double spaced and is due at the beginning of the class when the topic is discussed. It will returned to you at the next class. This memorandum will not be graded, instead you will receive a checkmark (students who do not submit this memorandum will have points deducted from their memorandum grade average.)    The five additional memorandums required in this course, with the explanations of Module #8, Morals Across Borders and #10, Sales Ethics in Financial Markets, which are simulations, can be selected from any of the remaining Modules listed in the Topics and Assignments section of the syllabus. Your average memorandum grade constitutes 50% of your course grade.      In preparing your memorandum, please keep the following in mind:       All memorandums must be submitted by the class when the subject (Module)   is discussed. If for some reason you are unable to be present at the class   the memorandum can be left in my mailbox or under my office door in the   Economics Department Room 7-84 of the KMC, or faxed to my office (212)   995-4218. To avoid recurrent problems with Email attachments, no Email   submissions will be accepted.    Confine your analysis to one of the cases in the Module.    Only one memorandum (case) can be submitted per Module.    Memorandums should be typed, double spaced and two to three pages in   length. Abbreviations and acronyms may be used.         Final Exam. The balance of your grade (30%) is determined by your performance on the final examination. The exam consists of one or two cases which you have not seen. You are required to analyze them and to recommend appropriate action consistent with ethical reasoning and professional responsibility norms.      Simulations. To add a dynamic element to the course there will be two simulations during the semester. These involve the \"Oil Rig\" (Model #8, Moral Standards Across Borders) and \"Commission on Sales at Brock Mason\" (Module #10, Sales Ethics in Financial Markets) cases. Each simulation involves four students who volunteer to be principals in the case. The balance of the class serve as the decision making body. Students who choose to volunteer prepare oral testimony regarding the ethical issue at hand (two pro, two con). They are graded on the basis of their respective presentations. To encourage participation they receive credit for one written memorandum as well as class participation credit.    The balance of the class, which will constitute the decision making bodies (board of directors and arbitration panel), can earn class participation credit based on the questions they ask the respective witnesses as well as their comments and contributions to the deliberation process.    In addition to the information provided in the textbook (case texts and readings Modules #8 and #10), the instructor will provide supplementary material.      Classroom Discussion. Given the importance of classroom discussion it is important they be held in an effective and congenial manner. Please read and follow the attached guidelines.    Moreover, given the subject matter of the course it is natural that in the course of classroom discussions a variety of viewpoints will be expressed. This course is not designed to challenge students' respective views. Rather it seeks to instruct as to one's professional responsibilities. In this context, it is the instructor's function to direct the discussion to the norms currently prevailing in society. He must also assure that all students in the class have an equal opportunity to contribute to the discourse.

Latest edition.       Guidelines for Classroom  Discussion    About Listening. This course relies heavily on classroom discussion so  it is appropriate to give some thought to how we should go about it. The  following is a short list of suggestions which will make our discussions more  productive. Each class session lasts 170 minutes. During this time, you will  spend at most 10 minutes speaking. The rest of the time, about 160 minutes, you  will be listening. It is important, then, to listen well. It is recommended:       that you look at the person who is speaking    that you actively try to understand what he or she is saying    that you do not speak when someone else is speaking    that you do not raise your hand while someone else is speaking    that you always show patience and courtesy.       About Speaking. As noted it will not be possible for every student to  speak during each class period. Thus, when you do get an opportunity to speak  the time should be used productively. To this end the following is suggested:       that any time you speak you make one major point, not more    that you reference earlier comments, whenever appropriate    that you rely on cases and reading, not extraneous material    that you speak loudly and clearly to be heard throughout the room    that you express disagreements with courtesy and respect.

It is designed to enable  students to think critically about the broader context and consequences of the  decisions they will make as professionals and managers. To this end, the course  demonstrates that ethical considerations are important in the decision-making  process. The course then develops analytical reasoning skills that enable the  student to identify and weigh competing ethical concerns, and lastly, through  specific examples and case discussion, the student is made aware of the  importance of understanding the interdependence of markets, ethics, and law in a  free market society.    The course also introduces a broad range of &quot;non-market&quot; issues  encountered by managers and business professionals, and helps develop a set of  analytical perspectives for making judgments when such issues arise.    More directly, students exercise professional ethical judgment through  discussion and analysis. This requires the examination of cases, as indicated on  the course outline. The readings accompanying the cases provide the ethical  reasoning tools of analysis.    Preparation for Class    This is a case course. Accordingly, the student's primary obligation is to  prepare for class discussions by thorough reading and analysis of assigned  materials. Case discussions and in-class activities are the principal means to  achieve the course's objectives. Adequate preparation involves four elements:       Cases and accompanying readings    Supplementary materials    Study questions    Memorandums       Cases and Accompanying Readings. This is a seven week course. The  first week introduces the course, develops the concepts of ethical reasoning  tools (ERTs) , includes a number of readings which provide the fundamental  ethical reasoning tools and the opportunity to analyze a case. Students should  read all of the assigned articles which are found in the two appendices at the  end of the text in the course and in the Supplementary Materials for the first  week of the course.    In the six weeks that follow there are 12 modules each dealing with a  different ethical issue. Students should read all of the cases listed in each  module as well as the accompanying readings. Although the individual cases deal  with a specific situation, they all contain information which contributes to  finding an ethical solution.    Supplemental Materials. Prior to the week when an ethical issue is to  be discussed the instructor will provide Supplementary Materials to amplify the  information in the text. They are brief and should not be viewed as a substitute  for the assignments in the text.    Study Questions. Each ethics module contains a series of Study  Questions which serve to assist students in analyzing the cases and provide a  useful structure for classroom discussion. Students are responsible for mentally  preparing answers to these study questions before coming to class. The  instructor may ask some students to provide their answers to these questions as  a basis for discussing the case.    Memorandums. Students are required to submit four memorandums during  the course. All students are required to submit a memorandum for the Gifts, Side  Deals and Payoff Module or the Social Responsibility Modules which are assigned  for the second week of the course. To be assured that memorandums are written on  all four cases (two in each module) the instructor will assign them during the  first class. This will provide all students with an early opportunity to analyze  a case and receive feedback from the discussion of the cases in class and in the  form of written comments on your memorandum. Since some students are uncertain as to what is required on the first memorandum, you have the option of submitting a fifth memo to replace the grade on the first one. All memorandums must be  submitted prior to the discussion in class. Memorandums will be graded on a  zero to ten basis and will be returned at the next class.    The remaining three memorandums may be selected from any of the remaining  modules with the exception of the cases in the two classroom simulations - Moral  Standards Across Borders: &quot;The Oil Rig&quot; case, and Sales Ethics in  Financial Markets: &quot;Commission on Sales at Brock Mason&quot; brokerage  case.    In preparing your memorandum, please keep the following in mind:       All memorandums must be submitted by the class when the subject (Module)   is discussed. If for some reason you are unable to be present at the class   the memorandum can be left in my mailbox or under my office door in the   Economics Department Room 7-84 of the KMC, or faxed to my office (212)   995-4218. To avoid recurrent problems with Email attachments, no Email   submissions will be accepted.    Confine your analysis to one of the cases in the Module.    Only one memorandum (case) can be submitted per Module.    Memorandums should be typed, double spaced and two to three pages in   length. Abbreviations and acronyms may be used.    Study Questions should not as a rule be used to format your memorandums.       Simulations. To add a dynamic element to the course there will be two  simulations during the semester. These involve the &quot;Oil Rig&quot; (Model  #8, Moral Standards Across Borders) and &quot;Commission on Sales at Brock  Mason&quot; (Module #10, Sales Ethics in Financial Markets) cases. Each  simulation involves four students who volunteer to be principals in the case.  The balance of the class serve as the decision making body. Students who choose  to volunteer prepare oral testimony regarding the ethical issue at hand (two  pro, two con). They are graded on the basis of their respective presentations.  To encourage participation they receive credit for one written memorandum as  well as class participation credit.    The balance of the class, which will constitute the decision making bodies  (board of directors and arbitration panel), can earn class participation credit  based on the questions they ask the respective witnesses as well as their  comments and contributions to the deliberation process.    In addition to the information provided in the textbook (case texts and  readings Modules #8 and #10). The instructor will provide supplementary  material.    The &quot;Oil Rig&quot; simulation is scheduled for the fifth week of the  course and the &quot; Commission on Sales at Brock Mason  Brokerage&quot; on the sixth week of the course.    Classroom Discussion. Given the importance of classroom discussion it  is important they be held in an effective and congenial manner. Please read and  follow the attached guidelines.    Moreover, given the subject matter of the course it is natural that in the  course of classroom discussions a variety of viewpoints will be expressed. This  course is not designed to challenge students' respective views. Rather it seeks  to instruct as to one's professional responsibilities. In this context it is the  instructor's function to direct the discussion to the norms currently prevailing  in society. He must also assure that all students in the class have an equal  opportunity to contribute to the discourse.    Attendance. Ideally all students should attend every class. At the  same time it is recognized that work pressures, illness or family obligations  may prevent some students from doing so. It is better to attend part of a class  than to miss an entire class.    The instructor would appreciate it if you are going to be late for a class or  have to leave early for business or family reasons to let him know in advance.    Given that classroom discussions are a critically important part of this  course, students who are absent from classes will suffer in terms of the  learning process and in their grades.    Grading        Class Participation 20%     Memorandums 40%     Final Exam 40%       Grade Distribution. Professional Responsibility is a core course. The  Stern School suggested grade distribution for core courses is as follows:        A's 20% to 35%     B's 55% to 75%     C's 10% to 15%       It is recognized that particular sections may vary somewhat from the above  schedule.
