That in these traits NYU mirrors its home, New York City, is not a coincidence; from his earliest imaginings, Albert Gallatin \u2013 NYU's founder \u2013 foresaw a university that would be &quot;in and of the city.&quot;       For more than 180 years, NYU has been home to talented scholars, artists, writers and others who have been drawn from all over the world to teach, perform, create, and study. We have achieved international recognition in a wide range of areas \u2013 in the liberal arts, the sciences, education, the health professions, law, business, the arts, social work, and public service, to name but a few.     As you look around NYU, you will see an astonishing diversity of programs and people exploring new ideas, pursuing new knowledge, creating new art, and filling our classrooms with the vibrancy that comes from being an institution that is committed to research, discovery, creativity, and vigorous intellectual exchange.     Our connection to New York remains just as strong as it was at the time of our founding, and as the city has evolved into the capital of the world, so, too, has NYU become &quot;in and of the world.&quot; Today, NYU is the first truly global network university, tied into the world-wide flow of talent, with portal campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, academic sites for teaching and research throughout the world, and the largest number of students studying abroad of any U.S. college or university.

That in these traits NYU mirrors its home, New York City, is not a coincidence; from his earliest imaginings, Albert Gallatin \u2013 NYU's founder \u2013 foresaw a university that would be &quot;in and of the city.&quot;       For more than 180 years, NYU has been home to talented scholars, artists, writers and others who have been drawn from all over the world to teach, perform, create, and study. We have achieved international recognition in a wide range of areas \u2013 in the liberal arts, the sciences, education, the health professions, law, business, the arts, social work, and public service, to name but a few.     As you look around NYU, you will see an astonishing diversity of programs and people exploring new ideas, pursuing new knowledge, creating new art, and filling our classrooms with the vibrancy that comes from being an institution that is committed to research, discovery, creativity, and vigorous intellectual exchange.     Our connection to New York remains just as strong as it was at the time of our founding, and as the city has evolved into the capital of the world, so, too, has NYU become &quot;in and of the world.&quot; Today, NYU is the first truly global network university, tied into the world-wide flow of talent, with portal campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, academic sites for teaching and research throughout the world, and the largest number of students studying abroad of any U.S. college or university.

I hope that you enjoy your tour through our academic neighborhood. Arts &amp; Science is home to the College of Arts &amp; Science (CAS), the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS), Liberal Studies (LS), several international houses, and numerous centers and institutes. In Arts and Science, we take great pride in the high quality of our two fundamental missions: teaching and research. The teaching experience in Arts and Science is highly personalized for both faculty and students. The faculty use imaginative and innovative approaches that not only communicate critical information, but also make the subject matter come alive for the student. In addition to their teaching, our faculty are also engaged in exciting, ground-breaking research and scholarship. This not only contributes to the high profile of NYU among research universities globally, it also affords students the opportunity to engage in cutting edge research projects that capture their imagination and open new worlds for them to explore. A final exciting feature of Arts and Science is that we are part of NYU\u2019s Global Network University. This allows students in Arts and Science, as well as students in other Schools within NYU, to pursue a unique course of study around the globe (over forty percent of our undergraduates now study abroad). This distinct opportunity allows students to challenge their preconceived notions about different cultures and ideas, to push themselves outside their comfort zone, and to become genuine citizens of the world. As Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, I am privileged to enjoy collegial and lively interactions with our students and faculty on a daily basis. This is not only intellectually uplifting, it is also a great deal of fun. For those of you that are considering Arts &amp; Science at NYU, I do hope that you will make it your academic home.
