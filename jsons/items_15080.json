You fill notebooks with your plans for video game levels you\u2019d like to make. Or you spend entire weekends role-playing goofy adventures with your friends.   You run an online blog where you analyze the latest and greatest game releases. Or perhaps you just can\u2019t stop doodling your favorite video game characters.

If this is crazy, who wants to be sane?      What is the Game Center BFA?   The Game Design BFA is a 4-year Bachelors of Fine Arts program. We are located inside NYU\u2019s famous Tisch School of the Arts program, and like other Tisch programs in film, dance, and theater, we look at games as a creative form of art. Students in the BFA program learn about game design, game development, and game scholarship, preparing them for careers as game designers, developers, scholars, and critics.   The program structure first introduces you to the fundamentals of games through the lenses of design, technology, and culture. As you progress in the program, you have the flexibility to discover and pursue your own interests, taking courses that range from collaborative game production to critical analysis to specialized elements of visual and audio design. At the conclusion of your BFA study, you\u00a0complete a senior project, either as an individual or with a group.     A solid foundation. The required elements of the BFA curriculum covers the basics of making and understanding games on and off the computer. This includes courses like Games 101 , an in-depth look at the history of games from ancient board games to the latest videogames, taught by our entire faculty .       Broad and deep. The program emphasizes flexibility and choice. You can choose to focus in many areas, from game design to visual design, and from game programming to game scholarship. There are a wide array of classes from which you can mix and match your own education in games.       Senior project. All students complete a senior project \u2013 a one or two semester group or solo\u00a0endeavor. A capstone project might be making a game on or off the computer, or could be a research paper, curated exhibition , or take any number of other forms.       Integrated with the Game Center. The best thing about the Game Center BFA is that it is part of the larger NYU Game Center. Our faculty, staff, talks, workshops, resources, facilities, and events help make the program a world-class experience in the study of games.          Program Curriculum   The BFA in Game Design is a well-rounded, interdisciplinary degree that includes\u00a0 coursework \u00a0in game studies, game design and game development, as well as the option to specialize in game programming, visual or audio design, and the business of games. All of the courses in the Game Design BFA program are organized in seven areas. Each area represents one facet of the complex interdisciplinary endeavor of making and studying games.

All Game Design students must complete minimum of 44 credits in a combination of expository writing, humanities, and social or hard sciences.      Who should apply?   Some of our applicants come with experience in making their own games, but you don\u2019t have to be a life-long\u00a0gamer or a programmer in order to apply! The most important thing you need for the BFA program is a passion for games and the dedication to turn that passion into something real. It takes all kinds of people with a diversity of talents to make games, and we strive for a rich mix in terms of culture, gender, and background.   To apply to the BFA in Game Design, you will need to apply to New York University . You will also be sending in a portfolio for us to review. Your portfolio can be anything you want, as long as it shows off your creativity for games. It could be a film you made or a story you wrote. It could be the rules for a card game or a prototype computer game. Or perhaps an essay or blog post you wrote that helps us understand why you love games.   More information about the application process and the portfolio can be found here .      MAGNET   NYU&#8217;s Media and Games Network (MAGNET) is the home of the NYU Game Center, alongside programs from Steinhardt in Games for Learning , Polytechnic School of Engineering in Integrated Digital Media and Computer Engineering , Courant Institute of Mathematics , and the Center for Urban Science and Progress . \u00a0The stunning brand new space includes state of the art classrooms and studios, a black box theater, recording studio, 3D and large format printers, and the Game Center Open Library , all of which is available to Game Design BFA students. \u00a0The integration of many different departments in one place leads\u00a0to new collaborations across disciplines and schools at NYU.

Andy Nealen    Assistant Professor in Game Engineering, Computer Graphics, Perceptual Science   nealen@nyu.edu                Andy is a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, where he teaches and researches computer graphics, game design, and game engineering. Some time ago he studied Architecture and Structural Engineering, and worked in those fields before turning his attention to the study and design of games and computer graphics. He obtained his PhD in computer science at TU Berlin, helped out with the Apple-Design-Award-winning game Osmos, published work at SIGGRAPH, and has spoken at international game and computer graphics conferences. Some of his current obsessions include minimalist game design, tabletop game design, interactive shape modeling and animation, the semiology of graphics, perceptual science, and minimal graphical user interfaces. When not thinking about design, research, and/or traveling, he indulges in sessions of StarCraft, Street Fighter, Chess, Go, and too many other video and tabletop games.

I research and develop methods for making games more fun, easier to design and develop, more adaptive, or just to enable games and interactive experiences that we cannot yet create. I&#39;m interested in all kinds of games that people actually play: video games, board games, card games or mind games. When it comes to AI techniques I&#39;m flexible and willing to engage with all kinds of methods, but my methodological roots are in evolutionary computation and neural networks. Some keywords that describe what I do are game AI, player modelling, procedural content generation, automatic game design, believable bot behaviour, coevolution, neuroevolution, genetic programming and monte carlo tree search.

Aaron is graduate of UC Berkeley and MIT, where he worked in the Computer Graphics Group under Leonard McMillan and Steven Gortler on light field image-based rendering. Aaron is also a founding partner of Indie Fund (www.indie-fund.com), which aims to support the growth of games as a medium by helping indie developers get and stay financially independent, funding hits like Monaco, Dear Esther, Antichamber, and more. He has co-created with his partnership AppAbove Games (www.appabovegames.com) more than 10 indie mobile games and most recently Chip Chain for iOS and Android. Aaron is an organizer for IndieCade East, has spoken at many conferences including Game Developer Conference and SIGGRAPH, and helps advise game related startups such as IndieBox, Cartrdge, and the NYU Game Center Incubator.

Ramsey Nasser   Developer in Residence                   Ramsey Nasser is a computer scientist, game designer, and educator based in Brooklyn. He researches programming languages by building tools to make computation more expressive and implementing projects that question the basic assumptions we make about code itself. His games playfully push people out of their comfort zones, and are often written in experimental programming languages of his design. A former Eyebeam fellow and a member of Kitchen Table Coders, when he is not reasoning about abstract unintuitive machines, he builds and maintains vintage motorcycles.
