Students in 8th grade passing the Checkpoint A exam will be awarded one year of high school credit. Students who pass Checkpoint B exam in high school will not only earn high school foreign language credits but also meet the language requirement to earn a more prestigious &quot;Regents Diploma.&quot; Checkpoint B Exam Currently, New York State does not offer these exams for the Chinese language. It does, however, gives school districts the choice of making up a local exam equivalent to the LOTE exams, provided that the exam follows the same guidelines as the existing state LOTE exams. NYC follows this policy and writes its own LOTE &quot;Regents-like&quot; (Checkpoint B) exam in various languages. including Chinese. High schools in NYC should pay attention to the DOE assessment news regarding when and how to order the Checkpoint B &quot;Comprehensive Examination&quot; in Chinese. Checkpoint A - the Secondary Language Proficiency (SLP) Exam: Collaboration among Districts New York State does not offer this exam in Chinese either. Many districts outside of NYC that offer Chinese language programs are concerned with this middle school test. A process has been set up recently to facilitate collaboration among districts with this need. Each district will contribute several test items which follow state guidelines and will in turn be eligible to receive test items from other participating districts. The goal is to have test items for all sections of the test ready in April so districts can put together their own SLP test.
