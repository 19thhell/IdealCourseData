Those who aspire to be entrepreneurial leaders of industry or the private bar, or advisers to governments, international organizations or NGOs, study with some of the world\u2019s leading experts on the multi-jurisdictional and global regulation of trade in goods, services, and capital flows. Through intensive coursework, students develop an intellectual toolbox for future careers in an age of economic globalization.    This full-time program trains students to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of existing forms of public and private regulation, and to utilize litigation and arbitration as enforcement tools or as strategies to produce changes in the law. Unlike a course of study in corporate law, focus is given not only to shaping contracts and transactions, but also to solving disputes that arise in a transnational setting. Outstanding international law and business law professors are joined by faculty who teach securities regulation, banking and financial services, transnational litigation, international and foreign investment arbitration, comparative and international antitrust regulation, international bankruptcy, trade law, civil procedure, and other business-related fields. Professors\u2019 expertise in these areas is integrated with the diverse social and economic issues that policy makers and others consider.   The Curriculum and Master\u2019s Thesis   The curriculum is built around a year-long required seminar, entitled International Business Transactions , and a set of core classes which focus on business law as well as transnational litigation and international arbitration. All students complete a master\u2019s thesis as part of the required seminar, enabling them to cap their year working closely with faculty on an intensive, research-driven project.   Other than the required seminar, thesis and core classes, students may select from the list of related elective courses to further develop their expertise. The degree program provides considerable scope for specialization, but also ensures that students see a wider context so they are prepared to craft innovative solutions and think imaginatively about issues and challenges arising in an international business context. The Law School\u2019s library and various centers, such as the Center for Transnational Litigation, Arbitration and Commercial Law , provide abundant resources for accomplishing advanced inquiries. Students will also benefit from the presence of scholars-in-residence at the Center for Transational Litigation and Commercial Law, each scholar will spend one month at NYU School of Law to conduct independent research in the specific areas on which the Center is focusing   Focus on Courses   The Law School and the NYU Stern School of Business have a long history of collaboration. This relationship includes cross-listed courses open to both student populations, opportunities to participate in the activities of the Pollack Center for Law and Business , and invitations to business faculty to teach or co-teach classes in the Law School. Also, master\u2019s students in this program may take some business school classes of a related nature for credit toward their degree, with appropriate permission.   Many Law School classes in public and private law focus on the transactions, contracts and deals that shape a lawyer\u2019s practice in a global context. Some of the courses that will follow this approach are:     A Study of Cross Border Insolvency: Cases and Relevant Law   Advanced International Law   Commercial Sales Law: Domestic and International   Conflict of Laws   International Business Transactions   International Commercial Arbitration   International Investment Law &amp; Arbitration   International Tax Policy Seminar   Introduction to US Civil Procedure   Law and Policy of Foreign Investment Seminar   Oral Advocacy in International Investment and Commercial Arbitration Seminar                                  Find out more           International Business Regulation, Litigation and Arbitration:     Faculty   Degree Requirements                   Intellectual Life             Center for Transnational Litigation, Arbitration, and Commercial Law   Pollack Center for Law &amp; Business   Institute for International Law and Justice   Investment Law Forum   Hauser Global Law School Program   Center for Financial Institutions   Journal of Law &amp; Business   Journal of International Law &amp; Politics   Law and Economics Colloquium   Program on Corporate Compliance and Enforcement                   Careers           The Office of Career Services assists students with their job search process, offering services and training to prepare them for entry into positions in the private law market. A key part of this process is the annual International Student Interview Program , designed to bring students together with employers from around the globe.   The IBRLA LLM program together with the Center for Transnational Litigation, Arbitration and Commercial Law also offers opportunities for LLM students to meet informally with practitioners in their field of interest. One such opportunity is the Arbitration Forum, which is aimed at bringing together students, academics and practitioners to discuss current topics. Students will also meet and interact with practitioners during the mandatory International Business Transactions seminar, where practitioners are invited to act as commentators on the occasion of student presentations.   The International Finance and Development Fellowship Program provides a select number of LLM graduates with funding from the Law School to pursue a short-term fellowship at an international organization, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.   For those with an interest in law teaching, the Academic Careers Program provides a comprehensive curriculum that educates students and assists them with entry into academia.

Those who aspire to be entrepreneurial leaders of industry or the private bar, or advisers to governments, international organizations or NGOs, study with some of the world\u2019s leading experts on the multi-jurisdictional and global regulation of trade in goods, services, and capital flows. Through intensive coursework, students develop an intellectual toolbox for future careers in an age of economic globalization.    This full-time program trains students to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of existing forms of public and private regulation, and to utilize litigation and arbitration as enforcement tools or as strategies to produce changes in the law. Unlike a course of study in corporate law, focus is given not only to shaping contracts and transactions, but also to solving disputes that arise in a transnational setting. Outstanding international law and business law professors are joined by faculty who teach securities regulation, banking and financial services, transnational litigation, international and foreign investment arbitration, comparative and international antitrust regulation, international bankruptcy, trade law, civil procedure, and other business-related fields. Professors\u2019 expertise in these areas is integrated with the diverse social and economic issues that policy makers and others consider.   The Curriculum and Master\u2019s Thesis   The curriculum is built around a year-long required seminar, entitled International Business Transactions , and a set of core classes which focus on business law as well as transnational litigation and international arbitration. All students complete a master\u2019s thesis as part of the required seminar, enabling them to cap their year working closely with faculty on an intensive, research-driven project.   Other than the required seminar, thesis and core classes, students may select from the list of related elective courses to further develop their expertise. The degree program provides considerable scope for specialization, but also ensures that students see a wider context so they are prepared to craft innovative solutions and think imaginatively about issues and challenges arising in an international business context. The Law School\u2019s library and various centers, such as the Center for Transnational Litigation, Arbitration and Commercial Law , provide abundant resources for accomplishing advanced inquiries. Students will also benefit from the presence of scholars-in-residence at the Center for Transational Litigation and Commercial Law, each scholar will spend one month at NYU School of Law to conduct independent research in the specific areas on which the Center is focusing   Focus on Courses   The Law School and the NYU Stern School of Business have a long history of collaboration. This relationship includes cross-listed courses open to both student populations, opportunities to participate in the activities of the Pollack Center for Law and Business , and invitations to business faculty to teach or co-teach classes in the Law School. Also, master\u2019s students in this program may take some business school classes of a related nature for credit toward their degree, with appropriate permission.   Many Law School classes in public and private law focus on the transactions, contracts and deals that shape a lawyer\u2019s practice in a global context. Some of the courses that will follow this approach are:     A Study of Cross Border Insolvency: Cases and Relevant Law   Advanced International Law   Commercial Sales Law: Domestic and International   Conflict of Laws   International Business Transactions   International Commercial Arbitration   International Investment Law &amp; Arbitration   International Tax Policy Seminar   Introduction to US Civil Procedure   Law and Policy of Foreign Investment Seminar   Oral Advocacy in International Investment and Commercial Arbitration Seminar                                  Find out more           International Business Regulation, Litigation and Arbitration:     Faculty   Degree Requirements                   Intellectual Life             Center for Transnational Litigation, Arbitration, and Commercial Law   Pollack Center for Law &amp; Business   Institute for International Law and Justice   Investment Law Forum   Hauser Global Law School Program   Center for Financial Institutions   Journal of Law &amp; Business   Journal of International Law &amp; Politics   Law and Economics Colloquium   Program on Corporate Compliance and Enforcement                   Careers           The Office of Career Services assists students with their job search process, offering services and training to prepare them for entry into positions in the private law market. A key part of this process is the annual International Student Interview Program , designed to bring students together with employers from around the globe.   The IBRLA LLM program together with the Center for Transnational Litigation, Arbitration and Commercial Law also offers opportunities for LLM students to meet informally with practitioners in their field of interest. One such opportunity is the Arbitration Forum, which is aimed at bringing together students, academics and practitioners to discuss current topics. Students will also meet and interact with practitioners during the mandatory International Business Transactions seminar, where practitioners are invited to act as commentators on the occasion of student presentations.   The International Finance and Development Fellowship Program provides a select number of LLM graduates with funding from the Law School to pursue a short-term fellowship at an international organization, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
