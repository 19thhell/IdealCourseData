The NYU Paris academic center is located within proximity of Paris' most renowned cultural, artistic, and academic institutions. The resident director, administrative staff, and faculty advise students during their stay in Paris. During the summer session, all undergraduates are housed in student residences in lively and historic neighborhoods. Experience the City of Light with its cultural richness, history, and vibrant daily life through this intellectually and aesthetically stimulating study abroad program.          ACADEMICS   The undergraduate program in Paris provides a rich introduction to historic and present-day France through classroom studies and diverse extracurricular activities. Intensive French language classes, offered at all levels, are taught by instructors with native proficiency. Faculty who teach French civilization courses (offered in English or in French), provide exceptional academic instruction. Courses include field trips to culturally significant sites in the city.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students must stay in NYU provided housing. Participants in the summer undergraduate program are housed in a residence hall in a lively neighborhood close to the historic neighborhoods of the Marais and the Bastille, and within easy commuting distance to the NYU academic center.   All classes are held at the centrally located NYU Paris Center, comprised of classrooms, a student lounge, a lecture hall, and computer terminals for student use. Students are also strongly recommended to bring their own laptop computers. The NYU Paris staff helps students make the most of their summer in Paris. Full-time staff includes the Resident Director of NYU Paris, Academic and Student Life Staff, and an on-site Counselor.           EXCURSIONS      To enhance students' academic experience, NYU Paris hosts several lectures throughout the summer session that bring together French and Francophone artists, scholars, and activists. Cultural activities such as neighborhood walking tours, visits to world famous museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, and attendance at numerous ballet, concert, and theatre performances are scheduled to complement the academic program. Excursions further complete the cultural calendar: activities planned for 2015 may include day trips to Chartres, Giverny, and the D-Day beaches in Normandy.

The NYU Paris academic center is located within proximity of Paris' most renowned cultural, artistic, and academic institutions. The resident director, administrative staff, and faculty advise students during their stay in Paris. During the summer session, all undergraduates are housed in student residences in lively and historic neighborhoods. Experience the City of Light with its cultural richness, history, and vibrant daily life through this intellectually and aesthetically stimulating study abroad program.          ACADEMICS   The undergraduate program in Paris provides a rich introduction to historic and present-day France through classroom studies and diverse extracurricular activities. Intensive French language classes, offered at all levels, are taught by instructors with native proficiency. Faculty who teach French civilization courses (offered in English or in French), provide exceptional academic instruction. Courses include field trips to culturally significant sites in the city.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students must stay in NYU provided housing. Participants in the summer undergraduate program are housed in a residence hall in a lively neighborhood close to the historic neighborhoods of the Marais and the Bastille, and within easy commuting distance to the NYU academic center.   All classes are held at the centrally located NYU Paris Center, comprised of classrooms, a student lounge, a lecture hall, and computer terminals for student use. Students are also strongly recommended to bring their own laptop computers. The NYU Paris staff helps students make the most of their summer in Paris. Full-time staff includes the Resident Director of NYU Paris, Academic and Student Life Staff, and an on-site Counselor.           EXCURSIONS      To enhance students' academic experience, NYU Paris hosts several lectures throughout the summer session that bring together French and Francophone artists, scholars, and activists. Cultural activities such as neighborhood walking tours, visits to world famous museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, and attendance at numerous ballet, concert, and theatre performances are scheduled to complement the academic program. Excursions further complete the cultural calendar: activities planned for 2015 may include day trips to Chartres, Giverny, and the D-Day beaches in Normandy.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula.

While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Sample Syllabus coming soon                                                                          The Politics of Climate Change - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               This course examines the interaction between two coupled systems, the Earth system and humanity\u2019s political systems. Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Modern Spanish Poetry in Context - SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               Course description coming soon.                                                                    Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

The NYU Paris academic center is located within proximity of Paris' most renowned cultural, artistic, and academic institutions. The resident director, administrative staff, and faculty advise students during their stay in Paris. During the summer session, all undergraduates are housed in student residences in lively and historic neighborhoods. Experience the City of Light with its cultural richness, history, and vibrant daily life through this intellectually and aesthetically stimulating study abroad program.          ACADEMICS   The undergraduate program in Paris provides a rich introduction to historic and present-day France through classroom studies and diverse extracurricular activities. Intensive French language classes, offered at all levels, are taught by instructors with native proficiency. Faculty who teach French civilization courses (offered in English or in French), provide exceptional academic instruction. Courses include field trips to culturally significant sites in the city.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students must stay in NYU provided housing. Participants in the summer undergraduate program are housed in a residence hall in a lively neighborhood close to the historic neighborhoods of the Marais and the Bastille, and within easy commuting distance to the NYU academic center.   All classes are held at the centrally located NYU Paris Center, comprised of classrooms, a student lounge, a lecture hall, and computer terminals for student use. Students are also strongly recommended to bring their own laptop computers. The NYU Paris staff helps students make the most of their summer in Paris. Full-time staff includes the Resident Director of NYU Paris, Academic and Student Life Staff, and an on-site Counselor.           EXCURSIONS      To enhance students' academic experience, NYU Paris hosts several lectures throughout the summer session that bring together French and Francophone artists, scholars, and activists. Cultural activities such as neighborhood walking tours, visits to world famous museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, and attendance at numerous ballet, concert, and theatre performances are scheduled to complement the academic program. Excursions further complete the cultural calendar: activities planned for 2015 may include day trips to Chartres, Giverny, and the D-Day beaches in Normandy.

This course explores photography from the 1830s to the present day, emphasizing style and subject matter (rather than technical processes) in the work of the major photographers. We will consider how photography has enlarged and affected our vision and knowledge of the world, and how photography has influenced and been influenced by other modes of artistic expression (theatre, film, literature, the fine arts). In addition, we will consider photography as it is defined through a variety of means, from political documentary to fashion photography to advertising. Visits to photography exhibits in and outside of Paris will form an integral part of this course. Sample syllabus .

Using the resources of Paris and its surrounding neighborhoods, this course examines a wealth of art movements (realism, the Barbizon School, impressionism, neoimpressionism, postimpressionism, the Nabis, and cubism) as they were formed in the 19th and 20th centuries. The second half of the course focuses on changes in the art world during the first half of the 20th century, with particular attention on the dada movement, surrealism, abstract expressionism, and other movements that influenced and changed major art capitals of the world. Field trips include visits to the Orsay Museum with its superb reconstruction of 19th-century aesthetic life, the 17th-century private palace that now houses the Picasso collection, and the incomparable Louvre, among others.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Cultures and Contexts: Spain \u0097At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America - CORE-UA 9544 - 4 points                               Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Sample Syllabus                                                                      Foundations of Finance - FINC-UB 9002 - 4 points                               Prerequisites: (1) STAT-UB 103 Statistics for Business Control and Regression/Forecasting Models OR STAT-UB 1 Statistics for Business Control (4 credit) plus STAT-UB 3 Regression/Forecasting (2 credit) OR equivalent AND (2) one of the following: ECON-UB 1 Microeconomics OR ECON-UA 2 Economic Principles II, OR ECON-UA 5 Introduction to Economic Analysis, AND (3) ACCT-UB 1 Principles of Financial Accounting AND (4) At least Sophomore Standing.   A rigorous course developing the basic concepts and tools of modern finance. Basic concepts of return and risk are explored in detail with a view to understanding how financial markets work and how different kinds of financial instruments are valued. These instruments, including equities, fixed income securities, options, and other derivative securities become vehicles for exploring various financial markets and the utilization of these markets by managers in different kinds of financial institutions to enhance return and manage risk. The course includes a segment on the use and application of computer-based quantitative technology for financial modeling purposes.                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               Evaluates, from the management point of view, marketing as a system for the satisfaction of human wants and as a catalyst of business activity. Deals with the subject at all levels from producer to consumer and emphasizes the planning required for the efficient use of marketing tools in the development and expansion of markets. Concentrates on the principles, functions, and tools of marketing, including quantitative methods. Utilizes cases and projects to develop a problem-solving ability in dealing with specific areas.

This 4 credit course includes a weekly seminar and a minimum of 16 hours of fieldwork per week (two full days). Internship placements are made by EUSA, an internship placement organization partnering with NYU.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.     Sample Syllabus coming soon                                                                          The Politics of Climate Change - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               This course examines the interaction between two coupled systems, the Earth system and humanity\u2019s political systems. Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Modern Spanish Poetry in Context - SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               Course description coming soon.                                                                    Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

Virtually all your college courses require you to write papers or reports, but courses offered by the Expository Writing Program are opportunities to concentrate intensely on the process of writing. The Expository Writing Program assumes that writing is not merely a useful skill but also a way of learning and knowing. Its courses focus on the examination of evidence, the development of ideas, and the clear expression of those ideas in a variety of different kinds of essays. In these writing courses, students routinely move from exploration to argument as they read and make use of various texts\u2014written, visual, experiential\u2014to create a spectrum of persuasive essays. Examined texts become more complex, and the writing tasks more difficult, as students grapple with intriguing questions that lead to richer ideas and more interesting forms of expression. The essays students write become more formal and argumentative as the semester\u2019s work progresses. Additional information, requirements and course descriptions appear on the Expository Writing Program website.     Foreign Language The study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as government, business, and research. NYU is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its rapidly expanding opportunities for study abroad. To fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum, students must show or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence (see list of courses below). Some languages are also taught in intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages are encouraged to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Students of all languages, ancient or modern, are encouraged to continue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. Exemptions: Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum by presenting outstanding scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test in a foreign language, or by passing a departmental proficiency examination. For further information on language placement and exemption, and for Advanced Placement Test equivalencies, consult your advisor or the College of Arts and Science Bulletin (available online from the CAS website). Students whose secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than a language offered in the College, or who complete the International Writing Workshop sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, International Writing Workshop I; and EXPOS-UA 9, International Writing Workshop II), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the B.S./B.E. program. In addition to the foreign languages courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportunities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, non-credit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, contact the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909.\u2028    Foreign Language Courses Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study. Intensive courses, which allow students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year, are also listed where available.

For more information on specific language classes, placement, or exemption, please contact the language coordinator, director of language programs, or director of undergraduate studies named in the individual departmental listings. Thanks to an exchange arrangement with Columbia University, students may also enroll in the following languages, offered through the intermediate level and given at Columbia: Armenian, Bengali, Catalan, Czech (Elementary I and II are offered in the College; intermediate-level courses are offered at Columbia), Dutch, Finnish, Georgian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Kannada, Polish, Punjabi, Romanian, Sanskrit, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Modern Tibetan, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof, and Zulu. For information about these courses, visit the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908 or click here for more information.    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture is the arts, humanities, and social sciences component of the College Core Curriculum. Within each of its components, students are free to pursue their interests through their choice of classes. The structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information below, to learn more about FCC courses, we strongly recommend that you browse past and present syllabuses. Texts and Ideas Texts and Ideas is the name for a diverse group of humanities courses that study challenging, influential texts about big ideas: freedom, the nature of the soul, the place of humans in the natural and animal world, beauty, citizenship, morality, the imagination, the use of the past, and many more. Some courses explore a single theme or a set of closely related ideas; others investigate the relationship between two periods of intellectual history, for example, selected writings in the philosophy and literature of ancient Greece and Rome and their reception in a later era. Texts and Ideas courses also seek to refine students\u2019 ability to write and speak about complex concepts and arguments with clarity, originality, and eloquence. You will be challenged not only to master the content of some of the world\u2019s most influential philosophical texts and works of literature, but to discuss how the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropriated, or rejected over time. Cultures and Contexts Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways humans see themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional groups. Individual courses focus on political, social, or cultural collectives that are distinct from the dominant traditions of contemporary North America, such as central Asia, Russia, Korea, or ancient Egypt; some courses study diaspora formations and emergent traditions. Primary texts are central to every course, with some faculty concentrating on historical documents, others on art, film, or literary texts. Cultures and Contexts courses share a common aim to examine the ways cultures emerge and interact through trade, colonization, immigration, religious proselytization, and representation in various media; how groups define themselves through beliefs, values, and customs; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects comprehension of the ways in which premodern or non-Western peoples experience and imagine their lives.  Societies and the Social Sciences We live in a world molded by massive social, political, and economic transformations, and to be thoughtful, responsible citizens we need to understand them. From the nineteenth century to today, drawing on earlier movements, thinkers have developed new methods for understanding the complexity of these phenomena by studying societal structures and human behavior. Societies and the Social Sciences is our name for a set of courses offered by social science departments across the Faculty of Arts and Science\u2014Anthropology, Social and Cultural Analysis, Economics, Politics, History, Linguistics, Psychology, Religious Studies, and Sociology. Students fulfill the requirement by taking one of a list of designated courses or by majoring or minoring in the social sciences. Expressive Culture Art arouses pleasure, wonder, confusion, curiosity, and many other things. How is art made, and for what purpose? How do artworks convey meaning or feelings? How does social context shape the making of art? In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression by focusing on one of five media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social and political life. Our teaching is fueled by our passion for fostering life-long appreciation of the arts, and New York City is the ideal place to experience them in all their variety. Whenever possible, faculty draw on the rich cultural resources of the city around us.    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is the mathematics and natural science component of the College Core Curriculum. Rather than providing a routine coverage of facts, FSI courses stress the process and applications of quantitative and scientific thinking. The design of these courses is based on the conviction that science is interesting, accessible, and important for all undergraduates. FSI courses encourage students to approach science as a way of knowing, a quest to understand who we are and our place in the universe. They also provide you with a foundation to make informed decisions\u2014both personal and societal\u2014as citizens of a world that is increasingly influenced by science and technology. No matter what career path you choose, the study of science will enrich your critical thinking skills and expand your appreciation of the natural world. Quantitative Reasoning Mathematics is both a curiosity-driven endeavor and a powerful analytical tool. Mathematics strives to deduce universal rules that govern numbers, geometry, and logic. When applied to the analysis of data, mathematics allows us to derive conclusions, for example, about the likelihood of random events or the effectiveness of medical therapies. In today\u2019s data-driven world we are constantly bombarded with numbers, from projections of the national debt to the likelihood of catching the flu, so citizens of the 21st century need an ability to critically evaluate numerical information. The Core\u2019s Quantitative Reasoning courses provide you with the mathematical foundations and analytical skills to investigate, evaluate, and draw conclusions from numerical evidence. Natural Science I Natural Science I describes a range of courses that examine the foundations of the physical sciences\u2014physics and chemistry. At its core, the physical sciences seek to understand the role of matter and energy in explaining a broad range of phenomena, such as the large scale structure of the universe and the factors that affect the earth\u2019s climate. These investigations require the application of mathematical tools to quantify and predict our complex world. Natural Science I courses examine questions at the cutting edge of scientific investigation: What fundamental insights do scientists hope to gain from the Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most complex scientific experiment ever performed? Why have astronomers propose the unseen existence of dark matter and dark energy? What do investigations into the Earth\u2019s historical climate reveal about the scope of global climate change in the 20th and 21st centuries? Do renewable energy sources provide a feasible global alternative to fossil fuels? Natural Science II Natural Science II encapsulates a variety of courses that examine the broad diversity of life sciences\u2014biology, neuroscience, and physical anthropology. We are currently witnessing an explosion of information in the life sciences, stimulated by the development of new tools such as DNA technologies, computer databases, and brain scanners. These new insights have thrust science into the forefront of social, ethical, and legal debates on such topics as stem cell research, the evidence for evolution, the preservation of biodiversity, and the neurological basis of decision making. Each Natural Science II course uses a thematic approach to introduce students to the foundations and frontiers of scientific investigation in the life sciences.
