The undergraduate division of the Department of Film and Television combines professional training with studies in the liberal arts, leading to the B.F.A. degree. The graduate division of the Department offers a three-year M.F.A curriculum in intensive professional filmmaking focusing on preproduction, production, postproduction, writing, directing, aesthetics, and the entertainment business. New York University's Graduate Film Program , offered in both New York and Singapore, is an intensive three-year conservatory which trains students in the art of cinematic storytelling. We focus on helping writer/directors develop a narrative voice and the technical virtuosity to express that voice in cinema.      The Rita &amp; Burton Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing is a highly focused academic and professional writing program for undergraduate and graduate students, committed to the rigorous training of writers for theatre, film and television.    The Department of Cinema Studies is one of the first university departments in the world devoted to the history, theory, and aesthetics of film and the moving image. The Department offers programs leading to the B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. in cinema studies, and the M.A. in moving image archiving and preservation. The Skirball Center also houses the William K. Everson Film Collection, containing over 4,000 feature-length films and a like number of short subjects spanning every filmmaking genre, along with an extensive manuscript collection of original scripts, autobiographical materials, correspondence and ephemera; the holdings are particularly strong in materials documenting the silent film era. Cinema Studies recently underwent major renovations and offers state-of-the-art facilities for the study of film and the moving image.
