The strategy specialization is designed for students who will pursue careers in strategy consulting or corporate strategic planning departments. Careers oriented toward general business management, entrepreneurship, and investment banking also will benefit from greater depth in strategy coursework. The courses in this specialization provide students with cutting-edge theories and practice on such topics as value creation and capture, external analysis of industries, internal analysis of a firm\u2019s competitive strengths and weaknesses, competitive positioning, multimarket and corporate strategy, strategic decision-making, and strategy implementation.
