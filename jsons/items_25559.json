Please read the FAQs below to learn more about this option that is being offered in the Undergraduate Reapplication and Room Selection process .                                 Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            What does \"gender assignment preference\" mean?                                                       Indicating a &quot;gender neutral&quot; assignment preference allows for upperclass students to form room selection groups and/or select room spaces without regard to legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Why has NYU created the \"neutral\" gender assignment preference?                                                       The Inter-Residence Hall Council, with a student Gender Neutral Task Force, made a proposal last year for increased gender inclusion in the housing process for upperclass students. This proposal has been used to help define and implement a gender neutral housing option.                                                                                                                                                                          What is the difference between co-ed housing and gender neutral housing?                                                       The term co-ed operates on the assumption that there are two genders: male and female. It leaves little room for the progressive theories on gender, and no room for those who do not identify as their biological sex or those who are transgender. This idea of gender neutral housing is based on the notion that there are more than two genders, in fact an infinite amount. Allowing for gender neutral housing, as opposed to co-ed, shows more inclusiveness and room for diverse identities.                                                                                                                                                                          What other universities have gender neutral housing options?                                                       Over 100 universities offer Gender Neutral Housing options on their campuses. Here are just some of those universities:   Columbia University   Harvard University   Princeton University     Rutgers University   Stanford University   University of California                                                                                                                                                                          Who can indicate a gender neutral assignment preference?                                                       Any student that is eligible for the Undergraduate Housing Reapplication and Room Selection process will have the opportunity to select the gender neutral housing option. This option is not available to new freshmen living in FYRE communities.                                                                                                                                                                          Is this preference offered to first year students?                                                       The Gender Neutral housing option is only being offered as part of the returning undergraduate process at this time. Geographic diversity is a variable in the room assignment process for first year students in order to promote global citizenship and prepare students to take an active role in the Global Network University. Since this policy will directly impact a student\u2019s ability to request another incoming student as a roommate, the Gender Neutral option is not being offered to first year students. However, the Gender Identity assignment preference is still a part of the first year application and assignment process.                                                                                                                                                                          What is NYU's default assignment method if the gender neutral assignment preference is not selected/available?                                                       Room assignments are made by New York University on the basis of the legal sex of the student, which is the sex that appears on government issued IDs or legal documents.                                                                                                                                                                          I want my roommate to be of a different gender than myself. Will preferencing gender neutral guarantee this?                                                       Though students will be able to group and/or select rooms without regard to legal sex, we are unable to guarantee that you will room with someone of a different gender. If an individual indicates a gender neutral assignment preference without a specific roommate request, they will be able to select into suites that have been opened by other students who have selected gender neutral housing. In addition, if a gender neutral suite cannot be filled with students that have opted into the gender neutral option, the members of the suite will need to be re-assigned based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Will I be forced to live with in a mixed-gender room/apartment?                                                       No. Students will still have the option to group and select rooms based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Which halls will have gender neutral housing?                                                       Students will be able to select into any available hall via the regular Room Selection process.                                                                                                                                                                          Will indicating a gender neutral preference increase my chances of getting an apartment or building that I want?                                                       No. Students who select the Gender Neutral option will receive their selection times based on the same priority system as students who choose to group and/or select based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          What will the duration of a gender neutral housing assignment?                                                       Participants will commit to living in a gender neutral housing suite for one full academic year.                                                                                                                                                                        Can I change my gender assignment preference?                                                       During the Room Selection process, students can change their preference between &quot;neutral&quot; or their legal sex, however, this may affect the ability of group members to be assigned together. If their gender assignment preferences no longer match, they will not be able to select into the same suite.                                                                                                                                                                          What will happen to the remaining suitemates in the event that a vacancy occurs in a gender neutral apartment?                                                       If a vacancy occurs, the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services reserves the right to one of the following: place an \u201cunassigned\u201d gender neutral housing applicant into the suite, leave the vacancy open and combine two or more under-capacity suites, or convert the room to a single legal-sex room. This decision will be made at the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services\u2019 discretion but reasonable accommodations will be made wherever possible.                                                                                                                                                                          Is this only for students who are members of the LGBTQ community?                                                       No. Gender Neutral Housing is an option for any student who wishes to group and/or select a room without regard to legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Will you prevent people who are romantically involved from living together?                                                       Gender Neutral Housing is not intended for romantic couples, however, we respect and honor the privacy of our students. Current housing procedures do not require students to disclose the reason for their roommate requests. We encourage students to make mature decisions about their living arrangements, and make roommate choices that will help them experience a successful academic year.                                                                                                                                                                          What if parents don\u2019t want their student to live in a gender neutral room?                                                       We encourage students to maintain an open dialogue with their families so that they can be supportive of a student\u2019s housing decision.

Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            What does \"gender assignment preference\" mean?                                                       Indicating a &quot;gender neutral&quot; assignment preference allows for upperclass students to form room selection groups and/or select room spaces without regard to legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Why has NYU created the \"neutral\" gender assignment preference?                                                       The Inter-Residence Hall Council, with a student Gender Neutral Task Force, made a proposal last year for increased gender inclusion in the housing process for upperclass students. This proposal has been used to help define and implement a gender neutral housing option.                                                                                                                                                                          What is the difference between co-ed housing and gender neutral housing?                                                       The term co-ed operates on the assumption that there are two genders: male and female. It leaves little room for the progressive theories on gender, and no room for those who do not identify as their biological sex or those who are transgender. This idea of gender neutral housing is based on the notion that there are more than two genders, in fact an infinite amount. Allowing for gender neutral housing, as opposed to co-ed, shows more inclusiveness and room for diverse identities.                                                                                                                                                                          What other universities have gender neutral housing options?                                                       Over 100 universities offer Gender Neutral Housing options on their campuses. Here are just some of those universities:   Columbia University   Harvard University   Princeton University     Rutgers University   Stanford University   University of California                                                                                                                                                                          Who can indicate a gender neutral assignment preference?                                                       Any student that is eligible for the Undergraduate Housing Reapplication and Room Selection process will have the opportunity to select the gender neutral housing option. This option is not available to new freshmen living in FYRE communities.                                                                                                                                                                          Is this preference offered to first year students?                                                       The Gender Neutral housing option is only being offered as part of the returning undergraduate process at this time. Geographic diversity is a variable in the room assignment process for first year students in order to promote global citizenship and prepare students to take an active role in the Global Network University. Since this policy will directly impact a student\u2019s ability to request another incoming student as a roommate, the Gender Neutral option is not being offered to first year students. However, the Gender Identity assignment preference is still a part of the first year application and assignment process.                                                                                                                                                                          What is NYU's default assignment method if the gender neutral assignment preference is not selected/available?                                                       Room assignments are made by New York University on the basis of the legal sex of the student, which is the sex that appears on government issued IDs or legal documents.                                                                                                                                                                          I want my roommate to be of a different gender than myself. Will preferencing gender neutral guarantee this?                                                       Though students will be able to group and/or select rooms without regard to legal sex, we are unable to guarantee that you will room with someone of a different gender. If an individual indicates a gender neutral assignment preference without a specific roommate request, they will be able to select into suites that have been opened by other students who have selected gender neutral housing. In addition, if a gender neutral suite cannot be filled with students that have opted into the gender neutral option, the members of the suite will need to be re-assigned based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Will I be forced to live with in a mixed-gender room/apartment?                                                       No. Students will still have the option to group and select rooms based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Which halls will have gender neutral housing?                                                       Students will be able to select into any available hall via the regular Room Selection process.                                                                                                                                                                          Will indicating a gender neutral preference increase my chances of getting an apartment or building that I want?                                                       No. Students who select the Gender Neutral option will receive their selection times based on the same priority system as students who choose to group and/or select based on their legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          What will the duration of a gender neutral housing assignment?                                                       Participants will commit to living in a gender neutral housing suite for one full academic year.                                                                                                                                                                        Can I change my gender assignment preference?                                                       During the Room Selection process, students can change their preference between &quot;neutral&quot; or their legal sex, however, this may affect the ability of group members to be assigned together. If their gender assignment preferences no longer match, they will not be able to select into the same suite.                                                                                                                                                                          What will happen to the remaining suitemates in the event that a vacancy occurs in a gender neutral apartment?                                                       If a vacancy occurs, the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services reserves the right to one of the following: place an \u201cunassigned\u201d gender neutral housing applicant into the suite, leave the vacancy open and combine two or more under-capacity suites, or convert the room to a single legal-sex room. This decision will be made at the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services\u2019 discretion but reasonable accommodations will be made wherever possible.                                                                                                                                                                          Is this only for students who are members of the LGBTQ community?                                                       No. Gender Neutral Housing is an option for any student who wishes to group and/or select a room without regard to legal sex.                                                                                                                                                                          Will you prevent people who are romantically involved from living together?                                                       Gender Neutral Housing is not intended for romantic couples, however, we respect and honor the privacy of our students. Current housing procedures do not require students to disclose the reason for their roommate requests. We encourage students to make mature decisions about their living arrangements, and make roommate choices that will help them experience a successful academic year.                                                                                                                                                                          What if parents don\u2019t want their student to live in a gender neutral room?                                                       We encourage students to maintain an open dialogue with their families so that they can be supportive of a student\u2019s housing decision.

This site is no longer being maintained!      I have not been affiliated with NYU since 2006, when I founded Perceptive Pixel               Research Interests:    I am a consulting research scientist for NYU's Department of Computer Science,   currently working with Yann Lecun on various autonomous robot navigation projects,   while also finding time to direct some of my own research.       Over the years, I've also worked with several other professors at Courant,   including Ken Perlin on great projects like the Kaleidoscope,   with Denis Zorin on mesh simulation, and with Chris Bregler on motion capture.       My research interests have historically been real-time computer graphics and real-time computer vision,   but I've taken on a more recent focus on human-computer interfaces and machine learning.
