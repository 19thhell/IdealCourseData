It also imparts strong analytical and interpretative skills and an enhanced understanding of cross-cultural change and contrasts. The major is at once structured and attuned to the skills, knowledge, and interests of individual students. Students design a coherent yet personalized sequence of courses in consultation with their departmental adviser (appointed upon declaring the major). A semester- or year-long stay in the NYU Paris program is an integral dimension of the major. If this proves impossible, summer study is highly advised. The Director of Undergraduate Studies assigns each major a permanent faculty adviser within the department. The adviser helps the student plan a course of study in line with her interests (literature, culture, Francophone). Majors must meet with their adviser at least once per semester to obtain clearance for the following semester. When students are abroad, the process takes place via email. The prerequisite for admission to the major the completion of Conversation and Composition (FREN-UA 30) with a grade of B- or better (or an equivalent course or exam). No grade lower than C may be counted toward the major. Credits in AP French language (4 or 5) exempt students from Conversation and Composition; credits in AP French Literature (4 or 5) exempt students from one section of Readings in French Literature. Undergraduates taking French find an intellectually stimulating and congenial atmosphere in which to pursue their studies. Caf\u00e9 et Conversation and Cin\u00e9-Club events and informal conversation groups held at La Maison Fran\u00e7aise afford opportunities for social and cultural interaction. The Department of French is proud of the number of undergraduates who have been elected to Pi Delta Phi, the national French Honor Society. Placement Exams In order to ensure that students are placed in the appropriate course for their language level, students must demonstrate their French language skills through one of four placement options: (1.) the SAT Subject test in French, which may be completed prior to enrollment or in-person at NYU after arrival on campus, (2.) the AP French Language and Culture Exam, (3.) the IB French Test (high level), or (4.) the WebCAPE Online Placement Exam .
