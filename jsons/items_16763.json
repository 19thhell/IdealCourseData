Sample Courses:  Students should refer to a current class schedule each semester to   determine current course offerings.The list below is representative, not exhaustive.  Introduction to the City I G65.1108 Introduces   the complex nature of the city and the local and global political,   social, and economic forces that shape it. As these forces manifest   themselves differently in different localities, students study various   city types, including the global city, the modern metropolis, and the   informal city. New York City is the main platform for exploration,   revealing as it does the continuities and congruencies in the forms and   processes that characterize contemporary cities. Garbage in   Gotham: The Anthropology of Trash G65.1813 Traces changing   definitions of value and worthlessness through Enlightenment, modern,   and postmodern theory. Considers these through the perspective of trash,   which is read as a reflection of contemporary social mores, time/space   compression, and fragmentations of cultural identity, among other   themes. Uses New York City as a case study. Introduction to the City II G65.2108 Students   learn various approaches for studying the city by transforming a topic   of interest into a researchable question, developing a research design,   and identifying the most appropriate methods for their chosen research   project. An overview of qualitative research methods is provided, both   through the examination of existing studies and the development of the   students\u2019 own projects. Topics   in the City: A Brief History of Urban Consciousness G65.3003 Starting   with Walter Benjamin\u2019s submission of the flaneur as the prototypical   subject of the modern metropolis, theorists have debated the   Eurocentric, hetero-normative, and bourgeois assumptions that underlie   such as framing of urban subjectivity. Indeed, post-structuralism,   feminist geography, queer theory and subaltern studies have staged   valuable interventions into this original thesis of urban consciousness   as submitted by Benjamin. This course is arranged around the central   premise that understanding urban space requires and interrogation of the   particular subjectivities that it produces and a sustained exploration   of the dialectic between subject and city.  Topics in the City   seminars examine particularly focused subject matter and themes, which   change frequently.
