Oftentimes the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students \u2013 a full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, internship commitments, and social obligations. This busy time forces students to focus mainly on their academic progress which doesn\u2019t always allow freedom to explore a new interest or take advantage of the many cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City.   January Term provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major, minor, or elective) in courses that are in high\u2013demand, to accelerate degree completion and to concentrate on personal interests.
