Forty-five DDS students participated.   Anatomy Club mentor and an associate director of NYUCD\u2019s CDE implant dentistry program, Dr. Robert Bagoff, and nine CDE implant dentistry faculty led the event, which featured lectures and hands-on experiences in guided tissue regeneration, bone grafting, and implant placement in a very high-level forum.
