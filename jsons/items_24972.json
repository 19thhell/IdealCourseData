If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

In addition, if you applied for financial aid, your financial aid estimate will be available through the NYUAlbert student information system.     Activate your NYU NetID and create your password.  If you have not already done so, you must activate your NYU NetID and create a password. If you have already activated your NYU NetID and created a password, you can skip to step 2. If not, follow this step first:    You have been assigned a NetID, included in your admission letter. Your NetID is used to sign in to systems at NYU. To activate this NetID and set your password, go to the NYU Information Technology Services (ITS) Start page at http://start.nyu.edu . Enter your NetID, click &quot;start,&quot; and follow the online instructions. To complete the process, you will also need your date of birth and your NYU University ID number. Your NYU University ID is also in your admission letter.       Sign in to NYUHome.  NYUHome is a portal of entry to access NYU services online. Your username is your NetID, and your password is the one you have just created. NYUHome can be accessed at http://home.nyu.edu/academics .       View your financial aid estimate.  If you did not apply for financial aid, you may skip to step 4.    If you did apply for financial aid, you may view your estimated award in NYUAlbert, the university\u2019s online student information system. From the main page of NYUHome, click the \u201cAcademics\u201d tab, then click on \u201cApplicant Login\u201d, followed by \u201cAccept/Decline Financial Aid\u201d. You may then select \u201c2016\u201d to view your financial aid estimate and related award messages. Please read the award messages carefully.    You will have access to your financial aid estimate provided you filed a CSS/Financial Aid Profile by the January 15th deadline and are otherwise eligible. If you are a US citizen or US Permanent Resident attending our New York campus, you must file a 2015-2016 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) no later than February 15, in order to secure any offered Early Decision financial aid award. It is very important that you complete the process by February 15. Please make a note to file on time to ensure your eligibility! If you are an international student receiving financial aid, you do not need to complete the FAFSA since you are not eligible to do so.    We recognize that NYU is an investment in your education and requires a significant financial commitment, therefore it is important that you take the time to review information regarding financial aid. You are encouraged to consider the cost over your entire undergraduate career at NYU and become familiar with the criteria for renewing scholarship each year, including adhering to future award deadlines and meeting satisfactory academic progress standards. Essential information can be found in the NYU Financial Aid Guide . Please pay attention to the \u201cScholarship and Grant\u201d section where the scholarship renewal criteria is outlined in detail.    We also encourage you to become knowledgeable about responsibilities associated with any federal loans you pursue, including such details as interest rates and repayment expectations, as well as information about other options which may assist you in financing your education, such as payment plans.    While exact costs for 2015-2016 will not be available until late spring 2015, current academic year costs are available for your reference on the Office of Financial Aid website.    If you have any questions about your financial aid award, please contact the Office of Financial Aid directly at +1 212-998-4444 or by email at financial.aid@nyu.edu .       Respond to your offer of admission and confirm your enrollment.   All admitted students should respond to our offer of admission by either accepting or declining.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

In addition, if you applied for financial aid, your financial aid estimate will be available through the NYUAlbert student information system.     Activate your NYU NetID and create your password.  If you have not already done so, you must activate your NYU NetID and create a password. If you have already activated your NYU NetID and created a password, you can skip to step 2. If not, follow this step first:    You have been assigned a NetID, included in your admission letter. Your NetID is used to sign in to systems at NYU. To activate this NetID and set your password, go to the NYU Information Technology Services (ITS) Start page at http://start.nyu.edu . Enter your NetID, click &quot;start,&quot; and follow the online instructions. To complete the process, you will also need your date of birth and your NYU University ID number. Your NYU University ID is also in your admission letter.       Sign in to NYUHome.  NYUHome is a portal of entry to access NYU services online. Your username is your NetID, and your password is the one you have just created. NYUHome can be accessed at http://home.nyu.edu/academics .       View your financial aid estimate.  If you did not apply for financial aid, you may skip to step 4.    If you did apply for financial aid, you may view your estimated award in NYUAlbert, the university\u2019s online student information system. From the main page of NYUHome, click the \u201cAcademics\u201d tab, then click on \u201cApplicant Login\u201d, followed by \u201cAccept/Decline Financial Aid\u201d. You may then select \u201c2016\u201d to view your financial aid estimate and related award messages. Please read the award messages carefully.    You will have access to your financial aid estimate provided you filed a CSS/Financial Aid Profile by the January 15th deadline and are otherwise eligible. If you are a US citizen or US Permanent Resident attending our New York campus, you must file a 2015-2016 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) no later than February 15, in order to secure any offered Early Decision financial aid award. It is very important that you complete the process by February 15. Please make a note to file on time to ensure your eligibility! If you are an international student receiving financial aid, you do not need to complete the FAFSA since you are not eligible to do so.    We recognize that NYU is an investment in your education and requires a significant financial commitment, therefore it is important that you take the time to review information regarding financial aid. You are encouraged to consider the cost over your entire undergraduate career at NYU and become familiar with the criteria for renewing scholarship each year, including adhering to future award deadlines and meeting satisfactory academic progress standards. Essential information can be found in the NYU Financial Aid Guide . Please pay attention to the \u201cScholarship and Grant\u201d section where the scholarship renewal criteria is outlined in detail.    We also encourage you to become knowledgeable about responsibilities associated with any federal loans you pursue, including such details as interest rates and repayment expectations, as well as information about other options which may assist you in financing your education, such as payment plans.    While exact costs for 2015-2016 will not be available until late spring 2015, current academic year costs are available for your reference on the Office of Financial Aid website.

If you haven\u2019t been able to tell from my previous blog posts, I really love my job. From traveling to exciting parts of the country and the world to learning all about students through their applications, I get to do a lot of cool stuff as an admissions counselor. But I don\u2019t think anything is as cool, or as fun as our annual Weekend on the Square (WOTS) admitted student event.

To say I was excited to travel to China to see NYU Shanghai for the first time would be an understatement (my colleague and I had a countdown on his phone for months!) and the experience did not disappoint.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes.

In addition, if you applied for financial aid, your financial aid estimate will be available through the NYUAlbert student information system.     Activate your NYU NetID and create your password.  If you have not already done so, you must activate your NYU NetID and create a password. If you have already activated your NYU NetID and created a password, you can skip to step 2. If not, follow this step first:    You have been assigned a NetID, included in your admission letter. Your NetID is used to sign in to systems at NYU. To activate this NetID and set your password, go to the NYU Information Technology Services (ITS) Start page at http://start.nyu.edu . Enter your NetID, click &quot;start,&quot; and follow the online instructions. To complete the process, you will also need your date of birth and your NYU University ID number. Your NYU University ID is also in your admission letter.       Sign in to NYUHome.  NYUHome is a portal of entry to access NYU services online. Your username is your NetID, and your password is the one you have just created. NYUHome can be accessed at http://home.nyu.edu/academics .       View your financial aid estimate.  If you did not apply for financial aid, you may skip to step 4.    If you did apply for financial aid, you may view your estimated award in NYUAlbert, the university\u2019s online student information system. From the main page of NYUHome, click the \u201cAcademics\u201d tab, then click on \u201cApplicant Login\u201d, followed by \u201cAccept/Decline Financial Aid\u201d. You may then select \u201c2016\u201d to view your financial aid estimate and related award messages. Please read the award messages carefully.    You will have access to your financial aid estimate provided you filed a CSS/Financial Aid Profile by the January 15th deadline and are otherwise eligible. If you are a US citizen or US Permanent Resident attending our New York campus, you must file a 2015-2016 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) no later than February 15, in order to secure any offered Early Decision financial aid award. It is very important that you complete the process by February 15. Please make a note to file on time to ensure your eligibility! If you are an international student receiving financial aid, you do not need to complete the FAFSA since you are not eligible to do so.    We recognize that NYU is an investment in your education and requires a significant financial commitment, therefore it is important that you take the time to review information regarding financial aid. You are encouraged to consider the cost over your entire undergraduate career at NYU and become familiar with the criteria for renewing scholarship each year, including adhering to future award deadlines and meeting satisfactory academic progress standards. Essential information can be found in the NYU Financial Aid Guide . Please pay attention to the \u201cScholarship and Grant\u201d section where the scholarship renewal criteria is outlined in detail.    We also encourage you to become knowledgeable about responsibilities associated with any federal loans you pursue, including such details as interest rates and repayment expectations, as well as information about other options which may assist you in financing your education, such as payment plans.    While exact costs for 2015-2016 will not be available until late spring 2015, current academic year costs are available for your reference on the Office of Financial Aid website.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

In addition, if you applied for financial aid, your financial aid estimate will be available through the NYUAlbert student information system.     Activate your NYU NetID and create your password.  If you have not already done so, you must activate your NYU NetID and create a password. If you have already activated your NYU NetID and created a password, you can skip to step 2. If not, follow this step first:    You have been assigned a NetID, included in your admission letter. Your NetID is used to sign in to systems at NYU. To activate this NetID and set your password, go to the NYU Information Technology Services (ITS) Start page at http://start.nyu.edu . Enter your NetID, click &quot;start,&quot; and follow the online instructions. To complete the process, you will also need your date of birth and your NYU University ID number. Your NYU University ID is also in your admission letter.       Sign in to NYUHome.  NYUHome is a portal of entry to access NYU services online. Your username is your NetID, and your password is the one you have just created. NYUHome can be accessed at http://home.nyu.edu/academics .       View your financial aid estimate.  If you did not apply for financial aid, you may skip to step 4.    If you did apply for financial aid, you may view your estimated award in NYUAlbert, the university\u2019s online student information system. From the main page of NYUHome, click the \u201cAcademics\u201d tab, then click on \u201cApplicant Login\u201d, followed by \u201cAccept/Decline Financial Aid\u201d. You may then select \u201c2016\u201d to view your financial aid estimate and related award messages. Please read the award messages carefully.    You will have access to your financial aid estimate provided you filed a CSS/Financial Aid Profile by the January 15th deadline and are otherwise eligible. If you are a US citizen or US Permanent Resident attending our New York campus, you must file a 2015-2016 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) no later than February 15, in order to secure any offered Early Decision financial aid award. It is very important that you complete the process by February 15. Please make a note to file on time to ensure your eligibility! If you are an international student receiving financial aid, you do not need to complete the FAFSA since you are not eligible to do so.    We recognize that NYU is an investment in your education and requires a significant financial commitment, therefore it is important that you take the time to review information regarding financial aid. You are encouraged to consider the cost over your entire undergraduate career at NYU and become familiar with the criteria for renewing scholarship each year, including adhering to future award deadlines and meeting satisfactory academic progress standards. Essential information can be found in the NYU Financial Aid Guide . Please pay attention to the \u201cScholarship and Grant\u201d section where the scholarship renewal criteria is outlined in detail.    We also encourage you to become knowledgeable about responsibilities associated with any federal loans you pursue, including such details as interest rates and repayment expectations, as well as information about other options which may assist you in financing your education, such as payment plans.    While exact costs for 2015-2016 will not be available until late spring 2015, current academic year costs are available for your reference on the Office of Financial Aid website.
