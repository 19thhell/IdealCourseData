Intended to widen the horizons of the creative filmmaker, we will analyze documentary traditions with a specific focus on the narrative techniques used in the telling of powerful stories. Alongside, we will examine contemporary fiction films that have broken new grounds by a creative absorption and sometimes exploitation of the documentary method. These include films that deliberately confound fact and fiction, include improvisations, dramatic reconstructions and are occasionally downright mock-docs. We will examine the \"truth claims\" and \"reality principles\" of a wide-ranging, eclectic body of international cinema, both fiction and documentary, and in doing so, will recast the definition of 'documentary' today.
