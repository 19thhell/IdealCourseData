Africana Studies is an interdisciplinary undertaking devoted to scholarship on the histories, political and cultural movements, institutions, economies and identities of Africans and the African diaspora across the globe. Africa\u2019s own overlapping modernities and the transnational migrations of its peoples &ndash; whether forced or voluntary &ndash; have complicated the meanings of \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cAfrican\u201d identities and experiences, prompting us to rethink the geographical boundaries and conceptual paradigms surrounding the production of knowledge about Africa and its diasporic communities.      NYU's location in one of the western hemisphere\u2019s most cosmopolitan cities &ndash; home to many of the broad constituencies we aim to study in relation to their other continental settings &ndash; places us in a privileged position to lead and shape the development of Africana Studies in the 21st century. Accordingly, the program is a site for interdisciplinary and cross-cultural teaching and research in the histories, cultures, economies, politics, and languages and cultural practices of Africans in Africa, the Americas\u2013North and South, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle-East. The program maintains close relationships with community programming and research activities by NYU's Institute of African-American Affairs and Africa House.
