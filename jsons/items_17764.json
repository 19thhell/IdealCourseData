Back to top    MSMS-GA 2222 Conservation and Collections Management Elective. 4 points. This seminar combines classroom discussion with museum visits to provide an understanding of preventive care, collections conservation, and collections management. It covers the historical and philosophical drive to preserve cultural objects for the future, and value conflicts that arise between professionals and non-professionals with stakes in how material culture is exhibited. The seminar addresses concerns of living artists as well as indigenous groups and others with claims to the disposition and care of cultural materials. It also covers collections management policies and procedures, including environmental management, disaster management, and collections documentation. Students perform condition assessments and conduct research leading to short writing assignments and a term paper.    Back to top    MSMS-GA 2223 Historic Sites, Cultural Landscapes and the Politics of Preservation Elective. 4 points. This course will examine the cultural politics that influence reuse of historic spaces for museums and other public purposes. Through course readings, site visits and individual archival research, students will explore sites ranging from historic houses and period rooms presented as museum installations to restored villages and communities to dramatic reuse of historic space for cultural tourism. Students will pay particular attention to the social and political contexts in which original use and subsequent reuse took place, and analyze primary documents that illustrate both motivations and strategies for interpretation. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 1 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and the Law Elective. 4 points. Legal issues pervade so many aspects of the world of museums. The law can both constrain and enable the behavior of museum staff, administration, and others who work with these cultural organizations. Therefore, it is difficult to work in, for and with museums without some training in or familiarity with the law. In this course, we will examine how museums are affected by a variety of legal regulations, including cultural heritage legislation, intellectual property issues, such as copyright, trademark and moral rights, first amendment and censorship claims, work-place hazards, contracts, and nonprofit and tax laws, such as valuation, charitable transfers, payments in lieu of taxes and the unrelated business income tax. Readings will consist of case law and secondary sources detailing the most pressing legal issues facing different types of museums, and group discussions will be supplemented by mock case studies and negotiation exercises. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 2 Topics in Museum Studies: Anthropology in and of Museums Elective. 4 points. This course considers \"the museum\" as an object of ethnographic inquiry, examining it as a social institution embedded in a broader field of cultural heritage that is perpetually under negotiation. We reflect on how museum principles of classification, practices of collection and exhibition, uptake of media, technology, and archiving have influenced the ways in which knowledge has been formed, presented, and represented; and interrogate the role of museums as significant social actors in broad anthropological debates on power, materiality, value, representation, culture, nationalism, circulation, aesthetics, science, history, and \"new\" technologies. The museum is never simply a repository of arts, cultures, histories, or scientific knowledges, but also a site of tremendous creativity and a field of complex social relations.    Relying on case studies as a springboard for discussion of broader theoretical interventions, this course is structured according to four overlapping themes. We think about museums as nodes in the traffic in art and culture, a metaphor for the transnational circulation of objects and competing regimes of value illuminating histories of colonialism, power relations, and intercultural production. Secondly, we interrogate the relationships between Indigenous people and museums, including national recognition of diversity, counter-narratives of history and belonging, performances of the other, and the intersections of Indigenous knowledge and various legal frameworks. Throughout the semester, we will think about the strategies and tools through which museums produce understandings of tangible artifacts (photographs, scientific specimens, artworks) and inspire reconsideration of preservation, archives, and memory. Finally, while the social lives of museums are always in flux, we conclude with developments in digital technologies. By the end of the semester, students will have gained both historical and ethnographic perspectives on how museums help us to know and reproduce ourselves and \"others,\" and how these institutions craft, control, and circulate cultural heritage.    Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 3 Topics in Museum Studies: Debates, Challenges and Collaborations in Art Museum Curating Elective. 4 points.   In this seminar we will examine the historical development of the role of the modern art museum curator, as well as practical and ethical challenges. Among the topics to be considered are: museum curating and canon formation, efforts to reactivate permanent collections through re-hanging, working with new or renovated buildings; collaborations with registrars, conservators and other colleagues; ethical aspects of working with artists; and issues related to museum fundraising and the art market. Inter-cultural issues such as the development of international branch museums; Latin American and Non-Western art collecting and exhibiting will be discussed. Current exhibitions in New York area will be used as some of the case studies, and museum visits are required for course assignments. There will be extensive historical and recent readings in the fields of museum studies, art history, history of exhibitions, texts by curators, museum directors, and critics. Although we will refer to exhibitions in the New York area in several lectures, you are encouraged to discuss museums outside the city and the US in your assignments. Note that in some of my class presentation case studies, I draw on my own professional experience and academic areas of specialization: Spanish and Latin American art. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 4 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Political Conflict Elective. 4 points. In contemporary Museum Studies, it is often said that museums are inherently political institutions. But how do politics actually happen in museums? What has \"politics\" meant for key exhibitions and collections and what avenues of political theory emerge from the museum in general? In this seminar, we will move beyond the general to examine how specific political concepts took shape in historic exhibitions and museum practices from the 1930s to the present. As such, our challenge will be twofold. On the one hand, we will consider how political movements have used the museums as an implement for advancing power and influence. On the other hand, we will consider how museum practices have \"taken up\" various kinds of politics: how museum objects and officials have engaged and advocated the agendas and outcomes of political parties, governments, policies, revolutions, and elections. Case studies will include: Degenerate Art (1937), Paris World Exhibition (1937), Rivera's \"Man at the Crossroads\" (1934), The Guggenheim Museum (1959), Yad Vashem (1965), Harlem on my Mind (1969), The Perfect Moment (1990), The Last Act (1994), The Jewish Museum of Bologna (1998), Sensation (1999), The Apartheid Museum (2001), Holocaust Cartoons (2006), among others. Through these case studies, students will examine the museum's role in the public sphere and the process whereby exhibitions contribute to-- or undermined--key aspects of deliberative democracy. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 5 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Community Elective. 4 points. There has been a turn towards community engagement in recent museum practice. Museum programming today includes civic activism, community participation, and even community organizing in its core activities. This trend manifests in all aspects of museum practice, including exhibition, education, research, and collections care. This seminar investigates the theoretical underpinnings of community engagement along with its practical outcomes. It builds an understanding of community programming in the context of critical museum theory. Collaborative student projects include a critique of existing museum programs and the design of a proposed community-based program at a museum.    Back to top    MSMS-GA 3332 Exhibition Planning and Design Elective. 4 points. This course focuses on the planning, development and design of exhibitions, permanent, temporary and traveling. It is a participatory class where students learn basic exhibition design techniques, including spatial layouts and the use of graphics, audio-visual aids, lighting, colors, materials, and fabrication methods. Students gain insight into exhibition planning and development and the roles played by various museum professionals. There are visits to designers to discuss their work and to museums and other venues to analyze exhibition design techniques. Individual student projects provide hands-on experience. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3335 Museums and Contemporary Art Elective. 4 points. This course investigates historical, theoretical, and practical aspects of the collecting and exhibiting of contemporary art in museums. Topics include curatorial strategies for exhibition and collection development, biennialism, the art market, conservation issues, artworks that take the museum as subject, public and relational art, and conflicts of interest that arise for museum staff and trustees. A familiarity with international contemporary art is required. Assignments include two short essays, class presentations, and a final paper. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3915 Research in Museum Studies Elective. 1-4 points. Independent research on a topic determined in consultation with the program director.
