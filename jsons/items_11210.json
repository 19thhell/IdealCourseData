This course will serve as an introduction to the diverse perspectives that are taught in the NYU Postdoctoral Program by exposing students to the key ideas and concepts, the historical development, and the clinical approach of each of the major orientations or schools. Ethical considerations relevant to psychoanalytic practice will be emphasized. ( Ethics   component of the course )    Writing Psychoanalytically (PDPSA.4553)  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch    This course is designed to be taken concomitant with any other course in the Postdoctoral Program or as an independent study project. It serves as an opportunity to write about a particular topic or question either emerging within another course taken at the same time as this course, or as an independent writing project. It is unique to the program as it offers six classes in which candidates are able to compare and contrast their writing over time and with each other.    Psychoanalytic Supervision (PDPSA.4543)  Instructor: Helen Gediman        This course reviews the present state of psychoanalytic thinking on the supervisory process with major emphases on the supervisory process in a climate of theoretical diversity and heterogeneity and the supervisory process as a triadic system with multiple interactions as the focus. Readings and clinical presentations by students are utilized to illustrate the main issues being studied.            THE HISTORY &amp; DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTORS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4580)    As in the humanities, and unlike some sciences, psychoanalysis must be studied historically. Whatever one\u2019s current point of view, a well-educated analyst must have a solid understanding of Freud\u2019s contributions and texts as well as those of other significant contributors. Often the contributions of seminal psychoanalytic writers must also be studied in conjunction with their school of thought. This course teaches students the theory and practice of psychoanalysis through a study of notable individuals\u2019 contributions, developmentally and historically, as well as by studying the historical development of specific schools of thought. In various semesters or in different sections this course will focus on one contributor or tradition.             The Evolution of Freud\u2019s Thought I, 1895-1915   Instructor: Elliot Kronish      The Evolution of Freud\u2019s Thought II, 1915-1937  Instructor: Elliot Kronish  The Evolution of Interpersonal Psychoanalysis: From Ferenczi, Sullivan and Fromm to Contemporary Psychoanalysis   Instructors: Ann D'Ercole &amp; Barbara Suter   Psychoanalytic History and Changes in Technique: The Place of Interpretation in the Therapeutic Process   Instructor:       The Contemporary Kleinians of London  Instructor: Naama Kushnir Barash    Melanie Klein and Wilfred Bion  Instructor: Michael Eigen          Sandor Ferenczi and Relational Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Jay Frankel    British Object Relations Theory: Fairbairn and Guntrip  Instructor:  Neil Skolnick      Winnicott: The Evolution and Impact of His Work   Instructor: Joyce Slochower    Jungian Ways of Working with Images: Interpretative and Experiential Techniques    Instructor: Michael Vannoy Adams  Hans Loewald and the Emergence of Contemporary Freudian Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Seymour Moscovitz     Introduction to the Work of Jacques Lacan  Instructor: Jeanne Wolff-Bernstein  Individuating the Psychoanalytic Experience: Benjamin Wolstein's Contribution to Theory &amp; Practice  Instructor: Tom Jordan Desire's Voice: Agency, Truth, and Free Association  Instructor: Jill Gentile  The Relational Turn in Psychoanalysis: The Work &amp; Legacy of Stephen A. Mitchell  Instructors: Lewis Aron, Anthony Bass, Ken Corbett, Jody Messler Davies, Adrienne Harris       CLINICAL CASE SEMINARS \u2014 THE PSYCHOANALYTIC RELATIONSHIP: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4581)       Case seminars and careful, detailed monitoring of psychoanalytic process over time are among the hallmarks of clinical psychoanalytic education. This course encourages students to present their own clinical work in detail over time working with feedback from other students and with the guidance of faculty. Depending on the semester or section the focus may be on treatment from a particular theoretical slant or on specific aspects of the treatment.    Clinical Seminar in Psychoanalytic Process  Instructor: Philip Bromberg    Clinical Case Seminar--Doing the Work: The Experience of Analyst and Patient  Instructor: Barbra Locker         Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Jessica Benjamin     The Analytic Relationship: Case Seminar and Clinical Theory  Instructor: Anthony Bass    The Therapeutic Object Relationship  Instructor: Mark Grunes                Countertransference: A Clinical Seminar  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch  Working at the \"Intimate Edge\"  Instructor: Darlene Ehrenberg  Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Continuous Case Seminar: Problems in Early Integration and the Holding Environment  Instructor: Aaron Thaler  Clinical Case Seminar: How Different Theoretical Approaches Inform the Analyst's Direct Clinical Experience with Patients  Instructor: Warren Wilner The Art of Psychoanalysis: A Clinical Case Seminar on Working (and Playing) with the Unconscious  Instructor: Danielle Knafo Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Muriel Dimen    CLINICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISORDERS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4582)         The psychotherapist and psychoanalyst must learn to tailor the treatment to the needs of the individual patient. One factor in individualizing treatment is to take into account diagnostic considerations and various dimensions of psychopathology. This course introduces students to current, sophisticated thinking about how psychoanalysis works with various styles of personality and forms of pathology. Each semester or section will focus on a different category or personality style taught from one or more theoretical perspectives.          Narcissistic States and the Therapeutic Process  Instructor: Sheldon Bach    Treatment of Depressive Conditions  Instructor: Martin Nass       Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse  Instructor: Judith Alpert    Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy with the Person with Psychotic Processes  Instructor: Brian Koehler    Neurotic Personality Organization  Instructor: TBA    Treatment of the Difficult Patient  Instructor: Richard Lasky    Treatment of Borderline and Narcissistic Disorders  Instructor: Isaac Tylim    Selected Issues in Trauma Studies  Instructors: Judith Alpert , Robert Prince , Nina Thomas , &amp; Isaac Tylim    Repetitive Painful States  Instructor: Elliot Kronish    Shame and Narcissism: Developmental Issues and Clinical Approaches  Instructor: Mary Libbey     Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Addictive Disorders: Integrating Contemporary Theory and Traditional Treatment Approaches  Instructor: Debra Rothschild    Adult Onset Trauma  Instructor: Ghislaine Boulanger  An Object Relations Theory Approach to Technical Challenges  Instructor: Monica Carsky  When the Body Has a Mind of Its Own: An Interpersonal Approach to Eating Disorders  Instructor: Jean Petrucelli  Ghosts in the Consulting Room: A Seminar on Repetitive (Re)Enactments  Instructor: Margery Kalb  Clinical &amp; Theoretical Issues in the Treatment of Pathological Dissociation &amp; DID   Instructors: Elizabeth Howell &amp; Sheldon Itzkowitz  Treating Forms of Catastrophic Anxiety in Analytic Work  Instructor: Marvin Hurvich  Narcissism in the Interactive Matrix: Contemporary Perspectives on Technique  Instructor: Sarah Schoen   THE STUDY &amp; CLINICAL USE OF DREAMS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4583)        The origins of psychoanalysis go back to Freud\u2019s study of his own and his patients\u2019 dreams and to his first major work, The Interpretation of Dreams . This course introduces students to current theories of dreaming, empirical research on dreaming, and clinical work with dreams. Each semester or section will focus on a specific aspect of dreams, such as methodology for dream interpretation or comparative study of dream theories.           Clinical Seminar on Dreams  Instructor: Mark Blechner    Current Perspectives on Dreaming: Theory, Research and Practice  Instructor: James Fosshage   COMPARATIVE PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4584)    Contemporary psychoanalysis is diverse and pluralistic, some might even say fragmented into various schools and theories. This course examines psychoanalytic theories and clinical practices using a model of \u201ccomparative psychoanalysis.\u201d Theories and practices are examined historically, compared along the lines of theoretical and clinical issues, and compared for their implications in the treatment situation. Readings and course discussions add complexity and depth to the student\u2019s sense of the contributions and limitations of each model for clinical practice.       Comparative Analysis of Major Contemporary Orientations  Instructor: Warren Wilner    Comparative theories of Therapeutic Action  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch    On Termination: Theoretical, Technical and Relational Considerations  Instructor: Jill Salberg  Inter-Orientation Case Seminar  Instructor: Barbara Dusansky  A Clinical Approach to Transforming Enactment  Instructor: Michael Varga   Comparing Models of Intersubjectivity from Different Theoretical Perspectives  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch  Relational Practice: An Integrative Psychoanalytic Perspective   Instructor: Paul Wachtel   Theoretical Pluralism and the Working Clinician  Instructor: Fred Pine   Comparative Models in Psychoanalytic Theory  Instructor: Steven Ellman    Our Bodies, Our Patients' Bodies, the Dance  Instructors: Katie Gentile , Steven Knoblauch , &amp; Sue Shapiro  Transformations of Agency: Theory and Clinical Phenomenology  Instructor: Jill Gentile  Clinical Implications of the Cognitive Neuroscience Revolution  Instructor: Michael Moskowitz  Psychotherapy Integration: CBT &amp; Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Jill Bresler  Mourning as Transformation: the Creative Edge of Traumatic &amp; \"Ordinary Loss\"  Instructor: Donna Bassin       PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY &amp; TECHNIQUE: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4585)      This course focuses on the intricate and complex relationship between theory and clinical technique. How do we understand the psychoanalytic method? What are the technical implications of diverse theories? What is the relationship between theory and technique and when can theory aid or interfere in treatment? Each semester or section will examine a specific theory and its application in depth and detail.            Theory of Psychoanalytic Technique I  Instructor: Andrew Druck   Theory of Psychoanalytic Technique II  Instructor: Andrew Druck  Relational Concepts: An Integrative Seminar  Instructor: Jody Davies  Fundamentals of the Psychoanalytic Situation  Instructor: Lisa Director  Introduction to Relational Models of Psychoanalysis and Their Implications for Treatment  Instructor: Jeremy Safran  Relational Self Psychology: Essential Contributions  Instructor: Carolyn Clement  Relational Self Psychology: Contemporary Trends in Relational Self Psychology: Theories &amp; Clinical Applications  Instructor: James Fosshage  The Analysis of Conflict in Contemporary Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice  Instructor: Stanley Grand  Interaction in Psychoanalysis: Transference, Countertransference, and Enactment  Instructor: Gil Katz   Psyche-Soma and Soma-Psyche: The Foregrounded Body in Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice  Instructor: Sharone Bergner  Hate, Envy, and Destructiveness  Instructor: Sue Grand   Constructivism and the Psychoanalytic Situation  Instructor: Donnel Stern   Subjectivity and Intersubjectivity in Relational Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Bruce Reis  Dialectical Constructivism I  Instructor: Irwin Z.

From this point of view, psychoanalysis itself can be critiqued as constructing and constraining such discourses. In addition, psychoanalysis is viewed as part of the larger mental health system, with all its social welfare and social control functions. But psychoanalysis can also function in service of social critique, as when it offers understandings of socio-economic-political structures that are concealed in the surface of ordinary discourses. These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.                Psychoanalysis and Politics  Instructor: Steven Botticelli  More Than Personal: Political and Spiritual Dimensions of the Therapeutic Relationship  Instructor: Andrew Samuels   Race, Racism and Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren  Psychoanalysis and Buddhism: Phenomenological, Spiritual, and Cultural Issues  Instructor: Sara Weber &amp; William Auerbach  Dissociation and Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Foundations of Intersubjectivity: An Introduction to the Philosophy that Grounds Relational Thinking  Instructor: Jack Foehl Psychoanalysis &amp; Religious Narratives: The Christian Narrative  Instructor: Marie Hoffman  Psychoanalysis &amp; Cultural Studies  Instructors: Steven Botticelli &amp; Katie Gentile  Dissociation &amp; Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Social Identities: Race, Class, Gender &amp; Sexuality  Instructor: Melanie Suchet &amp; Cleonie White  The Politics of Psychoanalysis &amp; the Psychoanalysis of Politics  Instructor: Nancy Hollander        GENDER &amp; SEXUALITY: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4587)       Historically, aspects of psychoanalysis were rooted in 19 th century cultural assumptions about sexuality and gender. Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.                 Autogynephilia, Barebacking, Cisgenderism: Can We Talk (about Gender &amp; Sexuality)?  Instructor: Jack Drescher   Gender and Psychoanalysis: History, Critique, Queering &amp; Complicating (NB: instructor is in the process of updating the readings)  Instructor: Virginia Goldner  Sexuality in Relational Perspective  Instructor: TBA Advanced Seminar on Sexuality in Relational Perspective   Instructor: Muriel Dimen  The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman  Comparative Perspectives on Sexuality: Theoretical &amp; Clinical Perspectives  Instructor: Galit Atlas (Koch)       DEVELOPMENTAL &amp; LIFE SPAN ISSUES: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4588)       The genetic and epigenetic (developmental) points of view have long been important to psychoanalysis. Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.               Developmental Perspectives in Psychoanalysis: Infancy through Latency  Instructor: Neal Vorus   Adolescence in Development &amp; Adult Treatment  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren   The Analytic Process &amp; the Process of Development: Emerging Developmental Perspectives &amp; the Actuality of Analytic Work  Instructor: Susan Warshaw Developmental Issues in the Analytic Setting  Instructor: Adrienne Harris Object Loss in Clinical Practice   Instructor: TBA The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality, and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman   Coupling: An Interpersonal Perspective on Adult Development and Intimacy  Instructor: Mary-Joan Gerson   The Developmental Lens and Adult Analytic Work  Instructor: Katherine Oram   Anxiety, Envy, Shame &amp; the Developmental Process  Instructor: Christopher Bonovitz       INFANCY &amp; PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4589)       The past several decades have seen an explosion of research on infancy, and the findings of infancy research have had a significant impact on psychoanalytic theory and practice. Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.

Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.

Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.

Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity  Bianchi This is the first part of a two-course sequence on the history of materialisms in Western philosophy and literature. The second will be taught by Jacques Lezra in Spring 2014. Each class may be taken independently. In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific historical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the Latin \u2018materia\u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally, wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient texts, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies of nature, Greek atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals, and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including those of Kristeva, Irigaray, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19th century conception of Mutterrecht. Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation.  Topics in Black Literature: Fanon &amp; Glissant as Post Negritude Thinkers  Diawara The idea is to take the 1956 Congress of Black Writers and Artists, organized by Presence Africaine in Paris (at the Sorbonne), as a seminal moment, not only for the theories of decolonization, but also for ways of imagining Black and African modernities beyond Negritude. For the first time at this, writers, writers were proposing alternative ideas--Metissage, creolization and national culture--instead of the all encompassing theory of Negritude and its variances of Africanism. The course will first focus on the significance of this Congress to what we call Black Cultural Studies, today, and then attempt to situate and read the texts of Fanon and Glissant in relation to Senghor and Cesaire.  Special Topics in Theory: Edward Said, Comparative Genealogies, and Intellectual Practice Dopico Ten years after his death, we reflect on the intellectual and political legacies, the critical genealogies, and the web of affiliations and interlocutors that Edward Said inscribed for comparative literature. We consider his works from Beginnings on and engage alongside his texts those of his chief influences and interlocutors, including Vico, Gramsci, Arendt, Auerbach, de Man, Derrida, Foucault, Williams and Hall. We will think about his work, his negotiations with various genealogies and intellectual formations, and his role in redefining disciplinary boundaries, historical disciplines like comparatism and emergent fields like postcolonial studies. We will think about his practices as an academic and public intellectual, consider how Said reflected on genre, medium, vocation, and worldliness, and how the essay served as the paradigmatic heuristic practice for his critical engagements.  Culture and Critique: Transnational America   Garcia This seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic accounts of \u201cAmerica\u201d during different historical junctures and devote special attention to re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. We examine longstanding varieties of comparative cultural studies, including theories of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the planetary. Among our recurrent themes will be the anti-colonial imagination nurtured by transnational intellectual cultures. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, Claude McKay, Sherwood Anderson, Nella Larsen, and Jean Toomer, we consider the implications of recent social theory (Spivak, Laclau, Zizek, among others) for twenty-first century comparative American studies.  Discourse and Society: Third Worldism: Bandung, Afro-Asianness, Non-Alignment, &amp; the Middle East  Halim This course addresses a series of overlapping Third-Worldist internationalist movements starting from Bandung (1955) with a focus on the Middle East. Through theoretical texts, journals of the period, and conference statements, accompanied by some literary texts, we will interrogate the prehistory of postcolonial theory, which is generally dated to the publication in 1978 of Edward W. Said\u2019s Orientalism and ask what political purchase may still attach to the term \u201cThird World,\u201d for example in the Arab Spring. Readings by, among others, Anouar Abdel Malek; Aijaz Ahmad; Samir Amin; Mohamed El-Bisatie; Rachid al-Daif; Arif Dirlik; Frantz Fanon; Amitav Ghosh; Alex LaGuma; Roel Meijer; Kwame Nkrumah; Edward Said; Helmy Sharawy; Richard Wright; and Robert Young.  Literature, History, and Politics: Comparative Internationalisms  Ross Internationalism is a central political and cultural force of the modern era. Yet unlike the vast literature on empire and nationalism, the study of radical internationalism has been comparatively meager. This seminar will study the cultural politics of late 19th century Europe in the wake of the Paris Commune of 1871, paying particular attention to the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, Kropotkin\u2019s political theory, the multifarious writing and activities of William Morris, as well as other figures including Elisee Reclus and Paul Lafargue. Topics to include internationalism, anti-productivism, anarchism.   Contemporary Critical Theories: Freud\u2019s Case Histories  Sanders Psychoanalysis has played a crucial part in the evolution of the critical theories that inform our practice in literary studies. From the efforts of the Frankfurt School to come to terms with the terrifying conjuncture represented by the rise of Fascism in Europe, to the emergence of postcolonial critique in Frantz Fanon and others, to deconstruction, and feminist and queer theory, psychoanalysis has been widely appropriated\u2014often critically, but almost always productively. In this seminar, we shall immerse ourselves in what are the key classical demonstrations of the setting to work of psychoanalysis\u2014namely, Freud\u2019s major case histories: from the Studies on Hysteria, to the cases of Dora, Little Hans, the Rat Man, Senatspr\u00e4sident Schreber, and the Wolf Man. Attention will also be devoted to Freud\u2019s papers on technique. In order to link Freud\u2019s texts to more recent developments in theory and cultural studies, we shall be considering them through the lens of the commentaries devoted to them by Jacques Lacan, as well as important subsequent interventions by Jacqueline Rose, Juliet Mitchell, Nicolas Abraham &amp; Maria Torok, Jacques Derrida, Friedrich Kittler, Avital Ronell, and Eric Santner.
