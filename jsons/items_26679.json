These concerns constitute the core of my teaching at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels, and are the object of much of my research over the past several years.

My latest research focuses on two topics: the historical problem of re-enactment in documentary, docudrama, and art video; and the intersubjective experience of sound and listening in cinema and other public media.

Study Abroad Summer High School Summer in New York City Programs for Visiting Students Open Arts Minors Blog Events Newsletters Videos Admin &amp; Faculty Alumni Contact Us  home &gt; Special Programs        Paris Experimental Production Workshop    Program Overview One of the most captivating cities in Europe, Paris retains its timeless   legacy as an artistic, intellectual, and literary pacesetter. The   Eiffel Tower, symbol of the city, dominates the skyline. North of the   Seine, the Right Bank is home to monumental buildings, grand boulevards,   and major museums, including the Louvre and the Centre Pompidou. The   Left Bank (rive gauche) invokes a Bohemian and intellectual atmosphere   with its university communities, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, jazz clubs, and   chic boutiques. NYU Paris is located in the Latin Quarter, the   thriving historic and intellectual heart of Paris and  students have the opportunity to benefit from the numerous cultural,   artistic, and academic institutions of this celebrated neighborhood. Prerequisite: Tisch Film Majors: Sight &amp; Sound: Film and Sight &amp; Sound: Studio   (or Sight &amp; Sound: Documentary). NYU Non-film majors: Sight and Sound or Fundamentals of Digital Filmmaking Visiting Students: College Level Experience in Film Production  Program Curriculum Students must take the following two courses, for a total of 7 units.  Intermediate Experimental Workshop IFMTV-UT 1049.001 4 units Instructor: Darrell Wilson A production course in which students experiment with non-narrative approaches to content, structure, technique, and style. Themes and orientations include many possibilities, such as music, choreography, visual or audio art, investigations of rhythm, color, shape, and line; poetry, fragmentation and collage, abstraction, performance; and subversion of linear narrative and documentary conventions. (Prospective students who wish to direct films are encouraged to obtain a list of proposal guidelines for each section from the professor before the semester begins.) Note: Films produced for Intermediate Experimental Workshop will not be eligible for awards in the First Run Film Festival if they are longer than 15 minutes, including titles. All films produced in Intermediate Experimental Workshop will be screened if entered in the First Run Festival, but those longer than 15 minutes will not be judged.  Media Mavericks: A Critical Examination of Film and Video IFMTV-UT 1002.001 3 units Instructor: Darrell Wilson This class is a critical examination of experimental film and video with and emphasis on makers in France. There are no criteria for an avant-garde film or video, only the expectation that by watching it a viewer will be introduced to a challenging, refreshingly unfamiliar language that, by the end of the piece, he or she will have begun to speak. This new language many be politically confrontational, aesthetically difficult, lyrical, or rhythmical, but no matter what the form, it will express the particular vision of the artist who produced it. Challenging as this work may be for any audience, a close viewing of these \u201cavant-garde\u201d pieces will expand on your appreciation of their poetry and complexity. Whether you call these films experimental, alternative, independent, personal or poetic, they share very little save for their adventurous desire to reawaken those dormant visual and aural sensibilities that may have been hypnotized into years of sleep by too much commercial, mainstream media.
