Established in 1951, the scholarship has an impressive history ; and scholarship alumni are some of the most powerful public service attorneys at work today. The program covers full tuition, without regard to financial need, for three years of law school for outstanding students who promise to pursue public service. Scholars may also receive loans to cover living expenses, on demonstration of need.   Each year 20 scholars are selected based on three criteria: commitment to public service, academic excellence, and potential for leadership. In addition to full tuition, scholars participate in a program that nurtures future public service leaders by providing unique educational, mentoring, and networking opportunities.   The program defines public service broadly: encompassing policy and legal positions with government (including judicial clerkships), electoral politics, non-profit organizations, academia, social entrepreneurship, community development, and law firms whose primary mission is serving the public interest.   NYU strives to ensure that the Root-Tilden-Kern Scholars are diverse in terms of race, sex, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, geographic origins, and ideology. We consider personal/family history of educational or socio-economic disadvantage. The program believes that diversity is critical to fostering a strong public interest profession.   Within the Root-Tilden-Kern Program, there are several named scholarships focusing on specific issues. Students receiving those scholarships participate in all Root-Tilden-Kern activities and are chosen in the same selection process:       Filomen M. D\u2019Agostino Scholarship for Women or Children       Filomen M. D'Agostino Scholarship in Civil Rights, Civil Liberties, and/or Criminal Justice       Jacobson Public Service Scholarship for Women, Children, and Families       Lindemann Family Public Service Scholarship       Sinsheimer Service Scholarship       For more information please review the program description , how to apply , and the selection process .
