Core course required for all MA candidates; offered Fall semesters.    This course introduces graduate students to the inter- and trans-disciplinary nature of contemporary Irish Studies practice, focusing on issues of historiographic and representational controversy in the interpretation of Irish history and culture. Ireland House faculty and guest lecturers explore current sites of contest and research, including the application in the Irish case of theoretical and critical issues in Humanities and Social Science scholarship. Topics studied on the course include imperialism, colonialism and post-colonialism, modernization, globalization, tourism studies, gender studies, and the cultural construction of memory and identity in Ireland and in Irish communities worldwide.       The Irish Studies Seminar II - An Teanga Bheo: Irish (Gaelic) Language Linguistic Acquisition &amp; Historical/Cultural Context    IRISH-GA 1002. 4 points. Core course required for all MA candidates; offered Spring semesters.    This course is intended to give graduate students for the MA degree in Irish Studies with no prior experience of the language a basic conversational proficiency. It will examine in detail the major historical and cultural subjects surrounding the language, with emphasis on the historical reasons for decline of the language in the modern period since 1500, the nineteenth century and twentieth century attempts at revival, and the contemporary position of the language within Ireland and abroad. This exploration of the language and its historical and cultural context is designed to complement related graduate courses in Irish Studies, specifically those which explore modern literature, modern history and contemporary politics.       Modern Gaelic Literature in English Translation    IRISH-GA 1080. 4 points.    A survey of the impact of translations of Irish language writing on the development of modern Irish literature in English. The course considers selected writers of the first Celtic revival at the end of the 19th century, but concentrates on the language revival movement of the late 19th century, the production of scholarly and popular works in translation (from the scholarly editions of the Early Irish Texts Society to the popular re-tellings of Irish myths by Lady Gregory and WB Yeats), and contemporary translations and adaptations of Irish language writing.  Literature of Modern Ireland I    IRISH-GA 1083. 4 points.    This course conducts a comprehensive survey of the traditions of writing in Ireland from the plantations of the late sixteenth century to the famine of 1846-50. By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency. Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English. It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.       Literature of Modern Ireland II    IRISH-GA 1084. 4 points.    This course surveys Irish writing from the late nineteenth through the late twentieth centuries\u2014a period of both dramatic political and cultural change, and unparalleled literary production and innovation. The semester will be punctuated by (1) major cultural/political developments and controversies: the founding of the Abbey Theatre; the decline of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy; the 1916 Rising; the Troubles in the North (2) dominant literary figures: Yeats, Joyce, Beckett (3) ubiquitous themes: the idea of blood sacrifice as a liberation narrative; the fraught place of the Irish language; the persistent mythic, cultural, and literary trope of woman-as-nation\u2014an image bound up with Ireland\u2019s colonial history. In additions to plays, novels, poems, short stories, and essays, we will read manifestos, pamphlets, reviews, debates in newspapers, and contemporary critical interventions, and we will think about texts in the context of the nation's turbulent history of colonial trauma, the complex path to independence, and the challenges of globalization. Course readings will also include essays that investigate such issues as nationalism, gender, myth, sexuality, religion, and postcolonialism.    Topics in Irish Literature    IRISH-GA 1085. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields. Past examinations have included contemporary Irish fiction and poetry, Irish women writers, and Northern Irish poetry.    Irish Poetry After Yeats    IRISH-GA 1087. 4 points.    This course will read in depth the most challenging poetry written by Irish poets since the ascendancy of W.B. Yeats. We will seek to address the most pressing questions facing poetry criticism in the Irish Studies field: the struggle with Yeats\u2019s commanding example; the relation of poetry to national partition and the civil crisis in Northern Ireland; the confining and liberating aspects of tradition; the use of translation as a means of finding voice; the agency of poetry in forcing change within a conservative cultural climate; the challenge of postmodernism to national literatures, and the arrival of prosperity in Ireland and the consequent need to revise our conceptions of Irish culture. The poets we will read include Austin Clarke, Louis MacNeice, Denis Devlin, John Hewitt, Patrick Kavanagh, Thomas Kinsella, John Montague, Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, Eavan Boland, Derek Mahon, Eilean Ni Chuilleanain, Paul Muldoon, Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, Ciaran Carson, Vona Groarke and Medbh McGuckian.       Music and Cultural Identity in Ireland    IRISH-GA 1315. 4 points.    This course conducts a rigorous survey of the history of music in Ireland and examines critically the role of various musical cultures in the production of national and other forms of identity in Ireland. The course offers student the opportunity to develop a critical vocabulary for discussing music as an agent of social change and social continuity, addressing key concepts in musicological analysis as these are present in the Irish context, including musical modes, regional and national styles, music as an ideological force and its role in politicization, and the absorption and elaboration of musical technologies in their specific social settings.       Irish Music in America 1750 to the Present    IRISH-GA 1319. 4 points.    This course surveys the musical culture of Irish emigrants to North America from 1750 to the present. It seeks to set musical styles in Ireland and America in an informed historical dialogue, thereby opening up explanatory paradigms for Irish diasporic experience and for the role of Irish musics in North American social, cultural, and political life. Students will gain a detailed groundwork for subsequent historical research in folk and popular culture. The course will also be of use to students of comparative music history, the history and theory of popular culture, and the study of memory and folklore.       History of Modern Ireland I: The Making of Modern Ireland, Ireland to c.1800    IRISH-GA 1416. 4 points. Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.    History of Modern Ireland II: Irish History since 1800    IRISH-GA 1417. 4 points.    This two-part survey course seeks to analyze modern Irish history before and after the Act of Union of 1800. The first semester seeks to understand the conditions of possibility for the Union itself: conquest and colonization, resistance and rebellion; the formation of the Protestant Ascendancy and the imperial context of the British state; the discursive development of Irish nationalism; the demographic and societal shifts occasioned by economic development, agricultural change, and emigration; and the Irish contexts of the Enlightenment and the Atlantic revolutions. The second semester examines the impact of the Union and the stages of its dissolution on Irish life, considering the role of Ireland in the British empire; the nature of civil society in Ireland, and the cultural and political dimensions of nationalism and unionism before and after independence; the role of the Irish diaspora on developments in Ireland; and the particular nature of the Irish experience of urbanization, modernization, and globalization.       Debates in Modern Irish History    IRISH-GA 1421. 4 points.    This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.       Ireland in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800    IRISH-GA 1425. 4 points.    The field of early-modern Atlantic Studies is among the most creative lines of inquiry in present-day historical scholarship. And Ireland was a conspicuous presence in the Atlantic World of the 17th and 18th centuries. Irish men and women figured in nearly every aspect of the cultural, economic, political, and religious interplay that shaped this complex transnational society. In a wide-ranging and multi-disciplined approach to the subject, this seminar will explore the significance of Irish involvements in the larger Atlantic World (maritime Europe, West Africa, and the Americas), as well as ways in which Ireland responded to\u2014and was shaped by\u2014such encounters. Students in Ireland in the Atlantic World will have access to archival materials (printed documents and manuscripts) that situate Ireland and Irish people in the mainstream of this dynamic environment.    History and Historiography of the Irish in America IRISH-GA 1427. 4 points. The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.    The Great Famine and the Irish Diaspora    IRISH-GA 1431. 4 points.    This course explores the causes and consequences of the Great Irish Famine of .1845-51 in which about one million people are estimated to have died, and from whose consequences another two million people fled the country between 1845 and 1855. It then analyses the impact of this Diaspora, and of the continuing emigration after 1855, on the receiving countries, particularly the USA, as well as on Ireland itself. This course adopts a consciously and systematically comparative approach towards the history of the Famine and of the Diaspora. A critique of the strengths and weaknesses of comparative methodology in historical studies forms an integral part of the course.  Culture, Empire, and Power: The Irish and Indian Cases in the British Empire IRISH-GA 1435. 4 points. Examines the relative roles of culture and power in imperialism with particular reference to the Irish and Indian cases in the British Empire.       Topics in Irish and Irish-American Studies    IRISH-GA 1441. 4 points.

Fall 2015: Aurality and the Irish Imagination. Instructor: Ivan Goff This course will examine aurality \u2013 the phenomenal and discursive figurations of sound \u2013 in the Irish imagination of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The functions and implications of sound and listeningin literature, film, radio, sound art, and various musical and audio-visual modalities will be considered along with the role of sound technologies in emergent listening practices and compositional paradigms.        Sociology of Change in Ireland    IRISH-GA 1467. 4 points.    The aim of this course is to introduce students on the Irish and Irish American Studies MA to the basic concepts used in sociology to understand and analyze contemporary Irish society. It examines social change and continuity in modern Ireland. The course concentrates on how industrialization and economic development impacted on Irish society in general. By the end of the course, students will acquire a basic understanding of sociological theories of modernization, dependency and class structure, and will be able to apply these theories to the contemporary Irish situation. Students will be expected to attend all lectures and to participate in the weekly discussion section.       Britain and Ireland since 1750    IRISH-GA 2427. 4 points.    Introduces the interpretive and primary literature in modern English history, with emphasis on recent scholarship and methodology in English social and cultural history.

When proficient, they play in a viol ensemble. The FAS Department lends students a viol and bow from its collection. Qualified students may play with The Teares of the Muses, an ensemble affiliated with the NYU Music Department. The group performs on- and off-campus. Requirements to enroll in the course are previous vocal or instrumental training on any instrument - not limited to strings - and good musicianship skills.  Irish in America, 1750 to the Present - MUSIC-GA 1319 Tuesday 3:30 - 6:00 (TBA) Instructor: Daniel Neely This course surveys the musical culture of Irish emigrants to North America from 1750 to the present. It seeks to set musical styles in Ireland and America in an informed historical dialogue, thereby opening up explanatory paradigms for Irish diasporic experience and for the role of Irish music in North American social, cultural, and political life. Students will gain a detailed groundwork for subsequent historical research in folk and popular culture. The course will also be of use to students of comparative music history, the history and theory of popular culture, and the study of memory and folklore.             Techniques of Music Composition - MUSIC-GA 2162 Tuesday 10:30 - 12:30 (Waverly 365) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman (section 001); Louis Karchin (section 002) This semester's topic: \"The Contemporary Operatic Voice: A Spectrum of Issues and Works\" * Please note that each professor will cap enrollment for individual composition lessons at 4 students each. This does not mean that others cannot enroll in the course. Contact the department or instructor(s) in order to get permission to enroll. Special Studies: Czech Music - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 001) Wednesday 3:00-5:00 (Waverly 268) Instructor: Michael Beckerman This seminar both studies and interrogates the idea of Czech music focusing on historical continuities, case studies, micro-histories and the exploration of musical style and meaning. Subjects studied will include 16th and 17th century music in the Czech Lands, Czech language punk and hip hop, romantic nationalism in Bohemia and Moravia, Czechness and folklore under Communism, the question of \"Czechoslovak Music,\" the role of Roma in \"Czech\" culture, and the relationship between gender and form in national music. Czech language not required.  Special Studies: On Mimesis - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 002) Thursday 2:00-4:00 (Waverly 268) Instructor: Jamie Currie Mimesis, broadly conceived, is a central category for thinking about the arts. This seminar will seek to investigate some of the complexities of this notion by means of close study of three operas (Monteverdi's Orfeo , Mozart's Don Giovanni , and Puccini's Gianni Schichi ) alongside a survey of some theoretically and philosophically relevant literature, drawn from (amongst others) Derrida, Lacan, Taussig, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Fanon, Bhaba, Marx, Bersani and Copjec. That is the simple answer to the question: what is this seminar about? A more loaded justification for this course would run something as follows. Over the course of the past quarter of a century, terms such as absolute music, aesthetic autonomy, originality, genius, and the values accompanying them, have been vigorously flushed out of the discursive systems of Anglo-American academic music studies. The detox has been successful. There is no longer any need to boo anyone off stage for speaking uncritically about such things, since nobody now speaks about them at all. As a result, we simply assume the following kinds of things: that the individual is a social construct; that music is born out of its historical contexts; that composers are motivated (knowingly or not) by political ideologies; that performances are expressions of the forces that have engendered us; that there is no outside to history or society or the \"relational\"; and so on and so forth. Once uniqueness has been supposedly unmasked as but another social construct (...or a product of its historical context, or a tool for the work of ideology, or but an unacknowledged expression of the very world it claims to transcend, or...) then we find ourselves caught in a situation where the mimetic (broadly conceived) runs rampant. It is almost impossible for the pervasively cultural turn of so much contemporary academic music studies to avoid talking about how musicking represents aspects of the world, or mimics other musics, or echoes events elsewhere, or mirrors contemporary politics, or reflects issues of gender, or imagines (and thus makes images of) racial communities , or resonates with anxieties concerning the environment, and so on and so forth. Within the sublime mimesis of the worlds in which we now live, if there is one thing, then there is also a trace of it left elsewhere. Indeed, our endless dull documentation of all-and-everything by means of our smart phones and the like is but one example of how the mimetic impulse has penetrated so deep as to be now but a surface physical tick that the body performs unthinkingly in relationship to whatever it is it encounters. This being the case, then \"this\" needs to be thought through: we need to become strategically virtuosic knowing when, where, and how the mimetic can politically function for the right ends, and when it is but an invitation to unproductive incarceration. Of course, scholars in media studies have been thinking and theorizing about such things for a long time. But whilst participants in this seminar will be free to pursue that literature for the purposes of their final presentations and papers (and indeed shall be encouraged to do so should such writings light some productive fires) the focus of the seminar meetings themselves will be to approach this mimetic impulse from a more oblique angle: through case studies of operatic works that are mimetically overloaded (at present, Monteverdi's Orfeo , Mozart's Don Giovanni , and Puccini's Gianni Schichi ), and a body of theoretical and fictional literature that, whilst of import to investigations in media studies, is not necessarily media studies per se. This, in tandem with the more recognizable musicological pursuit of thinking about opera, we will also be reading, amongst other things: selections from Ovid's Metamorphosis , Derrida on Echo and Narcissus, Lacan on the mirror stage, Homi Bhaba on mimicry, Fanon on masks, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, Joan Copjec and Leo Bersani on Marcissism, Benjamin and Adorno on reproduction, Marx on the commodity form, and (over the course of the semester) the whole of Michael Taussig's magnificent Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses.  Special Studies: Islam and Christianity in the Global South - A Musical Geography - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 001) Tuesday 3:00-5:00 (Waverly 268) Instructor: Christine Dang This course explores musical performance in relation to one of the most salient demographic trends of the last century and a half; the explosive growth of Islam and Christianity, most strikingly in regions of the global south - in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Drawing on literature from sociology, anthropology, and ethnomusicology, we probe the varied forms of musical expression that have emerged with the southern migration of Islam and Christianity. We examine the adaptation of canonic practices - such as Islamic recitation and hymns in four-part harmony - as they travel from their storied Middle Eastern and European origins to different geographies and cultures, as they fuse with indigenous sounds and beliefs, and as they inspire new and deeply localized modes of devotion. In musically mapping Islam and Christianity, we contemplate issues such as syncretism, indigeneity, and spiritual hybridity; social constructions of the sacred and profane, and the acoustically fertile spaces in between; the relationship between voice, language, and text in claiming religious authenticity; the sonic demarcation of spiritual centers and peripheries; the role of the slave trade, colonialism, and globalization in the development of Islamic and Christian musical communities; the politics of religious belonging; and the contested place of religious culture in postcolonial and secular regimes. Our leading goal is to bring musical developments within the world's two largest religions into conversation with each other and with broad perspectives on the changing cultural geographies of the global south. This seminar will be useful to students interested in music and spirituality, the anthropology of belief, religious studies, and the cultural dimensions of global south studies. No prior musical background is necessary. Special Studies: New Media Creation Workshop - Gesture, Sound, and Image Interactions - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 002) Monday 3:00-5:00 (Location:TBA) Instructor: Jaime Oliver In this course we will develop interactive artwork that explores the relationships between sound, image, and gesture through the inspection of historical and contemporary works, and relevant subjects in new media theory, cognitive science, and interactive architecture and behavior design. Artwork in this case means music/computer music (interactive/generative systems, musical instrument design, visual music) and sound art practices (sound sculpture, sound installation, sound objects). The course will combine weekly lectures and additional meetings for workshops and critique will be scheduled as necessary. Topics may include the use of video analysis as a sensor/sound analysis and feature extraction/generating and editing visual material from sound signals/topics in physical computing (Pd/RaspberryPi)/intermodal cognition/Pixel, OpenGL, and Shader manipulation/data sonification/alternative/graphic scores. These topics may vary according to the specific needs of student projects. Examples will be provided in Pure Data, Gem, RaspberryPi, (and C/C++ whenever necessary). This course will run in parallel with the implementation of the studio and workshop spaces in the department, which will be complemented by guest workshops. Students are expected to take advantage of these workshops and facilities.  Special Studies: Listening - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 003) *Enrollment capped at 10 Music students Tuesday 9:30-12:15 (721 Broadway, 6th Floor, Room 613) Instructors: Martin Daughtry and Deborah Kapchan The philosophy and social theory of the 20th century engaged the body and its senses in unprecedented ways. And yet the body remained largely silent until the end of the century, when inquiry turned toward two topics: sound and affect. The co-emergence of these literatures is not pure coincidence: sound and affect re-write the body in similar ways. Both highlight ambiguity and fluidity, characteristics of what Steven Connor (2004) calls \"immaterial corporeality.\" Both infiltrate, impact, and exceed the body, revealing it as a permeable zone, a receptive site emplaced within an intersubjective environment that is always already vibrating. Within the rich and growing body of scholarship on sound and affect, we (Deborah and Martin) have each been exploring, in complementary ways, the act of listening. We understand listening to be, minimally: a physiological process,a performative practice, an acoustemological act (i.e. a sound-centered act through which the world is known), a moment of affective capture, and moment of temporary surrender - both to sounds and to the powers that course through them. Our recent explorations of \"literacies of listening\" (Kapchan, 2009) and \"listening acts\" (Kapchan 2015, in press) within Sufi communities, as well as \"(in)audition\" and \"auditory regimes\" within the context of the Iraq war (Daughtry 2012 and in press) have led us to the common set of questions and approaches regarding listening that form the basis for this course. Indeed, listening has taken on a great deal of responsibility of late. In the context of the rise of religiosities, it is cited as the first step in the processes of conversion (Harding 2000:59). It makes the subject vulnerable to an interlocutor, opening a space of inter-subjectivity and empathic religious response (Fryholm 2004: 10-11). Listening renders the self porous to other aesthetic and often spiritual influences (Luhrmann 2012; Taylor 2010). Further, it reforms the acoustic unconscious, creating new religious sensibilities (Hirschkind 2006; Kapchan 2010). Listening also has its role in non-religious world makings. It is foundational in the first awareness of self as sound (Nancy 2007). Through echolocation, listening situates the body within a physical environment and in relation to other sonic agents that populate it. And just as it is forms the self, listening can also deform it or effect its disintegration, sometimes violently (Daughtry in press). Listening, that is, can be instrumentalized to create community, or to dissolve it. Our ears (and skin, and the other corporeal zones that are invigorated by sound) are constant consumers, yet listening challenges the property principle (Kapchan in press). How can we own a vibration, a sound? Together with you we will spend this semester exploring the dynamics, affordances, and limits of listening, focusing for only on theoretical works, but on \"sound knowledge\": the affective transmission that occurs through actual listening acts. To that end, we will begin each class with a structured listening act that performs the knowledge we will then theorize. We will listen in this sense with theories of listening and practices of listening - but we will do our best to blur the distinction between the two. Requirements: Each week will explore a different genre of listening from multiple text- and sense-based perspectives. Students should be willing to engage intellectually and bodily in the seminar. We expect a thoughtful and original paper as well as a sound walk, installation, or other form of documentation of a situated listening practice. Each week, students will write astute commentary that engages with the assigned readings and/or listenings, and post these comments on NYU Classes. Attendance and active participation are mandatory.                                      Sitemap       |       Contact us       |       &copy; New York University, Arts and Science"}]},

Core course required for all MA candidates; offered Fall semesters.    This course introduces graduate students to the inter- and trans-disciplinary nature of contemporary Irish Studies practice, focusing on issues of historiographic and representational controversy in the interpretation of Irish history and culture. Ireland House faculty and guest lecturers explore current sites of contest and research, including the application in the Irish case of theoretical and critical issues in Humanities and Social Science scholarship. Topics studied on the course include imperialism, colonialism and post-colonialism, modernization, globalization, tourism studies, gender studies, and the cultural construction of memory and identity in Ireland and in Irish communities worldwide.       The Irish Studies Seminar II - An Teanga Bheo: Irish (Gaelic) Language Linguistic Acquisition &amp; Historical/Cultural Context    IRISH-GA 1002. 4 points. Core course required for all MA candidates; offered Spring semesters.    This course is intended to give graduate students for the MA degree in Irish Studies with no prior experience of the language a basic conversational proficiency. It will examine in detail the major historical and cultural subjects surrounding the language, with emphasis on the historical reasons for decline of the language in the modern period since 1500, the nineteenth century and twentieth century attempts at revival, and the contemporary position of the language within Ireland and abroad. This exploration of the language and its historical and cultural context is designed to complement related graduate courses in Irish Studies, specifically those which explore modern literature, modern history and contemporary politics.       Modern Gaelic Literature in English Translation    IRISH-GA 1080. 4 points.    A survey of the impact of translations of Irish language writing on the development of modern Irish literature in English. The course considers selected writers of the first Celtic revival at the end of the 19th century, but concentrates on the language revival movement of the late 19th century, the production of scholarly and popular works in translation (from the scholarly editions of the Early Irish Texts Society to the popular re-tellings of Irish myths by Lady Gregory and WB Yeats), and contemporary translations and adaptations of Irish language writing.  Literature of Modern Ireland I    IRISH-GA 1083. 4 points.    This course conducts a comprehensive survey of the traditions of writing in Ireland from the plantations of the late sixteenth century to the famine of 1846-50. By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency. Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English. It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.       Literature of Modern Ireland II    IRISH-GA 1084. 4 points.    This course surveys Irish writing from the late nineteenth through the late twentieth centuries\u2014a period of both dramatic political and cultural change, and unparalleled literary production and innovation. The semester will be punctuated by (1) major cultural/political developments and controversies: the founding of the Abbey Theatre; the decline of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy; the 1916 Rising; the Troubles in the North (2) dominant literary figures: Yeats, Joyce, Beckett (3) ubiquitous themes: the idea of blood sacrifice as a liberation narrative; the fraught place of the Irish language; the persistent mythic, cultural, and literary trope of woman-as-nation\u2014an image bound up with Ireland\u2019s colonial history. In additions to plays, novels, poems, short stories, and essays, we will read manifestos, pamphlets, reviews, debates in newspapers, and contemporary critical interventions, and we will think about texts in the context of the nation's turbulent history of colonial trauma, the complex path to independence, and the challenges of globalization. Course readings will also include essays that investigate such issues as nationalism, gender, myth, sexuality, religion, and postcolonialism.    Topics in Irish Literature    IRISH-GA 1085. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields. Past examinations have included contemporary Irish fiction and poetry, Irish women writers, and Northern Irish poetry.    Irish Poetry After Yeats    IRISH-GA 1087. 4 points.    This course will read in depth the most challenging poetry written by Irish poets since the ascendancy of W.B. Yeats. We will seek to address the most pressing questions facing poetry criticism in the Irish Studies field: the struggle with Yeats\u2019s commanding example; the relation of poetry to national partition and the civil crisis in Northern Ireland; the confining and liberating aspects of tradition; the use of translation as a means of finding voice; the agency of poetry in forcing change within a conservative cultural climate; the challenge of postmodernism to national literatures, and the arrival of prosperity in Ireland and the consequent need to revise our conceptions of Irish culture. The poets we will read include Austin Clarke, Louis MacNeice, Denis Devlin, John Hewitt, Patrick Kavanagh, Thomas Kinsella, John Montague, Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, Eavan Boland, Derek Mahon, Eilean Ni Chuilleanain, Paul Muldoon, Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, Ciaran Carson, Vona Groarke and Medbh McGuckian.       Music and Cultural Identity in Ireland    IRISH-GA 1315. 4 points.    This course conducts a rigorous survey of the history of music in Ireland and examines critically the role of various musical cultures in the production of national and other forms of identity in Ireland. The course offers student the opportunity to develop a critical vocabulary for discussing music as an agent of social change and social continuity, addressing key concepts in musicological analysis as these are present in the Irish context, including musical modes, regional and national styles, music as an ideological force and its role in politicization, and the absorption and elaboration of musical technologies in their specific social settings.       Irish Music in America 1750 to the Present    IRISH-GA 1319. 4 points.    This course surveys the musical culture of Irish emigrants to North America from 1750 to the present. It seeks to set musical styles in Ireland and America in an informed historical dialogue, thereby opening up explanatory paradigms for Irish diasporic experience and for the role of Irish musics in North American social, cultural, and political life. Students will gain a detailed groundwork for subsequent historical research in folk and popular culture. The course will also be of use to students of comparative music history, the history and theory of popular culture, and the study of memory and folklore.       History of Modern Ireland I: The Making of Modern Ireland, Ireland to c.1800    IRISH-GA 1416. 4 points. Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.    History of Modern Ireland II: Irish History since 1800    IRISH-GA 1417. 4 points.    This two-part survey course seeks to analyze modern Irish history before and after the Act of Union of 1800. The first semester seeks to understand the conditions of possibility for the Union itself: conquest and colonization, resistance and rebellion; the formation of the Protestant Ascendancy and the imperial context of the British state; the discursive development of Irish nationalism; the demographic and societal shifts occasioned by economic development, agricultural change, and emigration; and the Irish contexts of the Enlightenment and the Atlantic revolutions. The second semester examines the impact of the Union and the stages of its dissolution on Irish life, considering the role of Ireland in the British empire; the nature of civil society in Ireland, and the cultural and political dimensions of nationalism and unionism before and after independence; the role of the Irish diaspora on developments in Ireland; and the particular nature of the Irish experience of urbanization, modernization, and globalization.       Debates in Modern Irish History    IRISH-GA 1421. 4 points.    This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.       Ireland in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800    IRISH-GA 1425. 4 points.    The field of early-modern Atlantic Studies is among the most creative lines of inquiry in present-day historical scholarship. And Ireland was a conspicuous presence in the Atlantic World of the 17th and 18th centuries. Irish men and women figured in nearly every aspect of the cultural, economic, political, and religious interplay that shaped this complex transnational society. In a wide-ranging and multi-disciplined approach to the subject, this seminar will explore the significance of Irish involvements in the larger Atlantic World (maritime Europe, West Africa, and the Americas), as well as ways in which Ireland responded to\u2014and was shaped by\u2014such encounters. Students in Ireland in the Atlantic World will have access to archival materials (printed documents and manuscripts) that situate Ireland and Irish people in the mainstream of this dynamic environment.    History and Historiography of the Irish in America IRISH-GA 1427. 4 points. The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.    The Great Famine and the Irish Diaspora    IRISH-GA 1431. 4 points.    This course explores the causes and consequences of the Great Irish Famine of .1845-51 in which about one million people are estimated to have died, and from whose consequences another two million people fled the country between 1845 and 1855. It then analyses the impact of this Diaspora, and of the continuing emigration after 1855, on the receiving countries, particularly the USA, as well as on Ireland itself. This course adopts a consciously and systematically comparative approach towards the history of the Famine and of the Diaspora. A critique of the strengths and weaknesses of comparative methodology in historical studies forms an integral part of the course.  Culture, Empire, and Power: The Irish and Indian Cases in the British Empire IRISH-GA 1435. 4 points. Examines the relative roles of culture and power in imperialism with particular reference to the Irish and Indian cases in the British Empire.       Topics in Irish and Irish-American Studies    IRISH-GA 1441. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings by Ireland House faculty and by visiting scholars.    Fall 2015: Aurality and the Irish Imagination. Instructor: Ivan Goff This course will examine aurality \u2013 the phenomenal and discursive figurations of sound \u2013 in the Irish imagination of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The functions and implications of sound and listeningin literature, film, radio, sound art, and various musical and audio-visual modalities will be considered along with the role of sound technologies in emergent listening practices and compositional paradigms.        Sociology of Change in Ireland    IRISH-GA 1467. 4 points.    The aim of this course is to introduce students on the Irish and Irish American Studies MA to the basic concepts used in sociology to understand and analyze contemporary Irish society. It examines social change and continuity in modern Ireland. The course concentrates on how industrialization and economic development impacted on Irish society in general. By the end of the course, students will acquire a basic understanding of sociological theories of modernization, dependency and class structure, and will be able to apply these theories to the contemporary Irish situation. Students will be expected to attend all lectures and to participate in the weekly discussion section.       Britain and Ireland since 1750    IRISH-GA 2427. 4 points.    Introduces the interpretive and primary literature in modern English history, with emphasis on recent scholarship and methodology in English social and cultural history. Readings and discussions of social class structure, the Victorian city and village, labor unions, public education and literacy, criminality, prostitution, and health.       Guided Research    IRISH-GA 1099. 4 points.    The option of pursuing a 4-point Guided Research course is provided to allow students on the MA in Irish and Irish American Studies to prepare their MA thesis in close supervision with their faculty supervisor. Students are required to submit a proposal with description of proposed research, an abstract of the final project, and a schedule of meetings to their supervisor for approval before registration for the semester in which the Guided Research will be conducted. The proposal must be approved by the supervisor and by the Director of the MA. Only 4 points of the 32-point MA may be pursued via Guided Research.

When proficient, they play in a viol ensemble. The FAS Department lends students a viol and bow from its collection. Qualified students may play with The Teares of the Muses, an ensemble affiliated with the NYU Music Department. The group performs on- and off-campus. Requirements to enroll in the course are previous vocal or instrumental training on any instrument - not limited to strings - and good musicianship skills.  Irish in America, 1750 to the Present - MUSIC-GA 1319 Tuesday 3:30 - 6:00 (TBA) Instructor: Daniel Neely This course surveys the musical culture of Irish emigrants to North America from 1750 to the present. It seeks to set musical styles in Ireland and America in an informed historical dialogue, thereby opening up explanatory paradigms for Irish diasporic experience and for the role of Irish music in North American social, cultural, and political life. Students will gain a detailed groundwork for subsequent historical research in folk and popular culture. The course will also be of use to students of comparative music history, the history and theory of popular culture, and the study of memory and folklore.             Techniques of Music Composition - MUSIC-GA 2162 Tuesday 10:30 - 12:30 (Waverly 365) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman (section 001); Louis Karchin (section 002) This semester's topic: \"The Contemporary Operatic Voice: A Spectrum of Issues and Works\" * Please note that each professor will cap enrollment for individual composition lessons at 4 students each. This does not mean that others cannot enroll in the course. Contact the department or instructor(s) in order to get permission to enroll. Special Studies: Czech Music - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 001) Wednesday 3:00-5:00 (Waverly 268) Instructor: Michael Beckerman This seminar both studies and interrogates the idea of Czech music focusing on historical continuities, case studies, micro-histories and the exploration of musical style and meaning. Subjects studied will include 16th and 17th century music in the Czech Lands, Czech language punk and hip hop, romantic nationalism in Bohemia and Moravia, Czechness and folklore under Communism, the question of \"Czechoslovak Music,\" the role of Roma in \"Czech\" culture, and the relationship between gender and form in national music. Czech language not required.  Special Studies: On Mimesis - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 002) Thursday 2:00-4:00 (Waverly 268) Instructor: Jamie Currie Mimesis, broadly conceived, is a central category for thinking about the arts. This seminar will seek to investigate some of the complexities of this notion by means of close study of three operas (Monteverdi's Orfeo , Mozart's Don Giovanni , and Puccini's Gianni Schichi ) alongside a survey of some theoretically and philosophically relevant literature, drawn from (amongst others) Derrida, Lacan, Taussig, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Fanon, Bhaba, Marx, Bersani and Copjec. That is the simple answer to the question: what is this seminar about? A more loaded justification for this course would run something as follows. Over the course of the past quarter of a century, terms such as absolute music, aesthetic autonomy, originality, genius, and the values accompanying them, have been vigorously flushed out of the discursive systems of Anglo-American academic music studies. The detox has been successful. There is no longer any need to boo anyone off stage for speaking uncritically about such things, since nobody now speaks about them at all. As a result, we simply assume the following kinds of things: that the individual is a social construct; that music is born out of its historical contexts; that composers are motivated (knowingly or not) by political ideologies; that performances are expressions of the forces that have engendered us; that there is no outside to history or society or the \"relational\"; and so on and so forth. Once uniqueness has been supposedly unmasked as but another social construct (...or a product of its historical context, or a tool for the work of ideology, or but an unacknowledged expression of the very world it claims to transcend, or...) then we find ourselves caught in a situation where the mimetic (broadly conceived) runs rampant. It is almost impossible for the pervasively cultural turn of so much contemporary academic music studies to avoid talking about how musicking represents aspects of the world, or mimics other musics, or echoes events elsewhere, or mirrors contemporary politics, or reflects issues of gender, or imagines (and thus makes images of) racial communities , or resonates with anxieties concerning the environment, and so on and so forth. Within the sublime mimesis of the worlds in which we now live, if there is one thing, then there is also a trace of it left elsewhere. Indeed, our endless dull documentation of all-and-everything by means of our smart phones and the like is but one example of how the mimetic impulse has penetrated so deep as to be now but a surface physical tick that the body performs unthinkingly in relationship to whatever it is it encounters. This being the case, then \"this\" needs to be thought through: we need to become strategically virtuosic knowing when, where, and how the mimetic can politically function for the right ends, and when it is but an invitation to unproductive incarceration. Of course, scholars in media studies have been thinking and theorizing about such things for a long time. But whilst participants in this seminar will be free to pursue that literature for the purposes of their final presentations and papers (and indeed shall be encouraged to do so should such writings light some productive fires) the focus of the seminar meetings themselves will be to approach this mimetic impulse from a more oblique angle: through case studies of operatic works that are mimetically overloaded (at present, Monteverdi's Orfeo , Mozart's Don Giovanni , and Puccini's Gianni Schichi ), and a body of theoretical and fictional literature that, whilst of import to investigations in media studies, is not necessarily media studies per se. This, in tandem with the more recognizable musicological pursuit of thinking about opera, we will also be reading, amongst other things: selections from Ovid's Metamorphosis , Derrida on Echo and Narcissus, Lacan on the mirror stage, Homi Bhaba on mimicry, Fanon on masks, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, Joan Copjec and Leo Bersani on Marcissism, Benjamin and Adorno on reproduction, Marx on the commodity form, and (over the course of the semester) the whole of Michael Taussig's magnificent Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses.  Special Studies: Islam and Christianity in the Global South - A Musical Geography - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 001) Tuesday 3:00-5:00 (Waverly 268) Instructor: Christine Dang This course explores musical performance in relation to one of the most salient demographic trends of the last century and a half; the explosive growth of Islam and Christianity, most strikingly in regions of the global south - in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Drawing on literature from sociology, anthropology, and ethnomusicology, we probe the varied forms of musical expression that have emerged with the southern migration of Islam and Christianity. We examine the adaptation of canonic practices - such as Islamic recitation and hymns in four-part harmony - as they travel from their storied Middle Eastern and European origins to different geographies and cultures, as they fuse with indigenous sounds and beliefs, and as they inspire new and deeply localized modes of devotion. In musically mapping Islam and Christianity, we contemplate issues such as syncretism, indigeneity, and spiritual hybridity; social constructions of the sacred and profane, and the acoustically fertile spaces in between; the relationship between voice, language, and text in claiming religious authenticity; the sonic demarcation of spiritual centers and peripheries; the role of the slave trade, colonialism, and globalization in the development of Islamic and Christian musical communities; the politics of religious belonging; and the contested place of religious culture in postcolonial and secular regimes. Our leading goal is to bring musical developments within the world's two largest religions into conversation with each other and with broad perspectives on the changing cultural geographies of the global south. This seminar will be useful to students interested in music and spirituality, the anthropology of belief, religious studies, and the cultural dimensions of global south studies. No prior musical background is necessary. Special Studies: New Media Creation Workshop - Gesture, Sound, and Image Interactions - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 002) Monday 3:00-5:00 (Location:TBA) Instructor: Jaime Oliver In this course we will develop interactive artwork that explores the relationships between sound, image, and gesture through the inspection of historical and contemporary works, and relevant subjects in new media theory, cognitive science, and interactive architecture and behavior design. Artwork in this case means music/computer music (interactive/generative systems, musical instrument design, visual music) and sound art practices (sound sculpture, sound installation, sound objects). The course will combine weekly lectures and additional meetings for workshops and critique will be scheduled as necessary. Topics may include the use of video analysis as a sensor/sound analysis and feature extraction/generating and editing visual material from sound signals/topics in physical computing (Pd/RaspberryPi)/intermodal cognition/Pixel, OpenGL, and Shader manipulation/data sonification/alternative/graphic scores. These topics may vary according to the specific needs of student projects. Examples will be provided in Pure Data, Gem, RaspberryPi, (and C/C++ whenever necessary). This course will run in parallel with the implementation of the studio and workshop spaces in the department, which will be complemented by guest workshops. Students are expected to take advantage of these workshops and facilities.  Special Studies: Listening - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 003) *Enrollment capped at 10 Music students Tuesday 9:30-12:15 (721 Broadway, 6th Floor, Room 613) Instructors: Martin Daughtry and Deborah Kapchan The philosophy and social theory of the 20th century engaged the body and its senses in unprecedented ways. And yet the body remained largely silent until the end of the century, when inquiry turned toward two topics: sound and affect. The co-emergence of these literatures is not pure coincidence: sound and affect re-write the body in similar ways. Both highlight ambiguity and fluidity, characteristics of what Steven Connor (2004) calls \"immaterial corporeality.\" Both infiltrate, impact, and exceed the body, revealing it as a permeable zone, a receptive site emplaced within an intersubjective environment that is always already vibrating. Within the rich and growing body of scholarship on sound and affect, we (Deborah and Martin) have each been exploring, in complementary ways, the act of listening. We understand listening to be, minimally: a physiological process,a performative practice, an acoustemological act (i.e. a sound-centered act through which the world is known), a moment of affective capture, and moment of temporary surrender - both to sounds and to the powers that course through them. Our recent explorations of \"literacies of listening\" (Kapchan, 2009) and \"listening acts\" (Kapchan 2015, in press) within Sufi communities, as well as \"(in)audition\" and \"auditory regimes\" within the context of the Iraq war (Daughtry 2012 and in press) have led us to the common set of questions and approaches regarding listening that form the basis for this course. Indeed, listening has taken on a great deal of responsibility of late. In the context of the rise of religiosities, it is cited as the first step in the processes of conversion (Harding 2000:59). It makes the subject vulnerable to an interlocutor, opening a space of inter-subjectivity and empathic religious response (Fryholm 2004: 10-11). Listening renders the self porous to other aesthetic and often spiritual influences (Luhrmann 2012; Taylor 2010). Further, it reforms the acoustic unconscious, creating new religious sensibilities (Hirschkind 2006; Kapchan 2010). Listening also has its role in non-religious world makings. It is foundational in the first awareness of self as sound (Nancy 2007). Through echolocation, listening situates the body within a physical environment and in relation to other sonic agents that populate it. And just as it is forms the self, listening can also deform it or effect its disintegration, sometimes violently (Daughtry in press). Listening, that is, can be instrumentalized to create community, or to dissolve it. Our ears (and skin, and the other corporeal zones that are invigorated by sound) are constant consumers, yet listening challenges the property principle (Kapchan in press). How can we own a vibration, a sound? Together with you we will spend this semester exploring the dynamics, affordances, and limits of listening, focusing for only on theoretical works, but on \"sound knowledge\": the affective transmission that occurs through actual listening acts. To that end, we will begin each class with a structured listening act that performs the knowledge we will then theorize. We will listen in this sense with theories of listening and practices of listening - but we will do our best to blur the distinction between the two. Requirements: Each week will explore a different genre of listening from multiple text- and sense-based perspectives. Students should be willing to engage intellectually and bodily in the seminar. We expect a thoughtful and original paper as well as a sound walk, installation, or other form of documentation of a situated listening practice. Each week, students will write astute commentary that engages with the assigned readings and/or listenings, and post these comments on NYU Classes. Attendance and active participation are mandatory.

Introduces the central  themes, issues, and controversies in American education. What is the  purpose of \u201cschool\u201d? How did schools begin in the United States,  and how have they evolved across time? How do children learn? How are  they different from each other, and why and when should that matter?  How should we teach them? And how should we structure schools and  classrooms to promote learning? We explore these questions in  readings, class discussions, and short essays.        Advanced Courses   European History Lectures      The Early Middle Ages   HIST-UA 111 Identical  to MEDI-UA 111. Offered every other year. Bedos-Rezak. 4 points.   Europe in the early  Middle Ages was created out of a mixture of ingredients: the legacy  of the Roman Empire; the growth and development of Christianity;  invading peoples who settled within the boundaries of the former  Roman Empire; and the clash of competing languages, religions, and  legal systems. This tumultuous time forged a new entity, medieval  Europe, whose development, growing pains, and creative successes this  course examines. Uses the records and artifacts of the period itself  as central elements for investigating the period.      The Crusades   HIST-UA 113 Identical  to MEDI-UA 113. Offered every other year. 4 points.

History of Poland   HIST-UA 178 Offered  every other year. Wolff. 4 points.   Lecture course focusing  on the cultural, political, and religious history of Poland from the  Middle Ages to the present. Begins with the foundation of the Polish  state in the 10th century, discusses the early modern  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and then considers the modern history  of Poland, including the period of the partitions in the 18th  century, the evolution of modern nationalism in the 19th century, and  the experiences of war and communism in the 20th century.      Race, Religion, and  Gender in 20th-Century France   HIST-UA 192 Offered  every year. Chapman. 4 points.   Explores how people in  France grappled with questions of race, religion, and gender during  the 20th century. It begins with the Dreyfus Affair, a national  convulsion over anti-Semitism and a miscarriage of justice that  influenced debates over prejudice in France for decades thereafter.  It then turns to the experiences of women and men during the First  World War, including soldiers and workers recruited from the  colonies. After examining the dynamics of discrimination against  Jews, colonial subjects, and women during World War II, the course  concludes with the French-Algerian war (1954\u201362), when issues of  race, religion, and gender surfaced with explosive force in  metropolitan France, as well as in Algeria.      Liberal Visions of  Empire   HIST-UA 195 Offered  every other year. Sartori. 4 points.   A lecture course  exploring the changing relationship between British liberal thought  and Britain\u2019s expanding empire from the 17th to the 20th centuries.  Liberal conceptions of equality and freedom are generally understood  to be fundamentally anti-imperialistic in impulse, as historically  complicit with imperialist agendas, and as inherently and logically  disposed to imperialist domination. The course attempts to put these  different claims into historical context and to periodize their  applicability.      Women in European  Society Since 1750   HIST-UA 196 Identical  to SCA-UA 716.

Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union. This course traces the evolution of European capitalism   during the twentieth century, from a laissez-faire to a social market   economy. Throughout the semester we will study key themes and turning   points that shaped Europe's economic development: the Great Depression;   the World Wars; alternative ways of organizing an economic life under   fascism and communism; the stagnation of the 1970s; and European   economic integration.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.      Seminar: Topics in  Medieval History   HIST-UA 441   Bedos-Rezak, Griffiths. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.

Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour. We spend the first part of the seminar becoming  acquainted with these developments, while also identifying specific  topics for students to explore through primary-source-based papers of  about 20 pages.      United States History Seminar: Topics in U.S.  History      HIST-UA 413 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.

Course readings will move between regions and through time as we explore themes including environment, geography, economics, politics, and culture. While class discussions will focus on a series of secondary readings, students are encouraged to draw on a wide range of materials, ranging from music, films, and physical objects to political reports and historical monographs, in writing a research paper that will explore some aspect of regional history in the United States.    Seminar: Capital and Labor and the Making of Modern America   HIST-UA 416 Offered  every other year. Montoya. 4 points.   This course has two  purposes. The first is to learn the fundamentals of historical  research. By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.      Seminar: Writing  American History   HIST-UA 417 Offered  every year. Bender. 4 points.

This seminar investigates the historical development of the key ideologies of postwar American politics and their differing engagements with the central historical developments of that time period: the Cold War, civil rights movement, metropolitan development, feminism, environmentalism, and fiscal and monetary policy. It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical  evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between  scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use  of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and  connections between history and storytelling.

Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.

Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis.

The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture.
