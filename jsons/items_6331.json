The undergraduate and graduate programs provide students with an opportunity to develop their craft while working closely with some of the finest poets and novelists writing today. The Creative Writing Program now occupies a lovely townhouse on West 10th Street in the same Greenwich Village neighborhood where so many writers have lived and worked. The Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House allows writers--established and emerging--to share their work in an inspiring setting. We invite you to join a supportive and serious community of writers engaged in an exceptional program of study.

Robin Glazer , MS, BA, Director, The Creative Center, University Settlement       The Creative Center offers programs in visual, performing and literary arts for people living with cancer, other chronic illnesses and across the aging spectrum. As participants struggle through the challenges and turmoil of diagnosis, treatment and survivorship, having a space to engage in creative expression - where positive distraction with a caring individual can reduce stress, alleviate anxiety and fear, decrease boredom and reduce pain- has proven to be highly therapeutic in its own right. Robin Glazer, Director of The Creative Center at University Settlement (TCC) will discuss the program's unique approach. Participants from one of the programs will describe their experiences.          4:30 - 4:55 pm     Closing Remarks          4:55 - 5:00 pm     Evaluation Collection and Continuing Education Credit Dissemination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     REGISTRATION                                                                                                   This event has reached registration capacity.

In conjunction with NYU Silver, Dr. Aiello has continued her research and scholarly trajectory with social work and the arts with children. She has conducted observation of the effects of gardening in an East Harlem school involved with roof top gardening for grammar school children. Dr. Aiello plans to replicate this work in community gardens in the East Village section of Manhattan. She has also observed the effects of learning music on school-age children via the Phil Ramone Orchestra, sponsored by the Salvation Army, and will continue to replicate this study in other children's orchestras. These projects continue her interest in children's narratives of aesthetic development.   In May 2000, Dr. Aiello was the recipient of the New York University Distinguished Teacher Medal. She has worked as a clinician and consultant specializing in child treatment in both residential treatment and out patient treatment for the past 28 years (most recently consultant to the Jewish Board of Family &amp; Children's Services Manhattan North Office). Dr. Aiello is a supervisor for the National Institute for the Psychotherapies Child and Adolescent Analytic Training Program. She has presented widely at international conferences in social work, psychoanalysis, and narrative/narratology.   Dr. Aiello's interests include the intellectual history of psychoanalysis and clinical social work. Her other interests and areas of focus include: attachment theory and contemporary issues of child and adolescent treatment; psychoanalytic theories; the history of psychoanalytic theory and practice; oral history; social theory; feminist theory; and infant research. In 2000-2001, Dr. Aiello participated in a study group on infant research with Dr. Beatrice Beebe. Dr. Aiello is a participating member of the Oral History Seminar at Columbia University. She was recently elected to the National Academy of Social Work Practitioners and Scholars. In 2011, she was elected to The National Academies of Practice in Social Work as a distinguished practitioner and researcher.   Dr. Aiello is currently focused on the construction of narrative in child therapy. Her research project &quot;What the Children Said&quot; is a study of oral histories from child therapists on children's narrative constructions of the events of 9/11. This project is supported by the Jane Bram Fund.   In 2003-04 Dr. Aiello was co-leader with Dr. Brad Lewis of a Humanities Council Colloquium, &quot;Discourses of Identity: Psychoanalysis &amp; Cultural Identifications.&quot; This colloquium was an interdisciplinary seminar utilizing post-Freudian, post-Lacanian, Foucauldian historicist approaches to cultural studies and political theory. Dr. Aiello was the first professor in the Silver School of Social Work to receive a Humanities council grant for this colloquium.   Her recent work includes &quot;What the Children Said:&quot; Children's Narrative Construction of the Events of 9/11 as told to child therapists. This research is being conducted in part at the National Institute for the Psychotherapies Child &amp; Adolescent Comprehensive Training Program. It is funded by the William B. and Jane Eisner Bram Research Fund.   Dr. Aiello has been invited to present a paper on children's narrative constructions of the events of 9/11, based on her ongoing research project at the Oral History Association Conference in Oakland, California (Oct. 24-27, 2007). Most recently, Dr. Aiello authored Narratology, Narrativist Theories, and Children, the fourth publication in the faculty-authored research series, Issues and Action .

The undergraduate and graduate programs provide students with an opportunity to develop their craft while working closely with some of the finest poets and novelists writing today. The Creative Writing Program now occupies a lovely townhouse on West 10th Street in the same Greenwich Village neighborhood where so many writers have lived and worked. The Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House allows writers--established and emerging--to share their work in an inspiring setting. We invite you to join a supportive and serious community of writers engaged in an exceptional program of study.

and other mental health and arts-related fields to explore innovative social work and multidisciplinary responses to today\u2019s practice. By sharing perspectives across disciplines we will create a new climate for interprofessional understanding and collaboration.

Be introduced to the theory and practice of creative arts therapy through a number of modalities;   2. Be introduced to CAT\u2019s evidence based practice implications;   3. Learn how a better understanding of creative arts can be a valuable clinical resource for social work practitioners;   4. Learn how to assess clients for creative arts intervention;   5. Recognize the value of and learn how to facilitate collaboration with creative arts professionals;   6. Differentiate therapeutic exposure to creative arts as different from creative arts therapy; and   7.
