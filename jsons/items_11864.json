The Department of History offers    graduate study in European history from the medieval period through the    twentieth century, with concentrations available in medieval Europe (fall    of Europe to 1453), early modern Europe (1400 to 1789) and modern Europe    (1789 to present). In 1997, the Department has a full-time faculty of    45, 16 of whom are Europeanists.    The History Department offers the following joint Ph.D programs: with    the Institute of French Studies, in French history; with the Skirball    Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, in modern European and Jewish    history; and with the Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies, in Byzantine    and modern Greek history. The department is developing an MA in world    history to begin in Fall 1998. In addition, the History Department has    close ties to various programs and national houses including the Program    in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Program in Women's Studies, Center    for European Studies, and Glucksman Ireland House. A minor field of concentration    in comparative women's history (for the Ph.D.) and a specialization in    women's history (for the MA) indicate an additional area of strength within    the department.    This policy statement describes the Bobst collections relating to European    history -- primarily British, French, German, and Italian -- through the    World War II era. Contemporary Western Europe, Jewish Studies, Eastern    Europe, and the history of the Iberian peninsula are not included in this    statement.    The collection supports teaching and research in additional departments,    programs, and divisions including: French, Germanic Languages and Literatures,    Italian, Liberal Studies, Sociology, Museum Studies, Politics, the Gallatin    School, and the School of Education.                 Scope              Language      The collection consists of materials in English, French, German, Italian, Greek and, to a lesser extent, additional European languages.              Geographical Areas      General emphasis is on the history of western Europe, in particular Great Britain, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy, as well as Greece and the Balkan peninsula.     The collection also includes, at a lower level, materials on the history of present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, and the Scandinavian countries.              Disciplinary Emphases      Historical materials are widely dispersed in the Library of  Congress classification. This statement is based primarily on  evaluation of the relevant D classes (General and Old World  History), with some attention to additional classes, including:  CB (History of Civilization and Culture, CE (Chronology), CT  (Biography), HN (Social History), HD (Economic History), HQ  (Family, Marriage, Woman, Sexual Life), BR (Christianity and  Church History), and BX (Christian denominations).    Generally speaking, the strengths of the collection are in  political, social, intellectual and cultural history. However,  retrospective coverage in these areas is uneven, with some  classes lacking older primary and secondary sources. Current  collecting is based on domestic and foreign approval plans.  Yankee Book Peddler supplies academic and general trade  publications for United States and some British imprints; a  slip-only plan with Blackwell's Oxford provides further British  coverage. Book and slip programs are maintained with  Harrassowitz for German imprints, Touzot for French imprints,  and Casalini for Italian imprints. An ordering plan with Eddie  Ryan for Irish imprints was begun in October 1997. The approval  plans currently in place provide more consistent and stronger  coverage of publishing output than was previously the case.  This is particularly noticeable with the Yankee Book Peddler  plan, which began in late Spring 1996.              Chronological Periods     The collection includes primary and secondary sources for  all periods, from the medieval era through 1945. Retrospective  coverage is generally most extensive for the medieval (ca.  700-1450) and modern (ca. 1789-1945) periods. The early modern  period is of increasing interest in the department; currently,  books on this period are collected on a par with other  periods.                      Types of Materials              Included     Monographs, monographic series, facsimiles, reprints,  atlases, conference proceedings, newspapers, journals,  microforms, book catalogs of major historical collections and  exhibitions, video recordings, and electronic media.              Excluded    Textbooks, manuals, maps, manuscripts, pamphlets,  newsletters, and juvenile and popular materials.    Genealogical materials such as birth and death records are  not collected, with the exception of certain genealogical  reference materials (primarily dictionaries of names) held in  General and Humanities Reference. Immigrant records (passenger  lists, registers of birth) are not collected beyond basic  bibliographies.                     Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection     See Subject &amp; Collecting Levels                 Subject &amp; Collecting Levels    The following discussion by country is based primarily on collections    in the classifications listed above.         Great Britain &amp; Ireland     France     Germany     Italy                Great Britain &amp; Ireland    Collection Description    British history is the best represented among the retrospective materials    for European countries. The collection includes an extensive collection    of primary sources, with largely complete runs of state and legislative    documents, including for the medieval and early modern periods:        Calendar of Close Rolls (1227-1509)     Calendar of Charter Rolls (1226-1516)     Calendar of Patent Rolls (1216-1582)     Calendar of State Papers (1574-1675)     Pipe Rolls Series     Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland during the     Middle Ages       The modern period is represented by the Irish University Press series    (1000 volumes) of selected 19th-century Parliamentary Papers, as well    as the 145-volume House of Commons Sessional Papers of the Eighteenth    Century and additional 18th-century House of Commons collections    in microform. The annual bound sets of 19th- century and 20th-century    sessional papers for the House of Commons are also available in microprint/microfiche.    The collection also includes complete runs of the House of Commons Debates    since 1803 and the House of Commons Journal since 1547. Volumes    of Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939 are available    in print form.    Publications of history societies are also available, including the Camden    Society, Royal Historical Society, and reports of the Historical Manuscripts    Commission detailing holdings of private, non-governmental papers. Local    history series are also well represented, including the Victoria County    histories, and publications of the Chetham (Lancaster/Chester) and Surtees    (Northumbria) societies, Archaeologia Cantiana (Kent) and London and Middlesex    Archaeological Society, among others.    There is a very good selection of secondary sources for all periods and    a strong collection of periodicals.    Microform sets pertinent to British history include:        English Literary Periodicals     Early British Fiction pre-1750     Early British Periodicals     Early English Books I, 1475-1640     Early English Books II, 1641-1700     British Documents on Foreign Affairs. Reports and Papers from     the Foreign Office Confidential Print, Series F: Europe, 1848-1914         The complete run of The Times of London is also available     on microfilm, along with its printed indexes.    Collection Size and Current Collecting Strategies    Current strategy is to maintain the strength of the collection at the    country level through the approval plans. Presently, there is one faculty    member specializing in British/Irish modern history and one teaching medieval    English history. The collection is more than adequate for current teaching/research    needs in the department. I do not check bibliographies or current review    journals in British history.    The presence of Ireland House on campus, with an active program of visiting    scholars and a new Irish Studies minor, has stimulated interest in Irish    historical resources. In 1996-7 we initiated subscriptions to half a dozen    additional Irish historical journals. I also do some firm ordering based    on checking of catalogs and publication lists provided by Kenny's. Short    print runs are an issue for materials published in Ireland; our plan with    Eddie Ryan is intended to address this problem. Purchases are in English    only.                 France     Collection Description     The collection is generally strong although not as extensive  as that for British history. Numerous major collections of  primary sources are available, including,         Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la   France      Chartes et diplomes relatifs a l'histoire de   France (incomplete)      Collection de documents inedits sur l'histoire de   France      Publications de la Societe de l'Histoire de   France      Memoires sur l'histoire de France      Sources d'histoire medievale        Several of these series are in fragile condition and  little-used today, but represent the 19th and early  20th-century foundation of scholarship on the political history  of medieval and early modern France.     Generally, the collection provides less source material for  the political history of the modern period. We have a few years  only of Le Moniteur universel (published 1789-1914) in  Special Collections and the Journal officiel from  1876-1940 (published 1868- ) on microcard. Journal des  debats et des decrets [title varies] is on microfilm from  1789-1814. Archives Parlementaires is available for  the years 1789-1839 in the stacks. Both major sets of   Documents diplomatiques francais for the years  1871-1914 and 1932-1939 are also available in print form.     Local history coverage is somewhat inconsistent and less  strong than that for Great Britain. Retrospective holdings  include older sets of local society publications such as   Revue des Pyrenees and Revue de Gascogne and   Memoires de la Societe de l'Histoire de Paris . Current  collecting is limited to basic periodicals such as Revue du  Nord (1981-present) and Annales du Midi   (1981-present).     There is a good selection of secondary sources for all  periods; current selection emphasizes the medieval and modern  periods. There is a good selection of English-language  periodicals. The selection of French-language periodicals  should be examined for additions.     Microform sets relevant to French history are:         French Political Pamphlets, 1547-1648      French Books before 1601 and 1610-1700      Utopies au Siecle des Lumieres      La condition ouviere, volume II      Fin-de-Siecle Symbolists and Avant-Garde   Periodicals      U.S. State Dept. Central Files -- France: Internal   Affairs and Foreign Affairs, 1945-1954        The complete run of Le Monde (Paris) is available  on microfilm, along with its printed indexes.     Collection Size and Current Collecting Strategies     Beginning in 1996 I have been checking lists of works  published in French Historical Studies and French  History and purchasing, in most cases, those monographs  not received via approval plans. I also monitor le Bulletin  Critique du Livre Francais .     Presently the History Department has a high concentration of  Europeanists whose primary interest is France. The Institute of  French Studies creates an additional source of demand for  materials related to contemporary French society and politics  as well as recent history. For these reasons collecting in  French history requires additional attention with regard to  number of copies and variety of materials selected.                 Germany     Collection Description     The collection focuses to a large degree on the modern  German state from the Kaiserreich forward, with considerable  emphasis on the Third Reich (1933-1945). Fewer materials,  particularly secondary sources, are available on the Holy Roman  Empire; there is reasonably good coverage on Prussia from the  eighteenth century forward. Local history is limited to  selected monographs or monographic sets on individual cities;  there is little at the regional level.     For the medieval period the Monumenta Germaniae  Historica provides a good selection of primary sources,  but the secondary source material is limited. For the twentieth  century, there are numerous secondary sources in German and  English but the selection of primary sources should be  strengthened. Two recently published sets, Hitler: Reden,  Schriften, Anordnungen, 1925-1933 and Die Tagebucher  von Joseph Goebbels have been purchased.     Microform sets relevant to German history are:         German Baroque Literature, the Yale   Collection,      OSS/State Department Intelligence and Research   Reports, Part IV: Germany and its Occupied Territories   during World War II and Part V: Postwar Europe,      The U.S. Occupation of Germany: Educational Reform,   1945-1949.        Collection Size and Current Collecting Strategies     Among books received via approval in both German and  English, the history of twentieth-century Germany predominates.  This emphasis corresponds with teaching in the department. As  interest in the early modern period has increased, we have made  retrospective purchases and I continue to buy selectively in  German; much relevant material is religious history. I purchase  relatively few German-language books for the medieval period. I  do not regularly check bibliographies or review journals in  German history.     Currently, there are three Germanists in the History  Department; two focusing on the late nineteenth and twentieth  centuries, and one working in early modern religious  history.                  Italy     Collection Description    Emphases within the Italian history collection are the  medieval period and the twentieth century, which corresponds to  teaching within the department. A fairly large portion of the  collection is at the local or regional rather than the national  level, particularly for Italian city states of the early modern  period.    Primary sources include Documenti Diplomatici  Italiani , Opera Omnia di Benito Mussolini , and   Cavour Epistalario .    Microform sets relevant to Italian history are:         Italian Books before 1601 and    1601-1700      Archivio biografico Italiano / Italian Biographical   Archive      Italy: Internal Affairs and Foreign Affairs,   1940-1954      Corriere della Sera (Milan) is available in   microfilm from 1876 to the present.        Collection Size and Current Collection Strategies    Currently, Italian national history is not a focus of  teaching/research within the department, although there is  increasing interest in the Mediterranean basin as a whole,  generated in part by the Onassis Center. One faculty member  teachers Medieval/Renaissance Italy and a second modern Italy  in the Mediterranean context. I do not check review journals or  bibliographies in Italian history.                 Women's History     As indicated above, women's history is of particular  interest in History Department; several faculty members  participate in the Women's Studies program, which offers an  undergraduate minor. Because of general interest and demand  generated by other programs on campus, many books in women's  studies should be available in multiple copies. For European  women's history, primary sources of all kinds are highly  desired. Significant microform resources in Bobst which offer  primary sources are:         Gerritsen Collection of Women's History,   1543-1945      Archives of the Fabian Society, part 5 (including   papers and records of the Fabian's Women's Group,   1919-1951      European Women's Periodicals (French   series)      Witchcraft in Europe and America        Women's history is an important area of consideration for  future microform purchases.                  Videotape Collection     The Avery Fisher Center houses a large collection of films  on videotape. The collection includes both documentary and  feature films, including Hollywood and foreign productions.  \"Historical films\" as a genre are purchased, as well as feature  films from all periods which are of interest to students of  European history and culture. Major European film directors are  well-represented in the collection. Selections are made from  various sources, including faculty recommendations and reviews  in American Historical Review , among other  journals.                 Current Collecting Priorities     Collecting efforts presently emphasize the medieval period  and twentieth-century Europe, with regard to chronological  focus, and France and Ireland, with regard to national focus.  Subject specialties emphasized are political, social, cultural,  intellectual and women's history, with less emphasis on  diplomatic, constitutional and legal history.

The collection includes an extensive collection    of primary sources, with largely complete runs of state and legislative    documents, including for the medieval and early modern periods:        Calendar of Close Rolls (1227-1509)     Calendar of Charter Rolls (1226-1516)     Calendar of Patent Rolls (1216-1582)     Calendar of State Papers (1574-1675)     Pipe Rolls Series     Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland during the     Middle Ages       The modern period is represented by the Irish University Press series    (1000 volumes) of selected 19th-century Parliamentary Papers, as well    as the 145-volume House of Commons Sessional Papers of the Eighteenth    Century and additional 18th-century House of Commons collections    in microform. The annual bound sets of 19th- century and 20th-century    sessional papers for the House of Commons are also available in microprint/microfiche.    The collection also includes complete runs of the House of Commons Debates    since 1803 and the House of Commons Journal since 1547. Volumes    of Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939 are available    in print form.    Publications of history societies are also available, including the Camden    Society, Royal Historical Society, and reports of the Historical Manuscripts    Commission detailing holdings of private, non-governmental papers. Local    history series are also well represented, including the Victoria County    histories, and publications of the Chetham (Lancaster/Chester) and Surtees    (Northumbria) societies, Archaeologia Cantiana (Kent) and London and Middlesex    Archaeological Society, among others.    There is a very good selection of secondary sources for all periods and    a strong collection of periodicals.    Microform sets pertinent to British history include:        English Literary Periodicals     Early British Fiction pre-1750     Early British Periodicals     Early English Books I, 1475-1640     Early English Books II, 1641-1700     British Documents on Foreign Affairs. Reports and Papers from     the Foreign Office Confidential Print, Series F: Europe, 1848-1914         The complete run of The Times of London is also available     on microfilm, along with its printed indexes.    Collection Size and Current Collecting Strategies    Current strategy is to maintain the strength of the collection at the    country level through the approval plans. Presently, there is one faculty    member specializing in British/Irish modern history and one teaching medieval    English history. The collection is more than adequate for current teaching/research    needs in the department. I do not check bibliographies or current review    journals in British history.    The presence of Ireland House on campus, with an active program of visiting    scholars and a new Irish Studies minor, has stimulated interest in Irish    historical resources. In 1996-7 we initiated subscriptions to half a dozen    additional Irish historical journals. I also do some firm ordering based    on checking of catalogs and publication lists provided by Kenny's. Short    print runs are an issue for materials published in Ireland; our plan with    Eddie Ryan is intended to address this problem. Purchases are in English    only.                 France     Collection Description     The collection is generally strong although not as extensive  as that for British history. Numerous major collections of  primary sources are available, including,         Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la   France      Chartes et diplomes relatifs a l'histoire de   France (incomplete)      Collection de documents inedits sur l'histoire de   France      Publications de la Societe de l'Histoire de   France      Memoires sur l'histoire de France      Sources d'histoire medievale        Several of these series are in fragile condition and  little-used today, but represent the 19th and early  20th-century foundation of scholarship on the political history  of medieval and early modern France.     Generally, the collection provides less source material for  the political history of the modern period. We have a few years  only of Le Moniteur universel (published 1789-1914) in  Special Collections and the Journal officiel from  1876-1940 (published 1868- ) on microcard. Journal des  debats et des decrets [title varies] is on microfilm from  1789-1814. Archives Parlementaires is available for  the years 1789-1839 in the stacks. Both major sets of   Documents diplomatiques francais for the years  1871-1914 and 1932-1939 are also available in print form.     Local history coverage is somewhat inconsistent and less  strong than that for Great Britain. Retrospective holdings  include older sets of local society publications such as   Revue des Pyrenees and Revue de Gascogne and   Memoires de la Societe de l'Histoire de Paris . Current  collecting is limited to basic periodicals such as Revue du  Nord (1981-present) and Annales du Midi   (1981-present).     There is a good selection of secondary sources for all  periods; current selection emphasizes the medieval and modern  periods. There is a good selection of English-language  periodicals. The selection of French-language periodicals  should be examined for additions.     Microform sets relevant to French history are:         French Political Pamphlets, 1547-1648      French Books before 1601 and 1610-1700      Utopies au Siecle des Lumieres      La condition ouviere, volume II      Fin-de-Siecle Symbolists and Avant-Garde   Periodicals      U.S. State Dept. Central Files -- France: Internal   Affairs and Foreign Affairs, 1945-1954        The complete run of Le Monde (Paris) is available  on microfilm, along with its printed indexes.     Collection Size and Current Collecting Strategies     Beginning in 1996 I have been checking lists of works  published in French Historical Studies and French  History and purchasing, in most cases, those monographs  not received via approval plans. I also monitor le Bulletin  Critique du Livre Francais .     Presently the History Department has a high concentration of  Europeanists whose primary interest is France. The Institute of  French Studies creates an additional source of demand for  materials related to contemporary French society and politics  as well as recent history. For these reasons collecting in  French history requires additional attention with regard to  number of copies and variety of materials selected.                 Germany     Collection Description     The collection focuses to a large degree on the modern  German state from the Kaiserreich forward, with considerable  emphasis on the Third Reich (1933-1945). Fewer materials,  particularly secondary sources, are available on the Holy Roman  Empire; there is reasonably good coverage on Prussia from the  eighteenth century forward. Local history is limited to  selected monographs or monographic sets on individual cities;  there is little at the regional level.     For the medieval period the Monumenta Germaniae  Historica provides a good selection of primary sources,  but the secondary source material is limited. For the twentieth  century, there are numerous secondary sources in German and  English but the selection of primary sources should be  strengthened. Two recently published sets, Hitler: Reden,  Schriften, Anordnungen, 1925-1933 and Die Tagebucher  von Joseph Goebbels have been purchased.     Microform sets relevant to German history are:         German Baroque Literature, the Yale   Collection,      OSS/State Department Intelligence and Research   Reports, Part IV: Germany and its Occupied Territories   during World War II and Part V: Postwar Europe,      The U.S. Occupation of Germany: Educational Reform,   1945-1949.        Collection Size and Current Collecting Strategies     Among books received via approval in both German and  English, the history of twentieth-century Germany predominates.  This emphasis corresponds with teaching in the department. As  interest in the early modern period has increased, we have made  retrospective purchases and I continue to buy selectively in  German; much relevant material is religious history. I purchase  relatively few German-language books for the medieval period. I  do not regularly check bibliographies or review journals in  German history.     Currently, there are three Germanists in the History  Department; two focusing on the late nineteenth and twentieth  centuries, and one working in early modern religious  history.                  Italy     Collection Description    Emphases within the Italian history collection are the  medieval period and the twentieth century, which corresponds to  teaching within the department. A fairly large portion of the  collection is at the local or regional rather than the national  level, particularly for Italian city states of the early modern  period.    Primary sources include Documenti Diplomatici  Italiani , Opera Omnia di Benito Mussolini , and   Cavour Epistalario .    Microform sets relevant to Italian history are:         Italian Books before 1601 and    1601-1700      Archivio biografico Italiano / Italian Biographical   Archive      Italy: Internal Affairs and Foreign Affairs,   1940-1954      Corriere della Sera (Milan) is available in   microfilm from 1876 to the present.        Collection Size and Current Collection Strategies    Currently, Italian national history is not a focus of  teaching/research within the department, although there is  increasing interest in the Mediterranean basin as a whole,  generated in part by the Onassis Center. One faculty member  teachers Medieval/Renaissance Italy and a second modern Italy  in the Mediterranean context. I do not check review journals or  bibliographies in Italian history.                 Women's History     As indicated above, women's history is of particular  interest in History Department; several faculty members  participate in the Women's Studies program, which offers an  undergraduate minor. Because of general interest and demand  generated by other programs on campus, many books in women's  studies should be available in multiple copies. For European  women's history, primary sources of all kinds are highly  desired. Significant microform resources in Bobst which offer  primary sources are:         Gerritsen Collection of Women's History,   1543-1945      Archives of the Fabian Society, part 5 (including   papers and records of the Fabian's Women's Group,   1919-1951      European Women's Periodicals (French   series)      Witchcraft in Europe and America        Women's history is an important area of consideration for  future microform purchases.                  Videotape Collection     The Avery Fisher Center houses a large collection of films  on videotape. The collection includes both documentary and  feature films, including Hollywood and foreign productions.  \"Historical films\" as a genre are purchased, as well as feature  films from all periods which are of interest to students of  European history and culture. Major European film directors are  well-represented in the collection. Selections are made from  various sources, including faculty recommendations and reviews  in American Historical Review , among other  journals.                 Current Collecting Priorities     Collecting efforts presently emphasize the medieval period  and twentieth-century Europe, with regard to chronological  focus, and France and Ireland, with regard to national focus.  Subject specialties emphasized are political, social, cultural,  intellectual and women's history, with less emphasis on  diplomatic, constitutional and legal history.

On the one hand, Iranians struggled to maintain their national independence in the face of growing colonial       pressures. Iran's geopolitical importance made it a central focus of the colonial \"Great Game\" between Russia and Great Britain. Ultimately, in August 1907, the two great powers decided to carve Iran up into spheres of influence;       the agreement sealed Russian supremacy in the north and British supremacy in the south of Iran. At the same time, a struggle was taking place within Iran's borders, as the country was undergoing the Constitutional Revolution       (190511). A dispute over sugar prices finally sparked the first public protests of that revolution. In 1905, the governor of Tehran ordered that some sugar merchants be bastinadoed for refusing to lower their prices. A group of       merchants, tradesmen, and mullahs took sanctuary ( bast ) in a Tehran mosque. Government officials dispersed the group, who then took refuge in a shrine south of Tehran. By January 1906 the Muzaffar al-Din Shah Qajar agreed to       their demands, which included the formation of an 'adalatkhanah (house of justice). Despite his assurances, the Shah did not follow up on his promises, leading to growing discontent and unrest. Finally, there was a       confrontation involving a group of clerics and their students in which a student was killed. This violent encounter led to another bast.        This time, between 12,000 and 14,000 protestors gathered in the British legation, demanding the formation of a majlis,        or parliament. The Shah finally relented, and in August 1906 he issued a decree calling for the formation of a national assembly in Iran. The first majlis        convened in October 1906 and set about the task of writing a constitution. An ailing Muzaffar al-Din Shah decreed the document they produced into law in December 1906, a few days before his death. In October 1907 the new king signed the Supplementary Fundamental Law. Together, the two documents formed the core of the Iranian Constitution.        The course of the Constitutional Revolution would remain rocky for some years to come. Internal differences amongst the revolutionaries, reluctance by the Qajar shahs to relinquish power to the national assembly, and colonial       interests in maintaining control over key aspects of governance severely hampered Iran's first experience of democratization. By the Fall of 1911, matters came to a head, and Russia, with the support of England, gave the majlis       an ultimatum that would essentially nullify Iran's independence. The majlis        refused, and Russian troops entered northern Iran; they brutally killed some of the leading constitutionalists. Other intellectuals and activists fled Iran. Russian troops stormed the majlis.        Under threat of foreign occupation of Iran, the second majlis was dissolved. 1        Though the parliament and the constitution were retained as Iran emerged from its first revolution of the 20th century, the spirit of constitutionalism was dealt a serious blow. The Rise of the Pahlavi Dynasty World War I found Iran in difficult straits. Its economy was shattered, and the country       suffered from a growing power vacuum. In 1921 Reza Khan led a group of soldiers into Tehran. He demanded that the cabinet be dissolved and that the failing Qajar shah appoint him commander of the military. Using the army as his       primary instrument, Reza Khan sought to restore a sense of national unity within Iran's borders. In 1923, the last Qajar shah named Reza Khan as prime minister and then traveled to Europe to seek medical attention, never to return.       The Qajar dynasty, which had ruled Iran since 1785, was deposed in 1925. Shortly thereafter, Reza Khan assumed the position of Shah and established the Pahlavi Dynasty. Throughout the 19th century, the British and the Russians       had vied for concessions to build railroads across Iran, but by the time Reza Shah came to power, no national rail system existed. The cornerstone of Reza Shah's economic reforms was the Trans-Iranian Railroad, linking the Persian       Gulf to the Caspian Sea. The project was financed largely through taxes on sugar and tea; construction was completed in 1938. Reza Shah also initiated reforms in the areas of education and law, which were historically the domain of       the clergy. Compulsory education for all Iranians was decreed, and hundreds of schools were built. In 1934, the University of Tehran was established. As he undertook various development projects, Reza Shah also consolidated his own       power; the people of Iran \"had been denied all share in political and social activities.\" 2 By 1941, with the outbreak of World War II, the Persian Gulf and Iran's vast oil resources became critical for the success of       the British Navy. Iran declared itself neutral, but Reza Shah, who had established strong cultural and technological ties with Germany, was perceived as problematic by the Allies. With Iran under virtual occupation by Allied       forces, he was forced to abdicate his throne, and his young son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was crowned as the new king. Reza Shah would die in exile in 1944. The Reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was twenty-two years old when he assumed his position as the       Shah of Iran. Allied forces occupied much of the country. After the end of World War II, Russia continued to occupy regions of northern Iran. The young Shah visited the United States, meeting with US officials and addressing the       United Nations. Under pressure, the USSR withdrew from Iranian territory. The 1940s saw a resurgence in parliamentarism in Iran. In 1949, Mohammad Mossadeq formed the National Front Party, with the aim of upholding the 1906       Constitution. One of the main goals of the National Front was to nationalize Iran's oil industry; the British continued to control most of Iran's oil revenue through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In 1951, the Shah appointed       Mossadeq as prime minister. Mossadeq followed through on his plans to nationalize the oil industry, and the National Iranian Oil Company was formed. For many Iranians, Mossadeq became a nationalist leader. To some Western leaders       with economic interests in the Middle East, his actions set an unwelcome precedent. In 1952 Mossadeq was named Time magazine's Man of the Year. In 1953 the British MI-6 and the CIA undertook Operation Ajax, which toppled Mossadeq       from power. To many Iranians, Mossadeq became a symbol of yet another moment in history when foreign intervention played a pivotal role in thwarting a democratic movement in Iran. Meanwhile, as Iran emerged from the political       unrest of the 1950s, its economy was in tatters. In 1963, the Shah announced his White Revolution, a program that included land reform, the nationalization of forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to the private sector, a       profit-sharing plan for industrial workers, and the formation of a Literacy Corps to eradicate illiteracy in rural areas. The White Revolution also granted Iranian women the right to vote, increased women's minimum legal marriage       age to 18, and improved women's legal rights in divorce and child custody matters. These reforms were opposed by some of Iran's clergy, in particular Ayatollah Khomeini. Khomeini led the June 5, 1963 uprising, opposing the Shah and       the White Revolution. In the course of this uprising, the authorities quelled resistance among the religious students in a seminary in the city of Qum, and a number of students lost their lives. Khomeini's activities       eventually led to his exile to Iraq in 1964. The oil boom of the 1970s ushered in an influx of petro-dollars, with which the regime spearheaded major development programs. The accelerated rate of development exacerbated unequal       distribution of wealth and led to a variety of social problems in Iran. 3        Discontent with government policies was spreading through various segments of Iranian society. In 1976, leading members of the National Front published an open letter to the Shah, calling on his government to comply fully with the 1906 Constitution. In the Fall of 1977 the Iranian Writers' Association organized a series of poetry readings at the Goethe Institute in Tehran known as \"Dah Shab\" or Ten Nights. Towards the end of the ten nights, the writers and some students took to the streets, demanding an end to censorship. By the winter of 1978, major demonstrations became increasingly common in Iran's major cities.       4 On January 16, 1979, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi left Iran. On February 1, 1979, the Ayatollah Khomeini returned.       Alternative Histories of Modern Iran In the summer of 1883, the first American minister to the Persian court, S.G.W. Benjamin, traveled to Tehran and reported his       impressions to the US Secretary of State:               No city in the east after Canton, Bombay, Calcutta, and Constantinople surpasses it in appearance of vitality. The number of carriages owned by Persian and European gentlemen is nearly 500, all imported. Teheran also        contains a European bakery, a European carriage maker, a European cabinet maker and upholsterer, a corps of foreign instructors of the army, a steam engine at the arsenal, a mint formed on [a] European system, several town        clocks, a hose in the public garden imported from the United States, gas in the grounds surrounding the palace, and public squares besides other evidences of a progressive tendency. 5               In 1975, American feminist Betty Friedan chronicled her first impressions of the city:               My first few days in Tehran were strictly caviar and jet lag and a sense of being strangely at home. Tehran, a Middle Eastern city, seems like an American Western boom townbuildings going up overnight, international banks        next to        a Persian Wimpy stand, and no beggars. 6               Near the end of the 19th century, Benjamin suggested that the prevalence of European objects throughout Tehran held a certain promise of progressive change. Nearly a century later, Friedan described the results of this       promiseTehran had become \"an American Western boom town.\" Both Benjamin and Friedan focused on the material manifestations of progress and equated that progress with things European or American. Neither looked for the       underpinnings of modernity in the Iranian cultural sphere, where modernity was actively constructed, debated, and contested. The truncated narrative of 20th-century Iranian history presented in this essay highlights major events       and political actors. It does not provide a nuanced, textured explanation of how these events were experienced, how political currents were shaped by individuals. The visual arts can offer alternative narratives of Iranian       history. The work on display in Between Word and Image provides important insights into Iranian modernity in the critical decades of the 1960s and '70s.

Curriculum Vitae              Bio   Edward Berenson is a cultural historian of modern Europe. He has mostly worked on nineteenth and twentieth century France, but his recent research is comparative and transnational. His study of imperial heroes focuses on Great Britain as well as France, and his new book on the history of the Statue of Liberty brings the United States into the picture. He is currently at work on a history of modern Europe since 1500 to be published by Oxford University Press. Beyond his work on empire and colonialism, Berenson is interested in the history and meaning of celebrity, fame and charisma, having co-authored and co-edited a book on this subject with Eva Giloi of Rutgers University. Another of Berenson's projects involves the relationship between history and memory, between the social and political uses of the past and the construction of memories in an individual's brain. He is particularly interested in the memorialization of traumatic events in historical museums, monuments, and other public commemorative sites. In addition to serving as professor of history, Berenson is director of NYU's Institute of French Studies and NYU director of the Center for International Research in Humanities and Social Sciences, a collaborative project with France's Centre national de recherche scientifique. He received the American Historical Association's Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award in 1999 and was decorated by French President Jacques Chirac as Chevalier dans l'Ordre de Merit in 2006.

The Department of History offers    graduate study in European history from the medieval period through the    twentieth century, with concentrations available in medieval Europe (fall    of Europe to 1453), early modern Europe (1400 to 1789) and modern Europe    (1789 to present). In 1997, the Department has a full-time faculty of    45, 16 of whom are Europeanists.    The History Department offers the following joint Ph.D programs: with    the Institute of French Studies, in French history; with the Skirball    Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, in modern European and Jewish    history; and with the Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies, in Byzantine    and modern Greek history. The department is developing an MA in world    history to begin in Fall 1998. In addition, the History Department has    close ties to various programs and national houses including the Program    in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Program in Women's Studies, Center    for European Studies, and Glucksman Ireland House. A minor field of concentration    in comparative women's history (for the Ph.D.) and a specialization in    women's history (for the MA) indicate an additional area of strength within    the department.    This policy statement describes the Bobst collections relating to European    history -- primarily British, French, German, and Italian -- through the    World War II era. Contemporary Western Europe, Jewish Studies, Eastern    Europe, and the history of the Iberian peninsula are not included in this    statement.    The collection supports teaching and research in additional departments,    programs, and divisions including: French, Germanic Languages and Literatures,    Italian, Liberal Studies, Sociology, Museum Studies, Politics, the Gallatin    School, and the School of Education.                 Scope              Language      The collection consists of materials in English, French, German, Italian, Greek and, to a lesser extent, additional European languages.              Geographical Areas      General emphasis is on the history of western Europe, in particular Great Britain, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy, as well as Greece and the Balkan peninsula.     The collection also includes, at a lower level, materials on the history of present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, and the Scandinavian countries.              Disciplinary Emphases      Historical materials are widely dispersed in the Library of  Congress classification. This statement is based primarily on  evaluation of the relevant D classes (General and Old World  History), with some attention to additional classes, including:  CB (History of Civilization and Culture, CE (Chronology), CT  (Biography), HN (Social History), HD (Economic History), HQ  (Family, Marriage, Woman, Sexual Life), BR (Christianity and  Church History), and BX (Christian denominations).    Generally speaking, the strengths of the collection are in  political, social, intellectual and cultural history. However,  retrospective coverage in these areas is uneven, with some  classes lacking older primary and secondary sources. Current  collecting is based on domestic and foreign approval plans.  Yankee Book Peddler supplies academic and general trade  publications for United States and some British imprints; a  slip-only plan with Blackwell's Oxford provides further British  coverage. Book and slip programs are maintained with  Harrassowitz for German imprints, Touzot for French imprints,  and Casalini for Italian imprints. An ordering plan with Eddie  Ryan for Irish imprints was begun in October 1997. The approval  plans currently in place provide more consistent and stronger  coverage of publishing output than was previously the case.  This is particularly noticeable with the Yankee Book Peddler  plan, which began in late Spring 1996.              Chronological Periods     The collection includes primary and secondary sources for  all periods, from the medieval era through 1945. Retrospective  coverage is generally most extensive for the medieval (ca.  700-1450) and modern (ca. 1789-1945) periods. The early modern  period is of increasing interest in the department; currently,  books on this period are collected on a par with other  periods.                      Types of Materials              Included     Monographs, monographic series, facsimiles, reprints,  atlases, conference proceedings, newspapers, journals,  microforms, book catalogs of major historical collections and  exhibitions, video recordings, and electronic media.              Excluded    Textbooks, manuals, maps, manuscripts, pamphlets,  newsletters, and juvenile and popular materials.    Genealogical materials such as birth and death records are  not collected, with the exception of certain genealogical  reference materials (primarily dictionaries of names) held in  General and Humanities Reference. Immigrant records (passenger  lists, registers of birth) are not collected beyond basic  bibliographies.                     Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection     See Subject &amp; Collecting Levels                 Subject &amp; Collecting Levels    The following discussion by country is based primarily on collections    in the classifications listed above.         Great Britain &amp; Ireland     France     Germany     Italy                Great Britain &amp; Ireland    Collection Description    British history is the best represented among the retrospective materials    for European countries. The collection includes an extensive collection    of primary sources, with largely complete runs of state and legislative    documents, including for the medieval and early modern periods:        Calendar of Close Rolls (1227-1509)     Calendar of Charter Rolls (1226-1516)     Calendar of Patent Rolls (1216-1582)     Calendar of State Papers (1574-1675)     Pipe Rolls Series     Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland during the     Middle Ages       The modern period is represented by the Irish University Press series    (1000 volumes) of selected 19th-century Parliamentary Papers, as well    as the 145-volume House of Commons Sessional Papers of the Eighteenth    Century and additional 18th-century House of Commons collections    in microform. The annual bound sets of 19th- century and 20th-century    sessional papers for the House of Commons are also available in microprint/microfiche.    The collection also includes complete runs of the House of Commons Debates    since 1803 and the House of Commons Journal since 1547. Volumes    of Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939 are available    in print form.    Publications of history societies are also available, including the Camden    Society, Royal Historical Society, and reports of the Historical Manuscripts    Commission detailing holdings of private, non-governmental papers. Local    history series are also well represented, including the Victoria County    histories, and publications of the Chetham (Lancaster/Chester) and Surtees    (Northumbria) societies, Archaeologia Cantiana (Kent) and London and Middlesex    Archaeological Society, among others.    There is a very good selection of secondary sources for all periods and    a strong collection of periodicals.    Microform sets pertinent to British history include:        English Literary Periodicals     Early British Fiction pre-1750     Early British Periodicals     Early English Books I, 1475-1640     Early English Books II, 1641-1700     British Documents on Foreign Affairs. Reports and Papers from     the Foreign Office Confidential Print, Series F: Europe, 1848-1914         The complete run of The Times of London is also available     on microfilm, along with its printed indexes.    Collection Size and Current Collecting Strategies    Current strategy is to maintain the strength of the collection at the    country level through the approval plans. Presently, there is one faculty    member specializing in British/Irish modern history and one teaching medieval    English history. The collection is more than adequate for current teaching/research    needs in the department. I do not check bibliographies or current review    journals in British history.    The presence of Ireland House on campus, with an active program of visiting    scholars and a new Irish Studies minor, has stimulated interest in Irish    historical resources. In 1996-7 we initiated subscriptions to half a dozen    additional Irish historical journals. I also do some firm ordering based    on checking of catalogs and publication lists provided by Kenny's. Short    print runs are an issue for materials published in Ireland; our plan with    Eddie Ryan is intended to address this problem. Purchases are in English    only.                 France     Collection Description     The collection is generally strong although not as extensive  as that for British history. Numerous major collections of  primary sources are available, including,         Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la   France      Chartes et diplomes relatifs a l'histoire de   France (incomplete)      Collection de documents inedits sur l'histoire de   France      Publications de la Societe de l'Histoire de   France      Memoires sur l'histoire de France      Sources d'histoire medievale        Several of these series are in fragile condition and  little-used today, but represent the 19th and early  20th-century foundation of scholarship on the political history  of medieval and early modern France.     Generally, the collection provides less source material for  the political history of the modern period. We have a few years  only of Le Moniteur universel (published 1789-1914) in  Special Collections and the Journal officiel from  1876-1940 (published 1868- ) on microcard. Journal des  debats et des decrets [title varies] is on microfilm from  1789-1814. Archives Parlementaires is available for  the years 1789-1839 in the stacks. Both major sets of   Documents diplomatiques francais for the years  1871-1914 and 1932-1939 are also available in print form.     Local history coverage is somewhat inconsistent and less  strong than that for Great Britain. Retrospective holdings  include older sets of local society publications such as   Revue des Pyrenees and Revue de Gascogne and   Memoires de la Societe de l'Histoire de Paris . Current  collecting is limited to basic periodicals such as Revue du  Nord (1981-present) and Annales du Midi   (1981-present).     There is a good selection of secondary sources for all  periods; current selection emphasizes the medieval and modern  periods. There is a good selection of English-language  periodicals. The selection of French-language periodicals  should be examined for additions.     Microform sets relevant to French history are:         French Political Pamphlets, 1547-1648      French Books before 1601 and 1610-1700      Utopies au Siecle des Lumieres      La condition ouviere, volume II      Fin-de-Siecle Symbolists and Avant-Garde   Periodicals      U.S. State Dept. Central Files -- France: Internal   Affairs and Foreign Affairs, 1945-1954        The complete run of Le Monde (Paris) is available  on microfilm, along with its printed indexes.     Collection Size and Current Collecting Strategies     Beginning in 1996 I have been checking lists of works  published in French Historical Studies and French  History and purchasing, in most cases, those monographs  not received via approval plans. I also monitor le Bulletin  Critique du Livre Francais .     Presently the History Department has a high concentration of  Europeanists whose primary interest is France. The Institute of  French Studies creates an additional source of demand for  materials related to contemporary French society and politics  as well as recent history. For these reasons collecting in  French history requires additional attention with regard to  number of copies and variety of materials selected.                 Germany     Collection Description     The collection focuses to a large degree on the modern  German state from the Kaiserreich forward, with considerable  emphasis on the Third Reich (1933-1945). Fewer materials,  particularly secondary sources, are available on the Holy Roman  Empire; there is reasonably good coverage on Prussia from the  eighteenth century forward. Local history is limited to  selected monographs or monographic sets on individual cities;  there is little at the regional level.     For the medieval period the Monumenta Germaniae  Historica provides a good selection of primary sources,  but the secondary source material is limited. For the twentieth  century, there are numerous secondary sources in German and  English but the selection of primary sources should be  strengthened. Two recently published sets, Hitler: Reden,  Schriften, Anordnungen, 1925-1933 and Die Tagebucher  von Joseph Goebbels have been purchased.     Microform sets relevant to German history are:         German Baroque Literature, the Yale   Collection,      OSS/State Department Intelligence and Research   Reports, Part IV: Germany and its Occupied Territories   during World War II and Part V: Postwar Europe,      The U.S. Occupation of Germany: Educational Reform,   1945-1949.        Collection Size and Current Collecting Strategies     Among books received via approval in both German and  English, the history of twentieth-century Germany predominates.  This emphasis corresponds with teaching in the department. As  interest in the early modern period has increased, we have made  retrospective purchases and I continue to buy selectively in  German; much relevant material is religious history. I purchase  relatively few German-language books for the medieval period. I  do not regularly check bibliographies or review journals in  German history.     Currently, there are three Germanists in the History  Department; two focusing on the late nineteenth and twentieth  centuries, and one working in early modern religious  history.                  Italy     Collection Description    Emphases within the Italian history collection are the  medieval period and the twentieth century, which corresponds to  teaching within the department. A fairly large portion of the  collection is at the local or regional rather than the national  level, particularly for Italian city states of the early modern  period.    Primary sources include Documenti Diplomatici  Italiani , Opera Omnia di Benito Mussolini , and   Cavour Epistalario .    Microform sets relevant to Italian history are:         Italian Books before 1601 and    1601-1700      Archivio biografico Italiano / Italian Biographical   Archive      Italy: Internal Affairs and Foreign Affairs,   1940-1954      Corriere della Sera (Milan) is available in   microfilm from 1876 to the present.        Collection Size and Current Collection Strategies    Currently, Italian national history is not a focus of  teaching/research within the department, although there is  increasing interest in the Mediterranean basin as a whole,  generated in part by the Onassis Center. One faculty member  teachers Medieval/Renaissance Italy and a second modern Italy  in the Mediterranean context. I do not check review journals or  bibliographies in Italian history.                 Women's History     As indicated above, women's history is of particular  interest in History Department; several faculty members  participate in the Women's Studies program, which offers an  undergraduate minor. Because of general interest and demand  generated by other programs on campus, many books in women's  studies should be available in multiple copies. For European  women's history, primary sources of all kinds are highly  desired. Significant microform resources in Bobst which offer  primary sources are:         Gerritsen Collection of Women's History,   1543-1945      Archives of the Fabian Society, part 5 (including   papers and records of the Fabian's Women's Group,   1919-1951      European Women's Periodicals (French   series)      Witchcraft in Europe and America        Women's history is an important area of consideration for  future microform purchases.                  Videotape Collection     The Avery Fisher Center houses a large collection of films  on videotape. The collection includes both documentary and  feature films, including Hollywood and foreign productions.  \"Historical films\" as a genre are purchased, as well as feature  films from all periods which are of interest to students of  European history and culture. Major European film directors are  well-represented in the collection. Selections are made from  various sources, including faculty recommendations and reviews  in American Historical Review , among other  journals.                 Current Collecting Priorities     Collecting efforts presently emphasize the medieval period  and twentieth-century Europe, with regard to chronological  focus, and France and Ireland, with regard to national focus.  Subject specialties emphasized are political, social, cultural,  intellectual and women's history, with less emphasis on  diplomatic, constitutional and legal history.

On the one hand, Iranians struggled to maintain their national independence in the face of growing colonial       pressures. Iran's geopolitical importance made it a central focus of the colonial \"Great Game\" between Russia and Great Britain. Ultimately, in August 1907, the two great powers decided to carve Iran up into spheres of influence;       the agreement sealed Russian supremacy in the north and British supremacy in the south of Iran. At the same time, a struggle was taking place within Iran's borders, as the country was undergoing the Constitutional Revolution       (190511). A dispute over sugar prices finally sparked the first public protests of that revolution. In 1905, the governor of Tehran ordered that some sugar merchants be bastinadoed for refusing to lower their prices. A group of       merchants, tradesmen, and mullahs took sanctuary ( bast ) in a Tehran mosque. Government officials dispersed the group, who then took refuge in a shrine south of Tehran. By January 1906 the Muzaffar al-Din Shah Qajar agreed to       their demands, which included the formation of an 'adalatkhanah (house of justice). Despite his assurances, the Shah did not follow up on his promises, leading to growing discontent and unrest. Finally, there was a       confrontation involving a group of clerics and their students in which a student was killed. This violent encounter led to another bast.        This time, between 12,000 and 14,000 protestors gathered in the British legation, demanding the formation of a majlis,        or parliament. The Shah finally relented, and in August 1906 he issued a decree calling for the formation of a national assembly in Iran. The first majlis        convened in October 1906 and set about the task of writing a constitution. An ailing Muzaffar al-Din Shah decreed the document they produced into law in December 1906, a few days before his death. In October 1907 the new king signed the Supplementary Fundamental Law. Together, the two documents formed the core of the Iranian Constitution.        The course of the Constitutional Revolution would remain rocky for some years to come. Internal differences amongst the revolutionaries, reluctance by the Qajar shahs to relinquish power to the national assembly, and colonial       interests in maintaining control over key aspects of governance severely hampered Iran's first experience of democratization. By the Fall of 1911, matters came to a head, and Russia, with the support of England, gave the majlis       an ultimatum that would essentially nullify Iran's independence. The majlis        refused, and Russian troops entered northern Iran; they brutally killed some of the leading constitutionalists. Other intellectuals and activists fled Iran. Russian troops stormed the majlis.        Under threat of foreign occupation of Iran, the second majlis was dissolved. 1        Though the parliament and the constitution were retained as Iran emerged from its first revolution of the 20th century, the spirit of constitutionalism was dealt a serious blow. The Rise of the Pahlavi Dynasty World War I found Iran in difficult straits. Its economy was shattered, and the country       suffered from a growing power vacuum. In 1921 Reza Khan led a group of soldiers into Tehran. He demanded that the cabinet be dissolved and that the failing Qajar shah appoint him commander of the military. Using the army as his       primary instrument, Reza Khan sought to restore a sense of national unity within Iran's borders. In 1923, the last Qajar shah named Reza Khan as prime minister and then traveled to Europe to seek medical attention, never to return.       The Qajar dynasty, which had ruled Iran since 1785, was deposed in 1925. Shortly thereafter, Reza Khan assumed the position of Shah and established the Pahlavi Dynasty. Throughout the 19th century, the British and the Russians       had vied for concessions to build railroads across Iran, but by the time Reza Shah came to power, no national rail system existed. The cornerstone of Reza Shah's economic reforms was the Trans-Iranian Railroad, linking the Persian       Gulf to the Caspian Sea. The project was financed largely through taxes on sugar and tea; construction was completed in 1938. Reza Shah also initiated reforms in the areas of education and law, which were historically the domain of       the clergy. Compulsory education for all Iranians was decreed, and hundreds of schools were built. In 1934, the University of Tehran was established. As he undertook various development projects, Reza Shah also consolidated his own       power; the people of Iran \"had been denied all share in political and social activities.\" 2 By 1941, with the outbreak of World War II, the Persian Gulf and Iran's vast oil resources became critical for the success of       the British Navy. Iran declared itself neutral, but Reza Shah, who had established strong cultural and technological ties with Germany, was perceived as problematic by the Allies. With Iran under virtual occupation by Allied       forces, he was forced to abdicate his throne, and his young son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was crowned as the new king. Reza Shah would die in exile in 1944. The Reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was twenty-two years old when he assumed his position as the       Shah of Iran. Allied forces occupied much of the country. After the end of World War II, Russia continued to occupy regions of northern Iran. The young Shah visited the United States, meeting with US officials and addressing the       United Nations. Under pressure, the USSR withdrew from Iranian territory. The 1940s saw a resurgence in parliamentarism in Iran. In 1949, Mohammad Mossadeq formed the National Front Party, with the aim of upholding the 1906       Constitution. One of the main goals of the National Front was to nationalize Iran's oil industry; the British continued to control most of Iran's oil revenue through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In 1951, the Shah appointed       Mossadeq as prime minister. Mossadeq followed through on his plans to nationalize the oil industry, and the National Iranian Oil Company was formed. For many Iranians, Mossadeq became a nationalist leader. To some Western leaders       with economic interests in the Middle East, his actions set an unwelcome precedent. In 1952 Mossadeq was named Time magazine's Man of the Year. In 1953 the British MI-6 and the CIA undertook Operation Ajax, which toppled Mossadeq       from power. To many Iranians, Mossadeq became a symbol of yet another moment in history when foreign intervention played a pivotal role in thwarting a democratic movement in Iran. Meanwhile, as Iran emerged from the political       unrest of the 1950s, its economy was in tatters. In 1963, the Shah announced his White Revolution, a program that included land reform, the nationalization of forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to the private sector, a       profit-sharing plan for industrial workers, and the formation of a Literacy Corps to eradicate illiteracy in rural areas. The White Revolution also granted Iranian women the right to vote, increased women's minimum legal marriage       age to 18, and improved women's legal rights in divorce and child custody matters. These reforms were opposed by some of Iran's clergy, in particular Ayatollah Khomeini. Khomeini led the June 5, 1963 uprising, opposing the Shah and       the White Revolution. In the course of this uprising, the authorities quelled resistance among the religious students in a seminary in the city of Qum, and a number of students lost their lives. Khomeini's activities       eventually led to his exile to Iraq in 1964. The oil boom of the 1970s ushered in an influx of petro-dollars, with which the regime spearheaded major development programs. The accelerated rate of development exacerbated unequal       distribution of wealth and led to a variety of social problems in Iran. 3        Discontent with government policies was spreading through various segments of Iranian society. In 1976, leading members of the National Front published an open letter to the Shah, calling on his government to comply fully with the 1906 Constitution. In the Fall of 1977 the Iranian Writers' Association organized a series of poetry readings at the Goethe Institute in Tehran known as \"Dah Shab\" or Ten Nights. Towards the end of the ten nights, the writers and some students took to the streets, demanding an end to censorship. By the winter of 1978, major demonstrations became increasingly common in Iran's major cities.       4 On January 16, 1979, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi left Iran. On February 1, 1979, the Ayatollah Khomeini returned.       Alternative Histories of Modern Iran In the summer of 1883, the first American minister to the Persian court, S.G.W. Benjamin, traveled to Tehran and reported his       impressions to the US Secretary of State:               No city in the east after Canton, Bombay, Calcutta, and Constantinople surpasses it in appearance of vitality. The number of carriages owned by Persian and European gentlemen is nearly 500, all imported. Teheran also        contains a European bakery, a European carriage maker, a European cabinet maker and upholsterer, a corps of foreign instructors of the army, a steam engine at the arsenal, a mint formed on [a] European system, several town        clocks, a hose in the public garden imported from the United States, gas in the grounds surrounding the palace, and public squares besides other evidences of a progressive tendency. 5               In 1975, American feminist Betty Friedan chronicled her first impressions of the city:               My first few days in Tehran were strictly caviar and jet lag and a sense of being strangely at home. Tehran, a Middle Eastern city, seems like an American Western boom townbuildings going up overnight, international banks        next to        a Persian Wimpy stand, and no beggars. 6               Near the end of the 19th century, Benjamin suggested that the prevalence of European objects throughout Tehran held a certain promise of progressive change. Nearly a century later, Friedan described the results of this       promiseTehran had become \"an American Western boom town.\" Both Benjamin and Friedan focused on the material manifestations of progress and equated that progress with things European or American. Neither looked for the       underpinnings of modernity in the Iranian cultural sphere, where modernity was actively constructed, debated, and contested. The truncated narrative of 20th-century Iranian history presented in this essay highlights major events       and political actors. It does not provide a nuanced, textured explanation of how these events were experienced, how political currents were shaped by individuals. The visual arts can offer alternative narratives of Iranian       history. The work on display in Between Word and Image provides important insights into Iranian modernity in the critical decades of the 1960s and '70s.

Curriculum Vitae              Bio   Edward Berenson is a cultural historian of modern Europe. He has mostly worked on nineteenth and twentieth century France, but his recent research is comparative and transnational. His study of imperial heroes focuses on Great Britain as well as France, and his new book on the history of the Statue of Liberty brings the United States into the picture. He is currently at work on a history of modern Europe since 1500 to be published by Oxford University Press. Beyond his work on empire and colonialism, Berenson is interested in the history and meaning of celebrity, fame and charisma, having co-authored and co-edited a book on this subject with Eva Giloi of Rutgers University. Another of Berenson's projects involves the relationship between history and memory, between the social and political uses of the past and the construction of memories in an individual's brain. He is particularly interested in the memorialization of traumatic events in historical museums, monuments, and other public commemorative sites. In addition to serving as professor of history, Berenson is director of NYU's Institute of French Studies and NYU director of the Center for International Research in Humanities and Social Sciences, a collaborative project with France's Centre national de recherche scientifique. He received the American Historical Association's Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award in 1999 and was decorated by French President Jacques Chirac as Chevalier dans l'Ordre de Merit in 2006.
