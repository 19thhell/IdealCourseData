In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts. Sample syllabus.

From a study of selected commissions by the Pollaiuolo brothers, Andrea del Verrochio, Leonardo, Perugino, Raphael, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Michelangelo, we go on to investigate new pictorial modes emerging after 1510 in Andrea del Sarto, Pontormo, Rosso, Parmigianino, Giulio Romano, and other members of Raphael's school; we consider their younger contemporaries and successors, including Bronzino and Vasari. The course emphasizes the patronage, symbolic tasks, and functions of Renaissance painting and critically examines historical concepts such as high Renaissance, mannerism, and maniera.

Italian Gardens have been a reference point for garden design from antiquity to the present day. The Roman Empire, which spread from North Africa to the English Isles, divulged a pattern of housing, centered upon the garden, across the Mediterranean and beyond. The Roman archetype of peristyle gardens was preserved in the Middle Ages, when religious orders cultivated gardens for spiritual and medicinal purposes within monastic enclosures, and in the Renaissance, when the grand tradition of the Villa Garden was revived. During their rule over Florence, the Medici family built a chain of lavish Villas around the city. The Villas, supported by their agricultural fields, held refined gardens devoted to the Arts, made for philosophical debate, poetry, sculpture, music and theatre, and for medical and botanical research. In the sixteenth century, grandiose gardens were made by enlightened patrons in other Italian courts, including Rome. Florence and its surrounding form the ideal setting to discover the forms and culture of gardens through time, and the Neo-Renaissance gardens of Villa La Pietra give students a chance to study plants and their ecology close up. Field trips will introduce us to some of the great gardens of other Italian regions.   This class raises the issue of whether features of Italian formal gardens can can be exported to other countries, in which way they are site-specific and inimitable, or if the formal language of historical gardens is still relevant for contemporary gardens. We will consider examples of Italianate gardens overseas, with 19th and 20th century examples from the UK and USA, and examine their qualities - or failures. As an introduction to contemporary garden design, Japanese historical gardens will be mentioned as an example of alternative formal tradition. A definition of formal and informal garden features will provide an additional tool for the analysis of contemporary garden styles. A close look at the two most recent editions of the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in London, in which international garden designers quote - or challenge - historical precedents, will enliven the debate on what constitutes an Italian garden.

In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts. Sample syllabus.

From a study of selected commissions by the Pollaiuolo brothers, Andrea del Verrochio, Leonardo, Perugino, Raphael, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Michelangelo, we go on to investigate new pictorial modes emerging after 1510 in Andrea del Sarto, Pontormo, Rosso, Parmigianino, Giulio Romano, and other members of Raphael's school; we consider their younger contemporaries and successors, including Bronzino and Vasari. The course emphasizes the patronage, symbolic tasks, and functions of Renaissance painting and critically examines historical concepts such as high Renaissance, mannerism, and maniera.

Italian Gardens have been a reference point for garden design from antiquity to the present day. The Roman Empire, which spread from North Africa to the English Isles, divulged a pattern of housing, centered upon the garden, across the Mediterranean and beyond. The Roman archetype of peristyle gardens was preserved in the Middle Ages, when religious orders cultivated gardens for spiritual and medicinal purposes within monastic enclosures, and in the Renaissance, when the grand tradition of the Villa Garden was revived. During their rule over Florence, the Medici family built a chain of lavish Villas around the city. The Villas, supported by their agricultural fields, held refined gardens devoted to the Arts, made for philosophical debate, poetry, sculpture, music and theatre, and for medical and botanical research. In the sixteenth century, grandiose gardens were made by enlightened patrons in other Italian courts, including Rome. Florence and its surrounding form the ideal setting to discover the forms and culture of gardens through time, and the Neo-Renaissance gardens of Villa La Pietra give students a chance to study plants and their ecology close up. Field trips will introduce us to some of the great gardens of other Italian regions.   This class raises the issue of whether features of Italian formal gardens can can be exported to other countries, in which way they are site-specific and inimitable, or if the formal language of historical gardens is still relevant for contemporary gardens. We will consider examples of Italianate gardens overseas, with 19th and 20th century examples from the UK and USA, and examine their qualities - or failures. As an introduction to contemporary garden design, Japanese historical gardens will be mentioned as an example of alternative formal tradition. A definition of formal and informal garden features will provide an additional tool for the analysis of contemporary garden styles. A close look at the two most recent editions of the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in London, in which international garden designers quote - or challenge - historical precedents, will enliven the debate on what constitutes an Italian garden.

Innovative, site-specific offerings in art history, history, literature and cinema are featured alongside a vibrant curriculum in sociology, politics and economics. These courses not only take advantage of the extraordinary cultural resources provided by the city of Florence, and its strategic position within Italy and Europe, but also of a unique array of co-curricular lectures and activities that make the Florence campus a dynamic center for scholarly exchange and global policy discussions.   What can study abroad in Florence mean to students? An encounter with the city of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio; direct examination of world-famous masterpieces of art in the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the Renaissance; to consider contemporary social issues at a campus where encounters for students with major European and American protagonists of world social and economic policy are a regular occurrence.   Throughout the year, students at NYU Florence benefit from the opportunity to participate directly in the high-level political, social and cultural policy dialogues organized on our campus. In previous years, we have hosted both Republican and Democrat presidential campaign managers, had a three-way dialogue with leading local Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders, and held a student-organized contemporary poetry slam. Through La Pietra Dialogues, interested students also have the opportunity to participate directly in the organization of the events that bring these outstanding figures to NYU Florence.   NYU Florence provides the atmosphere of a small college campus while studying abroad. An extremely low student to faculty ratio ensures small class size; many courses are organized partly or entirely as seminars. Our 57-acre estate, with olive groves and gardens, has five villas that provide a home to NYU Florence. These include Villa La Pietra with its house museum, and formal gardens. Students enjoy the opportunity to &quot;live&quot; Villa La Pietra during: visits to the collection; poetry readings, concerts, performances and lectures that take place inside or in the gardens of the villa               Learn     Courses   Special Programs   Freshman Program   Facilities   Faculty   Community Service                 Live     Housing &amp; Meals   Getting Around   Cost &amp; Budgeting   Language   Culture &amp; Customs   Safety   Health &amp; Wellness     Staff                 Explore     Restaurants   Nightlife   Things to do   Local Travel   Regional Travel   Shopping                                                                       Info for Parents                                                                                                Info for External Advisers                                                                                                Visit Other NYU Global Centers                                                      La Pietra Dialogues LPD convenes some of the world\u2019s foremost scholars, policy makers, practitioners, business leaders, public intellectuals and artists whose ideas and work have made a significant cultural or intellectual contribution to global society and the revival of the spirit of humanism for which Florence is known.

LPD fosters the creation of partnerships across disciplines, cultures and institutions, as an established center in the heart of Europe attached to an American university with branches throughout the world, and contributes to the emerging global civic discourse that is at the heart of NYU\u2019s mission as a global network university.

In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts. Sample syllabus.

From a study of selected commissions by the Pollaiuolo brothers, Andrea del Verrochio, Leonardo, Perugino, Raphael, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Michelangelo, we go on to investigate new pictorial modes emerging after 1510 in Andrea del Sarto, Pontormo, Rosso, Parmigianino, Giulio Romano, and other members of Raphael's school; we consider their younger contemporaries and successors, including Bronzino and Vasari. The course emphasizes the patronage, symbolic tasks, and functions of Renaissance painting and critically examines historical concepts such as high Renaissance, mannerism, and maniera.

Italian Gardens have been a reference point for garden design from antiquity to the present day. The Roman Empire, which spread from North Africa to the English Isles, divulged a pattern of housing, centered upon the garden, across the Mediterranean and beyond. The Roman archetype of peristyle gardens was preserved in the Middle Ages, when religious orders cultivated gardens for spiritual and medicinal purposes within monastic enclosures, and in the Renaissance, when the grand tradition of the Villa Garden was revived. During their rule over Florence, the Medici family built a chain of lavish Villas around the city. The Villas, supported by their agricultural fields, held refined gardens devoted to the Arts, made for philosophical debate, poetry, sculpture, music and theatre, and for medical and botanical research. In the sixteenth century, grandiose gardens were made by enlightened patrons in other Italian courts, including Rome. Florence and its surrounding form the ideal setting to discover the forms and culture of gardens through time, and the Neo-Renaissance gardens of Villa La Pietra give students a chance to study plants and their ecology close up. Field trips will introduce us to some of the great gardens of other Italian regions.   This class raises the issue of whether features of Italian formal gardens can can be exported to other countries, in which way they are site-specific and inimitable, or if the formal language of historical gardens is still relevant for contemporary gardens. We will consider examples of Italianate gardens overseas, with 19th and 20th century examples from the UK and USA, and examine their qualities - or failures. As an introduction to contemporary garden design, Japanese historical gardens will be mentioned as an example of alternative formal tradition. A definition of formal and informal garden features will provide an additional tool for the analysis of contemporary garden styles. A close look at the two most recent editions of the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in London, in which international garden designers quote - or challenge - historical precedents, will enliven the debate on what constitutes an Italian garden.

Innovative, site-specific offerings in art history, history, literature and cinema are featured alongside a vibrant curriculum in sociology, politics and economics. These courses not only take advantage of the extraordinary cultural resources provided by the city of Florence, and its strategic position within Italy and Europe, but also of a unique array of co-curricular lectures and activities that make the Florence campus a dynamic center for scholarly exchange and global policy discussions.   What can study abroad in Florence mean to students? An encounter with the city of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio; direct examination of world-famous masterpieces of art in the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the Renaissance; to consider contemporary social issues at a campus where encounters for students with major European and American protagonists of world social and economic policy are a regular occurrence.   Throughout the year, students at NYU Florence benefit from the opportunity to participate directly in the high-level political, social and cultural policy dialogues organized on our campus. In previous years, we have hosted both Republican and Democrat presidential campaign managers, had a three-way dialogue with leading local Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders, and held a student-organized contemporary poetry slam. Through La Pietra Dialogues, interested students also have the opportunity to participate directly in the organization of the events that bring these outstanding figures to NYU Florence.   NYU Florence provides the atmosphere of a small college campus while studying abroad. An extremely low student to faculty ratio ensures small class size; many courses are organized partly or entirely as seminars. Our 57-acre estate, with olive groves and gardens, has five villas that provide a home to NYU Florence. These include Villa La Pietra with its house museum, and formal gardens. Students enjoy the opportunity to &quot;live&quot; Villa La Pietra during: visits to the collection; poetry readings, concerts, performances and lectures that take place inside or in the gardens of the villa               Learn     Courses   Special Programs   Freshman Program   Facilities   Faculty   Community Service                 Live     Housing &amp; Meals   Getting Around   Cost &amp; Budgeting   Language   Culture &amp; Customs   Safety   Health &amp; Wellness     Staff                 Explore     Restaurants   Nightlife   Things to do   Local Travel   Regional Travel   Shopping                                                                       Info for Parents                                                                                                Info for External Advisers                                                                                                Visit Other NYU Global Centers                                                      La Pietra Dialogues LPD convenes some of the world\u2019s foremost scholars, policy makers, practitioners, business leaders, public intellectuals and artists whose ideas and work have made a significant cultural or intellectual contribution to global society and the revival of the spirit of humanism for which Florence is known.
