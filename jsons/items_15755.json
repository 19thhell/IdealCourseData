More than 100 high school, undergraduate, and  graduate students presented their research at this conference and  Bryan was one of 24 to be ranked as a Superior Presenter. His  research was titled &ldquo;Vital Improvements to the Youth Risk Behavior  Study: A Logical Approach.&rdquo; Bryan received a certificate, a medal,  and a nomination to join Sigma Xi.        The undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Most of the faculty is associated with the University&#8217;s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, noted for its advanced training and research programs.
