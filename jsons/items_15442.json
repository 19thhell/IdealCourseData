Current News/Projects  Updated June 2014     Pintupi dialogues: reconstructing memories of art, land and Community   through the visual record (Australian Research Council Linkage grant   2010-2013) .\u2028   I am currently completing work on an ARC Linkage grant to use visual   records to animate historical consciousness with the Pintupi   communities of Kintore, NT and Kiwirrkura, WA. This involves not only   returning to my earliest work in Pintupi communities, but also extending   my involvement with visual culture, representations, and art. The   grant is a collaboration with the mainly Pintupi Aboriginal-owned art   cooperative, Papunya Tula Artists Ltd., Dr. Peter Thorley of the   National Museum of Australia, and Professor Nicolas Peterson and Ms.   Philippa Deveson of the Australian National University, Dr Peter Thorley   of the National Museum of Australia, and myself of New York University.   Together with the members of these two remote Western Desert   communities, we are using film and photography to reflect on a pivotal   period in the history of the Pintupi people with whom I have been   working since 1973. In 1964, internationally renowned filmmaker, Ian   Dunlop accompanying then Patrol Officer Jeremy Long, had photographed Pintupi people as among the   last Aboriginal people still living a nomadic life in central   Australia's western desert. He returned in 1974 to film these same   people, now living at the government-supported Yayayi outstation where I   was carrying out my doctoral fieldwork.      (Fred Myers and Marlene Nampitjinpa Spencer discussing her memories of Yayayi) Using these visual records as the basis for a dialogue with the living   Pintupi descendants of those in the film and photographs, we are   reconstructing an account of how the Pintupi sought to fashion their own   modernity, with a particular emphasis on the great transition \u2013   sedentarization and incorporation into the Australian state -- in their   lives that took place in the 1960s and 1970s.     We have produced a film that attends to this dialogue, focusing on   Marlene Spencer Nampitjinpa's reflections on the film, entitled   \"Remembering Yayayi,\" Her reflections about herself and her family as   they appear in the footage incorporate points of view from several other   Pintupi consultants about the earlier film footage and the outstation.     As another distinct part of this, I am writing a book on the early   period of Pintupi living in this remote outstation community,   significant as one of the first outstation or homeland communities   established within the then-new policy framework of \u201cAboriginal   self-determination\u201d articulated by the Whitlam government upon its   election in 1973. The policies of \u201cself-determination\u201d \u2013 an expression   of international as well as local aspirations for colonized people --   have in recent years been heavily criticized by conservatives in   Australia as a failure and a significant cause of the many problems that   continue to plague Indigenous Australia. My goal in writing this book   is to confront these representations with an historically nuanced   account of life and the imaginings of a future in such a community.     Australian Cultural Fields: National and Transnational Dynamics  Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP140101970) \u2013 2014-2016     I am part of a new group project, funded by the Australian Research   Council and directed by Professor Tony Bennett of the University of   Western Sydney, that is just commencing. \"Australian Cultural Fields\"   examines the forces changing contemporary Australian culture. Focusing   on art, literature, media, sport, music and heritage, it assesses the   influence of transnationalism, digital media, migration and   multiculturalism, and the distinctive presence of Indigenous culture, on   the relations between culture, class, gender, ethnicity and nation.    The concept of \u2018cultural field\u2019 is taken from the work of sociologist   Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea to investigate how the   production and consumption of culture are affected by relations between   cultural institutions, policy agencies, and cultural markets. Australian   Cultural Fields will develop this perspective in number of ways. It   will be the first study to examine transnational forces, new information   technologies and the changing salience of migrant and Indigenous   cultures in the contemporary Australian context. Internationally, it   will be the first large-scale study to interrogate the relations between   the fields of cultural production and consumption.     It is going to be a challenge for me to work with new methodologies and   kinds of information, but very exciting. I will be working with some of   the leading scholars in Australian Cultural Studies -- Tony Bennett,   Graeme Turner, Greg Noble, David Rowe, David Carter, Deborah Stevenson,   Emma Waterton, and my old friend Tim Rowse.

Cultural Heritage Studies offers students a broad introduction to the practice, history, and theoretical reflection of cultural heritage formation and preservation, especially in the area of material culture. Museums and organizations and institutions of cultural policy management make up the two fields of professional activity that are central to the program. Accordingly, the program follows two tracks: one focuses on museums as laboratories of cultural heritage production, the other on strategies of, and issues in, cultural policy management.   The notion of an internationally and cross-culturally &quot;shared heritage&quot; of material culture is the central theme of the entire program. The types of objects, and (museum) collections of objects to which this notion relates, derive from, and belong to, all realms and ages of human productivity. The academic disciplines studying these objects and collections, such as anthropology, archaeology, history, art history, history of science, and modern media studies, inform the wide palette of heuristic perspectives from which students investigate processes and traditions of cultural heritage formation and preservation. They do so through readings, classroom discussions, short research papers, and visits to professional institutions.   The museums that are currently being built in close vicinity to NYU Abu Dhabi's permanent campus on Saadiyat Island \u2014 the Sheikh Zayed National Museum , the Louvre Abu Dhabi , and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi \u2014 are important objects of study, discussion, and visits in their own right, as are regional organizations of cultural policy and heritage management, such as the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage (ADACH) and the Tourism Development &amp; Investment Company (TDIC). Institutions such as these also offer opportunities for internships and Capstone projects . Courses and internships are available at NYU New York and at NYU's global sites.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

ANTH-AD 102J Anthropology of Indigenous Australia: Art, Politics and Cultural Futures                                                                   This course offers an introduction to some of the current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia, considering a range of Aboriginal forms of social being, ranging historically and geographically and giving significant focus to the changing relationships between Indigenous people and the settler nation of Australia. We will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination &ndash; in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism &ndash; in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms. While those in the dominant society thought at first that Aboriginal people and their culture would &ldquo;die out&rdquo; and later that they would or could be simply &ldquo;assimilated,&rdquo; we will trace a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what W.E.H. Stanner called &ldquo;the great Australian silence&rdquo; and asserting their right to a cultural future. This will include assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course will make use of several museums in Sydney, and a few prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present their work relevant to the theme.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course focuses on the formation of the modern museum. Museums of art, natural history, science, technology, and anthropology are examined from a variety of disciplinary approaches that explore the institution and its practices with respect to governance, colonialism, nationalism, class, gender, ethnicity, and community. Visits to the museums and cultural institutions in the region are an important part of this course.

The purposes, processes, and ethics of such fundamental tasks as acquisitions, conservation, installations, exhibitions, and interpretation are examined in detail with particular attention to how the work of art is perceived in its many different guises and contexts. The role of museums in our age of globalization are also be discussed. Some classes may be taught on site and individual museum visits by students may be required.

Famous is the Silk Road, but over the centuries many other regions were also connected through trade. These activities left behind various cultural traces&mdash;in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, and archives. These cultural footprints are now considered \"shared cultural heritage.\" Important junctions in the network are often also recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their universal and global value. In this course students study the basic theory of cultural heritage and explore the various perspectives on heritage. Terminology like shared, mutual, global, and contested heritage are discussed. The acquired knowledge and insights will be applied in a research assignment at a World Heritage Site, Galle in Sri Lanka.

This course considers a range of art practices and their relation to the communities in which they are produced. The professor brings the class to the Queens Museum (which he directs) to look at how an art institution can be engaged in the social issues of a community, and leads site visits to other city institutions both international and local in their focus. We also visit urban spaces transformed by art from Battery Park City to the subway lines adorned by the city&rsquo;s Arts for Transit Program. Fundamental questions addressed in the course include: How should a museum serve its audience? Should we use the same criteria to assess the success of an artwork in a gallery and on a subway platform?

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

MUSST-AD 215J Museums in Global Context                                             This course surveys the history and representational role of museums, from its origins in cabinets of curiosity formed during the age of exploration to the global proliferation of museums today. Our goal is to provide a critical framework to understand how and why museums have evolved and function in a globalized world. We will consider how Enlightment collecting practices led to the development of the &ldquo;universal museum&rdquo; in an era of colonial expansion and examine how this dominant model has expanded &ndash; and been challenged &ndash; over the past century. Among the issues to be discussed are: the organization and display of collections, the language and symbolism of museum architecture, the relationship of museums to their public(s), heritage and repatriation, cultural diversity and the politics of representation, and globalized collecting and exhibiting today. Classroom lectures will be supplemented by field trips drawing on the rich diversity of museums in the New York area.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course explores the consequences for art and scholarship of the recent museum boom and asks what might it take to produce a change of direction.
