Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336).

FALL 2012 MAP-UA 9548 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Prague\u2014In the Heart of Central Europe Prof. Mucha (NYU-Prague) The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region.

The Italian city, and in particular Florence, will serve as our primary unit of measurement for investigating Italy. To this end, we visit a number of sites in Florence and in Tuscany in order to conduct fieldwork to structure and inform our scholarly conversations and written work.        SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 9723 Expressive Culture: Museums in Washington Field Study Prof. Grossman (NYU-Washington D.C.) With its vast array of institutions dedicated to distinct cultural groupings and its formation inextricably linked to the halls of power, the museum culture in our nation\u2019s capitol unique. Taking advantage of behind-the-scenes access to some of the most prestigious museums in the world and their staff, students explore various approaches to interpreting art and develop tools for appreciating their aesthetic experiences. We also look critically at the ways in which museums\u2014through their policies, programs, exhibitions, and architecture\u2014can define regional or national values, shape cultural attitudes, inform social and political views, and even affect one\u2019s understanding of the meaning of a work of art.        SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 9549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Woods (NYU-London)          SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 9544 Cultures and Contexts: Spain\u2014At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America Prof. Suarez-Galban (NYU-Madrid) Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.        SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 9547 Cultures and Contexts: Multiculturalism in France Prof. Epstein (NYU-Paris)        SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 9510 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia\u2014Between East and West  Prof. Salamon (NYU-Prague) The complex evolution of Russian cultural identity explored in juxtaposition to parallel developments of other Eastern European cultures, highlighting the emergence of individual and collective self struggling for freedom of self-determination within the context of societies which for cultural, religious, or political reasons hinder such aspirations, and examined through some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, ritual, belief, gender, individuality, and community.         SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 9548 Cultures and Contexts: Prague\u2014In the Heart of Central Europe Prof. Mucha (NYU-Prague) The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment. SUMMER 2013 MAP-UA 9554 Cultures and Contexts: Italy Second Six-Week Summer Session, June 30-August 10, 2013 Prof. Edelstein (NYU-Florence)  In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.     top of page         Courses           Quantitative Reasoning           Natural Science I           Natural Science II           Texts and Ideas           Cultures and Contexts           Societies and the Social Sciences           Expressive Culture           Study Away                       Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Undergraduate Program    |     Hellenic Studies    | New York University                                   Skip to page Content.
