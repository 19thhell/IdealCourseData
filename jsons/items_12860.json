As the mental health needs of college students increase, both in the number of students seeking services and the severity of the pathology, 2 it is imperative that NYU continue to develop innovative approaches to engage students in necessary treatments.             Key Facts     Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds. 3   22.5% of NYU students reported that anxiety had impacted their academic performance in the past 12 months. 4   55% of NYU students reported that emotional or mental difficulties had hurt their academic performance for one or more days in the past month. 5   59% of NYU students demonstrating symptoms of depression reported that problems resulting from these symptoms had made it difficult forthem to do their schoolwork, take care of things at home, or get along with other people. 5   17.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing serious psychological distress in 2007. 5   8.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing a major depressive episode within the past year. 7   90% of college or university counseling center directors in the United States report an increase in psychological problems among their students. 7   The proportion of students, nationally, with a previous diagnosis of depression increased from 10% to 15% between 2000 and 2005. 8   75% of lifetime mental disorders have first onset by the typical college age range of 18-24. 9                                           Recommendations     Develop mental health outreach targeted to specific at-risk student groups to increase utilization of treatment.  Students from different backgrounds may experience greater levels of stigma toward mental health issues. For example, studies have shown that Asian international students - compared with American students - experience greater discomfort or shame with counseling, less openness to counseling, and a greater preference for a flexible counseling format. 10 Young adults who perceive public stigma surrounding mental illness are less likely to perceive a need to seek help. 11 This perception of stigma can contribute to underutilization of university mental health services, while concerns regarding language and culture can act as barriers to counseling. 10 New models advocate for a culturally sensitive continuity of care which tailors mental health outreach and services to diverse groups of people. 12 Ensuring that NYU\u2019s counseling services are culturally competent to accommodate the needs of a diverse student population is a necessity.       Raise student awareness of the impact of anxiety and depression on their ability to learn, function, and succeed.  Depression is a significant predictor of not only GPA but also the likelihood of withdrawing from the university. 1 Untreated depression is associated with a decrease ofa 0.49 point, or half a letter grade, in a student\u2019s grade point average. 13 In contrast, treatment for depression is correlated with a protective effect of 0.44 points. 13 Students who report greater psychological distress also tend to view themselves as less capable of succeeding, are more anxious about their class performance, 14 and possess lower self-efficacy and resource management skills. 13 With increased knowledge of the impact of mental health issues on their academic performance and college experience, students may be more likely to seek help or support.       Educate university staff and faculty about the impact of anxiety and depression on learning outcomes, ability to function, and student success.   By virtue of their interactions with students, university staff and faculty are uniquely positioned to have a positive impact on their students\u2019 mental health. Research has shown that when faculty and students are trained to recognize symptoms of depression, students may increase treatment-seeking behaviors. 15 Studies have emphasized the importance of training faculty and staff to understand the relationship between mental health and learning. 16 Additionally, graduate students who have functional relationships with their advisors are less prone to report emotional or stress-related problems. 17 Creating a university-wide culture and environment that encourages inclusiveness and support to augment campus mental health services has been recommended to improve outcomes for students. 16       Expand the development and utilization of holistic therapeutic interventions.  Evidence-based holistic interventions, such as biofeedback, art therapy, and music therapy have been shown to supplement traditional mental health treatments. Participation in the arts can benefit those with mental health difficulties, particularly increasing feelings of empowerment 18 and coping abilities. 19 Students using biofeedback in combination with relaxation techniques reported significantly lower anxiety and less mental and physical manifestations of stress than did those using relaxation techniques alone. 20 Music, as used by music therapists, has the potential to ameliorate the mental health of those with a variety of psychiatric conditions. 21 The expansion of holistic therapeutic intervention offerings may be particularly effective for students with emotional adjustment problems and serve to augment treatment for students with a mental health diagnosis.       Improve the coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community.  Fragmentation of the behavioral health service delivery system is noted as a significant obstacle to the receipt of quality mental health care. 22,23 Monitoring treatment compliance and efficacy among students diagnosed with depression using a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach among NYU primary care and counseling services as well as case management has been shown to ensure that students with mental health needs receive optimal treatment. 24 NYU students in need of long-term counseling are referred from Counseling and Wellness Services to high-quality clinicians in the community. Enhancing partnerships and improving coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community ensures that more students will receive effective and necessary mental health care.       Strengthen connections between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and student-run mental health interest groups and initiatives.   Student-run mental health initiatives, such as advocacy groups or peer-led education and support, are important components of suicide prevention and mental health promotion. Operating in conjunction with treatment, student mental health interest groups contribute to an atmosphere of inclusion and empowerment for mentally ill students. 25 Research suggests that when students become involved with student-run campus mental health awareness and/or advocacy groups, such as Active Minds, their attitudes of stigma toward mental illness decrease. 25 Furthermore, interpersonal contact between those with mental illness and those without is an effective strategy in reducing stigmatizing views of people with mental health issues. 25                                                           Indicator Technical Notes                               a) Engagement in mental health treatment among students who have seriously considered suicide     Data Source: ACHA #30J &amp; #31A1-31B7   Survey Questions: Have you ever seriously considered suicide? &amp; Within the last 12 months have you been diagnosed or treated by a professional for any of the following: anorexia; anxiety; ADHA; bipolar disorder; bulimia; depression; insomnia; other sleep disorder; OCD; panic attacks; phobia; schizophrenia; substance abuse or addiction; other addiction; other mental health condition?

The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems. Read more...          Psychiatry     Our innovative model for psychiatric medication management services provides students with access to psychiatric medication services throughout their NYU career at a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $30 per visit.

Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...

As the mental health needs of college students increase, both in the number of students seeking services and the severity of the pathology, 2 it is imperative that NYU continue to develop innovative approaches to engage students in necessary treatments.             Key Facts     Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds. 3   22.5% of NYU students reported that anxiety had impacted their academic performance in the past 12 months. 4   55% of NYU students reported that emotional or mental difficulties had hurt their academic performance for one or more days in the past month. 5   59% of NYU students demonstrating symptoms of depression reported that problems resulting from these symptoms had made it difficult forthem to do their schoolwork, take care of things at home, or get along with other people. 5   17.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing serious psychological distress in 2007. 5   8.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing a major depressive episode within the past year. 7   90% of college or university counseling center directors in the United States report an increase in psychological problems among their students. 7   The proportion of students, nationally, with a previous diagnosis of depression increased from 10% to 15% between 2000 and 2005. 8   75% of lifetime mental disorders have first onset by the typical college age range of 18-24. 9                                           Recommendations     Develop mental health outreach targeted to specific at-risk student groups to increase utilization of treatment.  Students from different backgrounds may experience greater levels of stigma toward mental health issues. For example, studies have shown that Asian international students - compared with American students - experience greater discomfort or shame with counseling, less openness to counseling, and a greater preference for a flexible counseling format. 10 Young adults who perceive public stigma surrounding mental illness are less likely to perceive a need to seek help. 11 This perception of stigma can contribute to underutilization of university mental health services, while concerns regarding language and culture can act as barriers to counseling. 10 New models advocate for a culturally sensitive continuity of care which tailors mental health outreach and services to diverse groups of people. 12 Ensuring that NYU\u2019s counseling services are culturally competent to accommodate the needs of a diverse student population is a necessity.       Raise student awareness of the impact of anxiety and depression on their ability to learn, function, and succeed.  Depression is a significant predictor of not only GPA but also the likelihood of withdrawing from the university. 1 Untreated depression is associated with a decrease ofa 0.49 point, or half a letter grade, in a student\u2019s grade point average. 13 In contrast, treatment for depression is correlated with a protective effect of 0.44 points. 13 Students who report greater psychological distress also tend to view themselves as less capable of succeeding, are more anxious about their class performance, 14 and possess lower self-efficacy and resource management skills. 13 With increased knowledge of the impact of mental health issues on their academic performance and college experience, students may be more likely to seek help or support.       Educate university staff and faculty about the impact of anxiety and depression on learning outcomes, ability to function, and student success.   By virtue of their interactions with students, university staff and faculty are uniquely positioned to have a positive impact on their students\u2019 mental health. Research has shown that when faculty and students are trained to recognize symptoms of depression, students may increase treatment-seeking behaviors. 15 Studies have emphasized the importance of training faculty and staff to understand the relationship between mental health and learning. 16 Additionally, graduate students who have functional relationships with their advisors are less prone to report emotional or stress-related problems. 17 Creating a university-wide culture and environment that encourages inclusiveness and support to augment campus mental health services has been recommended to improve outcomes for students. 16       Expand the development and utilization of holistic therapeutic interventions.  Evidence-based holistic interventions, such as biofeedback, art therapy, and music therapy have been shown to supplement traditional mental health treatments. Participation in the arts can benefit those with mental health difficulties, particularly increasing feelings of empowerment 18 and coping abilities. 19 Students using biofeedback in combination with relaxation techniques reported significantly lower anxiety and less mental and physical manifestations of stress than did those using relaxation techniques alone. 20 Music, as used by music therapists, has the potential to ameliorate the mental health of those with a variety of psychiatric conditions. 21 The expansion of holistic therapeutic intervention offerings may be particularly effective for students with emotional adjustment problems and serve to augment treatment for students with a mental health diagnosis.       Improve the coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community.  Fragmentation of the behavioral health service delivery system is noted as a significant obstacle to the receipt of quality mental health care. 22,23 Monitoring treatment compliance and efficacy among students diagnosed with depression using a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach among NYU primary care and counseling services as well as case management has been shown to ensure that students with mental health needs receive optimal treatment. 24 NYU students in need of long-term counseling are referred from Counseling and Wellness Services to high-quality clinicians in the community. Enhancing partnerships and improving coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community ensures that more students will receive effective and necessary mental health care.       Strengthen connections between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and student-run mental health interest groups and initiatives.   Student-run mental health initiatives, such as advocacy groups or peer-led education and support, are important components of suicide prevention and mental health promotion. Operating in conjunction with treatment, student mental health interest groups contribute to an atmosphere of inclusion and empowerment for mentally ill students. 25 Research suggests that when students become involved with student-run campus mental health awareness and/or advocacy groups, such as Active Minds, their attitudes of stigma toward mental illness decrease. 25 Furthermore, interpersonal contact between those with mental illness and those without is an effective strategy in reducing stigmatizing views of people with mental health issues. 25                                                           Indicator Technical Notes                               a) Engagement in mental health treatment among students who have seriously considered suicide     Data Source: ACHA #30J &amp; #31A1-31B7   Survey Questions: Have you ever seriously considered suicide? &amp; Within the last 12 months have you been diagnosed or treated by a professional for any of the following: anorexia; anxiety; ADHA; bipolar disorder; bulimia; depression; insomnia; other sleep disorder; OCD; panic attacks; phobia; schizophrenia; substance abuse or addiction; other addiction; other mental health condition?

This club aims to provide a forum and a safe space to explore ideas and share experiences. We hope to generate dialogue and allyship, advocacy and activism. We aim to inspire civic engagement and expand student knowledge on a variety of issues and identities. We broadly define disability to include both visible and invisible, learning disabilities, mental illness, chronic pain, chronic illness, and temporary disabilities. In addition, we welcome an evolving understanding of our definition of disability.

Increasingly health care scholars have recognized that health care involves more than bodies and biology; it also involves human meaning, purpose, and culture. And, in the other direction, humanities scholars have increasingly recognized the bodily dimensions of human subjectivity and culture. People are more than their hopes, dreams, and imagination; they are also embodied creatures intimately connected to their biology. Thus, to understand this side of human side of medicine and the bodily side of humanity, academic centers must foster quality inquiry into this rapidly growing interdisciplinary domain.   ASD Nest Support Project  Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development   Department of Teaching and Learning, Programs in Special Education   NYU's partnership with New York City&rsquo;s Department of Education (DoE) and Hunter College&rsquo;s School of Education began in 2001 to fill a gap in the programs the DoE offered for higher functioning children on the autism spectrum. The fruit of that collaboration was the new ASD Nest program, piloted at PS 32 in Brooklyn in September 2003. Its goal was and is to help these children learn how to function well academically, behaviorally and socially in school and in their community. Now, in the 2011-12 school year, the New York City school system serves 500 children with ASDs in 131 fully inclusive Nest classrooms in 19 elementary schools, three middle schools and one high school.

Masters Scholars in Medical Humanism Program   NYU Medical School     The Master Scholars in Medical Humanism Program (MSMHP) is a component of the Office of Student Affairs developed to complement the culture of medical education by encouraging students to explore intellectual and artistic interests not necessarily covered in the core curriculum. Through innovative seminars, colloquia, and events moderated by expert facilitators, students are encouraged to pursue their interests outside of the classroom to better prepare them for their practice and inevitably make a meaningful difference in the individual lives of patients.   The MSMHP invites students to develop new opportunities to promote conversations in medicine and humanities; past events have included lectures with nationally recognized faculty, writers and artists, film screenings, visits to off-site museums, concerts and performance arts, and collaborations with other NYU programs.
