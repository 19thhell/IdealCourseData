Professor Morrison's research focuses on different ways in which employees behave proactively at work, the conditions that motivate and enable such behavior, and how various types of proactive behavior both facilitate career success and improve organizational effectiveness. Her research also focuses on employee voice and silence, and in particular, the reasons why employees are often reluctant to speak up about problems and concerns, and how organizations can create climates more open to employee input. She has won several awards for her research, including the Cummings Scholar Award from the Organizational Behavior Division of the Academy of Management.     Professor Morrison has published her work in a wide range of journals, including Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Organizational Behavior and Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes . She has served on the Executive Committee of the Organizational Behavior Division of the Academy of Management (2008-2013) and as Associate Editor for Academy of Management Journal (2007-2010). She teaches courses in Leadership, Collaboration and Negotiation, and Organizational Behavior.
