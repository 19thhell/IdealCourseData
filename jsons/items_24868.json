The study of PDE has been a central research theme at the Courant Institute since its foundation. Themes are extremely varied, ranging from abstract questions (existence, uniqueness of solutions) to more concrete ones (qualitative or quantitative information on the behaviour of solutions, often in relation with simulations).

Domains of interest range from stochastic processes to statistical physics (percolation, random matrices&hellip;), which has become more and more central in recent years.

Siegel  Joel H. Spencer  Chee K. Yap     Three key issues for an algorithm are: Is it correct? How efficient is it? Can one do better? Our strong and diverse group seeks provable answers to these questions. It focuses on problems and questions in the following areas: computational geometry, computational algebra, randomness (in algorithm design and average case analysis), computational biology, correctness of programs and hardware, and game theory.    Richard Cole has worked on a wide range of algorithmic topics. His current focus is the new area of algorithmic economics. One of the fundamental notions in economics is the concept of equilibrium: for example, prices that approximately balance supply and demand are expected to be the norm. From a computer science perspective, for an equilibrium to be attainable, it has to be computationally feasible to find equilibrium prices and, in addition, the market itself must be able to \"compute\" such prices. Prof. Cole, his collaborators, and students are studying the computational hardness of the pricing problem and specific pricing algorithms for different market and agent models.    Yevgeniy Dodis is primarily interested in cryptography. His current primary research directions are cryptography based on imperfect randomness, exposure-resilient cryptography, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash functions and random oracle model and information-theoretic cryptography. Recent achievements include design of special purpose randomness extractors for imperfect sources, formal model of cryptography based on noisy data, design and formalization of intrusion-resilient cryptosystems and new criteria and techniques for design of hash functions.    Subhash Khot is broadly interested in all aspects of algorithms and computational complexity. His specific interests include efficiently computing approximate solutions to NP-hard problems and negative results showing that for many problems, even computing approximate solutions is intractable. His recent works include negative results for semi-definite programming based algorithms, their connection to metric geometry and analysis, and negative results for some learning theory problems.    Bud Mishra has worked in many areas of Computer Science. His current focus is on applications of computer science and mathematical ideas to biological sciences. He has developed optical mapping technology, a successful approach to physical genome mapping. He aims to develop efficient practical algorithmic tools for genome mapping and sequencing. He leads a number of projects in bioinformatics, primarily in genomics and systems biology, including a novel technology aimed at making fast and cheap sequencing of the human genome broadly accessible, a cancer genome atlas, algebraic model checking for systems biology, large-scale models of pandemic flu and smallpox and many others.    Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing.    Oded Regev's research is in mathematical aspects of theoretical computer science. He is particularly interested in advancing the area of lattice-based cryptography using concepts from quantum computation, analysis, and number theory.    Victor Shoup 's research areas are cryptography and computational number theory; he is especially interested in the interactions between these two areas. He designs and analyzes cryptographic primitives and protocols with security properties that can be proven based on clear and reasonable assumptions, and which are nevertheless practical enough to use in the real world. Most recently, he has been working on practical secure deniable protocols (i.e., participants in an exchange using this protocol can deny that it ever took place) based on novel and use of number-theoretic algorithms.    Alan Siegel is interested in the analysis of algorithms and related mathematics, which includes applications from probability, statistics, partial and ordinary differential equations and methods in asymptotic analysis. He works on analysis of probabilistic processes and geometric arrangements of lines. His current research focuses on hashing functions and their properties. He is also interested in K-12 mathematics education and new approaches to teaching algorithms at the college and graduate level.    Joel Spencer is interested in applications of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. He worked on many topics including Ramsey theory (which studies the conditions under which order must appear in random systems), discrepancy theory (which deals with measuring irregularities of discrete distributions), random graphs and their connections to logic and randomized greedy methods. He is the author of a number of widely known books on probabilistic method.    Chee Yap works in the areas of computational geometry, algebraic computation and visualization. His current research focuses on two themes: exact arithmetic computation and large-scale visualization. Numerical nonrobustness has been called \"computer scientists' dirty secret\" --everyone knows that our numerical software can break, but we rarely talk about it. The most successful approach to solving the robustness problem in geometry is based on exact geometric computation. Chee Yap and his group are developing techniques for this type of computation based on algebraic zero bounds. Exact geometric computation provides considerable insight into the theory of real computation. The other direction of Chee Yap's work is large-scale visualization, dynamic visualization of geospatial data in particular.

The study of PDE has been a central research theme at the Courant Institute since its foundation. Themes are extremely varied, ranging from abstract questions (existence, uniqueness of solutions) to more concrete ones (qualitative or quantitative information on the behaviour of solutions, often in relation with simulations). The study of PDE has strong ties with analysis: methods from Fourier Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory are at the heart of PDE theory, and theory of PDEs often suggest fundamental questions in these domains.

Dynamical Systems :   Tim Austin, Yuri Bakhtin, Lai-Sang Young               PROBABILITY THEORY        In the 1960s, the Sloan foundation helped build up a probability group at the Courant Institute. Monroe Donsker and Raghu Varadhan joined the Institute, where the theory of probability has thrived ever since. Domains of interest range from stochastic processes to statistical physics (percolation, random matrices&hellip;), which has become more and more central in recent years. Probability theory has natural connections with a number of fields (computational methods, financial mathematics, mathematical physics, dynamical systems) since a great number of phenomena can be best modeled or understood by probabilistic means.

Siegel  Joel H. Spencer  Chee K. Yap     Three key issues for an algorithm are: Is it correct? How efficient is it? Can one do better? Our strong and diverse group seeks provable answers to these questions. It focuses on problems and questions in the following areas: computational geometry, computational algebra, randomness (in algorithm design and average case analysis), computational biology, correctness of programs and hardware, and game theory.    Richard Cole has worked on a wide range of algorithmic topics. His current focus is the new area of algorithmic economics. One of the fundamental notions in economics is the concept of equilibrium: for example, prices that approximately balance supply and demand are expected to be the norm. From a computer science perspective, for an equilibrium to be attainable, it has to be computationally feasible to find equilibrium prices and, in addition, the market itself must be able to \"compute\" such prices. Prof. Cole, his collaborators, and students are studying the computational hardness of the pricing problem and specific pricing algorithms for different market and agent models.    Yevgeniy Dodis is primarily interested in cryptography. His current primary research directions are cryptography based on imperfect randomness, exposure-resilient cryptography, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash functions and random oracle model and information-theoretic cryptography. Recent achievements include design of special purpose randomness extractors for imperfect sources, formal model of cryptography based on noisy data, design and formalization of intrusion-resilient cryptosystems and new criteria and techniques for design of hash functions.    Subhash Khot is broadly interested in all aspects of algorithms and computational complexity. His specific interests include efficiently computing approximate solutions to NP-hard problems and negative results showing that for many problems, even computing approximate solutions is intractable. His recent works include negative results for semi-definite programming based algorithms, their connection to metric geometry and analysis, and negative results for some learning theory problems.    Bud Mishra has worked in many areas of Computer Science. His current focus is on applications of computer science and mathematical ideas to biological sciences. He has developed optical mapping technology, a successful approach to physical genome mapping. He aims to develop efficient practical algorithmic tools for genome mapping and sequencing. He leads a number of projects in bioinformatics, primarily in genomics and systems biology, including a novel technology aimed at making fast and cheap sequencing of the human genome broadly accessible, a cancer genome atlas, algebraic model checking for systems biology, large-scale models of pandemic flu and smallpox and many others.    Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing.    Oded Regev's research is in mathematical aspects of theoretical computer science. He is particularly interested in advancing the area of lattice-based cryptography using concepts from quantum computation, analysis, and number theory.    Victor Shoup 's research areas are cryptography and computational number theory; he is especially interested in the interactions between these two areas. He designs and analyzes cryptographic primitives and protocols with security properties that can be proven based on clear and reasonable assumptions, and which are nevertheless practical enough to use in the real world. Most recently, he has been working on practical secure deniable protocols (i.e., participants in an exchange using this protocol can deny that it ever took place) based on novel and use of number-theoretic algorithms.    Alan Siegel is interested in the analysis of algorithms and related mathematics, which includes applications from probability, statistics, partial and ordinary differential equations and methods in asymptotic analysis. He works on analysis of probabilistic processes and geometric arrangements of lines. His current research focuses on hashing functions and their properties. He is also interested in K-12 mathematics education and new approaches to teaching algorithms at the college and graduate level.    Joel Spencer is interested in applications of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. He worked on many topics including Ramsey theory (which studies the conditions under which order must appear in random systems), discrepancy theory (which deals with measuring irregularities of discrete distributions), random graphs and their connections to logic and randomized greedy methods. He is the author of a number of widely known books on probabilistic method.    Chee Yap works in the areas of computational geometry, algebraic computation and visualization. His current research focuses on two themes: exact arithmetic computation and large-scale visualization. Numerical nonrobustness has been called \"computer scientists' dirty secret\" --everyone knows that our numerical software can break, but we rarely talk about it. The most successful approach to solving the robustness problem in geometry is based on exact geometric computation. Chee Yap and his group are developing techniques for this type of computation based on algebraic zero bounds. Exact geometric computation provides considerable insight into the theory of real computation. The other direction of Chee Yap's work is large-scale visualization, dynamic visualization of geospatial data in particular.

Below we list some of the current areas of research.  The choice of categories is somewhat arbitrary, as many faculty have  interests that cut across boundaries, and the fields continue to evolve.        We give a very brief overview of the research in each area; more  detailed information may be found on individual faculty webpages.           Physical Applied Mathematics    Scientific Computing    Computational and Mathematical Biology    Analysis and PDE    Algebraic Geometry    Geometry    Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory    Probability Theory         PHYSICAL APPLIED MATHEMATICS      A central theme at the Courant Institute is the study of physical  systems using advanced methods of applied mathematics. Currently,  areas of focus include fluid dynamics, plasma physics, statistical  mechanics, molecular dynamics and dynamical systems. The tradition  at the Institute is to investigate fundamental questions as well as  to solve problems with direct, real-world applications. In doing so,  the people looking into these questions build on the strong synergies  and fresh ideas that emerge in the frequent collaboration with  analysis and PDE specialists as well as experts in scientific  computing at the institute.

Central  to much of this work is the development of robust and efficient  algorithms. As these algorithms are applied to increasingly complex  problems, significant attention is being devoted to the design of  effective and supportable software.              Computational Physics :   Marsha Berger, Antoine Cerfon, Aleksandar Donev, Dimitris Giannakis, Jonathan Goodman,   Leslie Greengard, Michael O'Neil, Michael Shelley, Georg Stadler, Margaret Wright, Denis Zorin         Numerical Analysis :   Michael Overton, Aaditya Rangan, Nick Trefethen, Olof Widlund         Scattering Theory :   Yu Chen, Leslie Greengard           COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY      Biological applications of mathematics and computing at Courant include genome analysis, biomolecular structure and dynamics, systems biology, embryology, immunology, neuroscience, heart physiology, biofluid dynamics, and medical imaging. The students, researchers and faculty who work on these questions are pure and applied mathematicians and computer scientists working in close collaboration with biological and medical colleagues at NYU and elsewhere.            Computational Neuroscience:    David McLaughlin, Charles Peskin, Aaditya Rangan, John Rinzel, Daniel Tranchina         Computational Biology:    Leslie Greengard, Bhubaneswar Mishra, Alex Mogilner, Mehryar Mohri, Aaditya Rangan, Daniel Tranchina         Mathematical Biology:    David Cai, Alex Mogilner, Charles Newman, Jerome Percus, Charles Peskin               ANALYSIS AND PDE      Most, if not all, physical systems can be modeled by Partial Differential Equations (PDE): from continuum mechanics (including fluid mechanics and material science) to quantum mechanics or general relativity. The study of PDE has been a central research theme at the Courant Institute since its foundation. Themes are extremely varied, ranging from abstract questions (existence, uniqueness of solutions) to more concrete ones (qualitative or quantitative information on the behaviour of solutions, often in relation with simulations). The study of PDE has strong ties with analysis: methods from Fourier Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory are at the heart of PDE theory, and theory of PDEs often suggest fundamental questions in these domains.            Calculus of Variations :   Bob Kohn, Sylvia Serfaty         Elliptic and Parabolic Problems :   Fengbo Hang, Bob Kohn, Fang-Hua Lin, Nader Masmoudi, Sylvia Serfaty         Geometric Measure Theory :   Fang-Hua Lin         Harmonic Analysis :   Pierre Germain, Sinan Gunturk         Integrable Systems :   Percy Deift, Henry McKean         Mathematical Elasticity :   Bob Kohn         Mathematical Fluid Mechanics :   Pierre Germain, Jonathan Goodman, Nader Masmoudi, Jalal Shatah         Nonlinear Waves :   Pierre Germain, Nader Masmoudi, Jalal Shatah         Spectral Theory :   Percy Deift             ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY      The research focus of the Algebraic geometry group at Courant lies at the  interface of geometry, topology, and number theory. Of particular interest  are problems concerning the existence and distribution of rational points  and rational curves on higher-dimensional varieties, group actions and  hidden symmetries, as well as rationality, unirationality, and hyperbolicity  properties of algebraic varieties.            Algebraic Groups and Representation Theory :   Fedor Bogomolov, Fred Greenleaf, Yuri Tschinkel         Arithmetic Geometry :   Fedor Bogomolov, Yuri Tschinkel         Complex Algebraic Geometry :   Fedor Bogomolov, Sylvain Cappell, Yuri Tschinkel         Holomorphic Symplectic Geometry :   Fedor Bogomolov, Yuri Tschinkel         Number Theory :   Yuri Tschinkel             GEOMETRY      Geometry research at Courant blends differential and metric geometry with analysis and topology. The geometry group has strong ties with analysis and partial differential equations, as there are many PDE&#39;s and techniques of interest to both groups, such as  Einstein&#39;s equations, the minimal surface equation, calculus of variations, and geometric measure theory.            Symplectic Geometry :   Sylvain Cappell, Mikhael Gromov         Geometric Analysis :   Jeff Cheeger, Mikhael Gromov, Fengbo Hang, Bruce Kleiner, Fang-Hua Lin, Robert Young         Geometric Group Theory :   Tim Austin, Mikhael Gromov, Bruce Kleiner, Assaf Naor, Robert Young         Metric Geometry :   Jeff Cheeger, Mikhael Gromov, Bruce Kleiner, Assaf Naor, Robert Young         Geometric Topology :   Sylvain Cappell, Bruce Kleiner             DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND ERGODIC THEORY      The subject of dynamical systems is concerned with systems that evolve over time according to a well-defined rule, which could be either deterministic or probabilistic; examples of such systems arise in almost any field of science. Ergodic theory is a branch of dynamical systems concerned with measure preserving transformation of measure spaces, such as the dynamical systems associated with Hamiltonian mechanics.
