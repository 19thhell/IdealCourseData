The goal of the program is to train and prepare child and adolescent psychiatrists to meet the challenging demands of a complex and expanding field while translating research into effective clinical care. Graduating residents have the necessary knowledge and clinical skills to function independently as medical specialists in coordinating and delivering skilled and comprehensive treatment to children and adolescents who have psychiatric disorders.   The child and adolescent psychiatry program at NYU is one of the oldest in the country with a longstanding tradition of combining clinical and research excellence. The multi-disciplinary faculty of behavioral scientists and clinicians is committed to providing state-of-the-art care in their quest to assist children, adolescents and their families.   The NYU Child Study Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, and the Rockland Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center (RCPC) offer a unique combination of comprehensive clinical facilities serving diverse patient populations. Residents gain clinical experience at Bellevue on the Child Inpatient Service (the first in the United States); the Adolescent Inpatient Service (also the first in the country); the Adolescent Day Hospital; the Pediatric Emergency Service; Public School 35M (one of the first public school programs established in a hospital); the Child and Adolescent Mental Hygiene Clinic (which includes a Therapeutic Nursery/Preschool); and the Pediatric Consultation-Liaison Service. At NYU there are clinical opportunities at Tisch Hospital's inpatient Young Adult Program; pediatric consultation liaison activities at Tisch Hospital, Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, and Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders; and the varied components of the NYU Child Study Center. First year child residents also rotate at RCPC, an intensive, family-based inpatient program, where they learn to psychiatrically diagnose and treat some of the most troubled and disruptive children in the state.   This comprehensive didactic/supervisory program offers year-long seminars on child and adolescent development and psychopathology as well as two years of psychopharmacology; continuous case seminars (by members of the NYU Psychoanalytic Institute) and seminars in assessment; research; treatment modalities; forensics; ethics; substance abuse; and other related child and adolescent mental health issues. NYU Child Study Center holds one of the few weekly grand rounds in child and adolescent psychiatry in the country. At these presentations residents hear from national experts each week and then meet with the speaker for lunch immediately afterwards, providing more opportunities for learning, mentorship, and future collaboration.   The Family Studies Program, in collaboration with the Ackerman Institute of Family Therapy, offers a first-year didactic seminar and two years of weekly live family therapy supervision. Second-year residents also have weekly group and cognitive behavior therapy supervision. Individual long-term therapy supervision is provided throughout the two years along with individual supervision by attending on clinical rotations.   The Department has one of seven federally funded Research Units for Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP). Residents are welcome to participate in ongoing research through RUPP or the many other ongoing research studies at the NYU Child Study Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, or RCPC.

The goal of the program is to train and prepare child and adolescent psychiatrists to meet the challenging demands of a complex and expanding field while translating research into effective clinical care. Graduating residents have the necessary knowledge and clinical skills to function independently as medical specialists in coordinating and delivering skilled and comprehensive treatment to children and adolescents who have psychiatric disorders.   The child and adolescent psychiatry program at NYU is one of the oldest in the country with a longstanding tradition of combining clinical and research excellence. The multi-disciplinary faculty of behavioral scientists and clinicians is committed to providing state-of-the-art care in their quest to assist children, adolescents and their families.   The NYU Child Study Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, and the Rockland Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center (RCPC) offer a unique combination of comprehensive clinical facilities serving diverse patient populations. Residents gain clinical experience at Bellevue on the Child Inpatient Service (the first in the United States); the Adolescent Inpatient Service (also the first in the country); the Adolescent Day Hospital; the Pediatric Emergency Service; Public School 35M (one of the first public school programs established in a hospital); the Child and Adolescent Mental Hygiene Clinic (which includes a Therapeutic Nursery/Preschool); and the Pediatric Consultation-Liaison Service. At NYU there are clinical opportunities at Tisch Hospital's inpatient Young Adult Program; pediatric consultation liaison activities at Tisch Hospital, Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, and Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders; and the varied components of the NYU Child Study Center. First year child residents also rotate at RCPC, an intensive, family-based inpatient program, where they learn to psychiatrically diagnose and treat some of the most troubled and disruptive children in the state.   This comprehensive didactic/supervisory program offers year-long seminars on child and adolescent development and psychopathology as well as two years of psychopharmacology; continuous case seminars (by members of the NYU Psychoanalytic Institute) and seminars in assessment; research; treatment modalities; forensics; ethics; substance abuse; and other related child and adolescent mental health issues. NYU Child Study Center holds one of the few weekly grand rounds in child and adolescent psychiatry in the country. At these presentations residents hear from national experts each week and then meet with the speaker for lunch immediately afterwards, providing more opportunities for learning, mentorship, and future collaboration.   The Family Studies Program, in collaboration with the Ackerman Institute of Family Therapy, offers a first-year didactic seminar and two years of weekly live family therapy supervision. Second-year residents also have weekly group and cognitive behavior therapy supervision. Individual long-term therapy supervision is provided throughout the two years along with individual supervision by attending on clinical rotations.   The Department has one of seven federally funded Research Units for Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP). Residents are welcome to participate in ongoing research through RUPP or the many other ongoing research studies at the NYU Child Study Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, or RCPC.
