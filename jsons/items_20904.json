NOPREN is a multidisciplinary, comprehensive research center that coordinates, develops, and disseminates evidence-based multilevel policy recommendations to address nutrition and obesity prevention for racial and ethnic minorities in urban settings.      NOPREN unites NYU and its community and government partners to conduct research and evaluation projects to inform policy development. NOPREN partners are preparing a cohesive set of policy recommendations building on existing research on nutrition and obesity prevention in New York City and State. By evaluating existing policies with a focus on racial and ethnic minorities, NOPREN tailors its recommendations to improve the availability and accessibility of healthy food in diverse communities.      NOPREN is led by Dr. Brian Elbel and Courtney Abrams, in conjunction with academic partners at the NYU School of Medicine, College of Nursing, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, and the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.           \u00a0         Evaluation of a Large-Scale Drinking Water Availability Intervention in NYC Schools      New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is conducting a large-scale intervention to increase drinking water availability in elementary, middle and high schools. They are installing and promoting \u201cwater jets\u201d which provide free, cool, filtered NYC tap water to students in the cafeteria. Schools were recruited to participate in this study, including elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. Half of the schools received a water jet and half did not. Data were collected through direct observation of cafeterias, student surveys, and staff interviews, before and after water jets were installed in participating schools. Factors measured include implementation processes, utilization of installed water dispensers, student water consumption, student perceptions of drinking water, and student consumption of other beverages such as sugary drinks and milk both during and outside of school hours. This project is a collaborative evaluation conducted by DOHMH and New York University School of Medicine, with technical support and guidance provided by content experts from CDC\u2019s Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity. Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under cooperative agreement number 1-U48-DP-001904-01.         Role of Calorie Labeling in Food and Restaurant Choices      Calorie labeling on fast food restaurant menus has shown limited effectiveness on altering food choices, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities residing in low-income communities. Reasons for why this policy has not been successful among these populations must be explored. We are examining the factors behind food choices and how they relate to calorie labeling by assessing the following:       Structural reasons: noticing, understanding of, and ability to fully utilize calorie labels as currently presented       Decision-making factors: the role that calorie information plays in the customers\u2019 food choices.      We are conducting focus group meetings and key informant interviews. In addition to exploring the influence of calorie labeling on food choices, we collect information on background factors, such as education level and risk for obesity. Lastly, we utilize the focus group results to provide greater insight into the potential effectiveness of policies meant to combat obesity. The information is being collected in four boroughs in New York City: the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under cooperative agreement number 1-U48-DP-001904-01.         NYC Adopt-A-Bodega Evaluation      In low-income, predominantly minority areas of NYC, small corner stores (known as bodegas) are often the most prevalent local source of food, but often offer less variety of fresh fruits and vegetables than larger food venues. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of a nutritional and community advocacy training intervention on purchases made in select bodegas located near elementary schools in the South Bronx. We have partnered with a community organization, Bronx Health REACH (BHR), which has conducted series of nutrition education programs for parents of students in elementary schools. They then implemented an \"Adopt a Bodega\" program modeled after the NYC DOHMH program under the same name, and provided parents with the tools to make corner stores located close to the schools healthier. Parents at the schools receive training to make sustainable changes within bodegas; we analyze the results at these and additional school-bodega pairs which act as control sites. We are particularly interested in seeing if the changes that result from the Adopt a Bodega advocacy training has an impact on food purchases made by the general public. Street-intercept surveys are administered to consumers before and after the intervention to examine the impact, if any, that the intervention had on foods purchased in the selected corner stores.
