About Ming Zeng   Ming Zeng, L.Ac., has been a medical doctor since 1982, practicing both Chinese and Western medicine. She has been practicing traditional Chinese medicine for more than 25 years, with more than a decade of experience in the U.S. Her practice includes Chinese acupuncture and Chinese herbology. \"Dr. Ming,\" as she is fondly called by her patients, is a licensed acupuncturist in the state of New York and has a long and distinguished medical career. Prior to coming to New York in 1996, she was the Director and Chief Attending Physician of the Department of Internal Medicine at Beijing Capital International Airport Hospital, one of China's most distinguished medical facilities.   Services   Dr. Ming sees patients on a regular basis at the CSTP where she complements the Western medical treatments by offering a variety of traditional Chinese treatments to alleviate pain. At the CSTP, Dr. Ming offers acupuncture, herbal medicine, and other services.   Acupuncture   Acupuncture is one of the keystones of traditional Chinese medicine. The oldest medical textbook in the world, from more than 4,000 years ago, describes acupuncture and the theory behind it.   The fundamental theory of traditional Chinese medicine says that there is an energy force flowing throughout the body. This force, known as Qi (pronounced \u201cchee\u201d), comprises all of the essential aspects of life\u2014physical, emotional, and spiritual. Qi flows through various channels throughout the body. When the flow of Qi is impeded, illness\u00a0can result.   Acupuncturists use nine types of sterile disposable needles of varying lengths. There are a number of precise techniques used by acupuncturists for inserting the needles. Points can be needled at different angles relative to the skin surface. The acupuncturist can insert the needle using various motions or combinations of motions, including thrusting, plucking, and vibration techniques. Depending upon the therapy and treatment, heated herbs may be applied to the needle or electricity may be used to stimulate the points through the needle.   Chinese Herbal Medicine   Chinese Herbal Medicine is part of the ancient healing art of traditional Chinese medicine. Chinese herbs are used to restore the Qi by bringing into balance the opposing forces of Yin and Yang. Through 5,000 years of research and natural selection, combinations of herbs have been identified that are effective in restoring the balance between Yin and Yang under many conditions. The result, according to traditional Chinese medicine, is a return of the flow of Qi throughout the body and an improvement in physical and mental health.   The most common methods of applying herb therapies are through tePhoto Herbs Groupas and pills. The teas are strong and simmer for about one hour to gain potency. Herbs may also be dispensed through tablets, capsules, and powders. Dr. Ming designs specific, customized herbal treatments for her patients. When necessary, she brews the teas herself. Following her consultation and diagnosis, Dr. Ming may recommend a course of treatment using herbs alone or in conjunction with acupuncture.
