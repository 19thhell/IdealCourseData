Students will critique both scientific journal articles and corresponding popular press articles, discussing the strengths and weakness of each article. Topics of discussion will include: How are the innovations in the field of neuroscience communicated to the public? What details are edited and filtered out when communicating neuroscience to the public? What is the right balance for communicating research and should limitations be included? What findings are typically highlighted in popular media and why? Students will also discuss the impact of neuroscience research on shaping government policy. and contemporary publications in the field.            Development and Dysfunction of the Nervous System  NEURL-UA 305  Prerequisites: NEURL-UA 100 (Intro to Neuro) and NEURL-UA 210 (Cell & Molec NB), or permission of the instructor  Instructor: Sanes  Semester: Spring  4 points     This course will explore how the nervous system develops in normal animals, and how genetic and epigenetic factors can disrupt these processes. Lectures on normal developmental mechanisms will be interleaved with those on disorders to provide a solid foundation for our discussions of abnormal events during maturation. The lectures on normal development cover a broad range of topics including differentiation, axon outgrowth, synapse formation, specificity of connections, and plasticity. The lectures on dysfunction include autism, dyslexia, mental retardation, specific language impairment, hearing loss, blindness, ADHD, demyelinating or neurodegenerative disorders, and axon regeneration. The major goals of the course will be to understand the extent to which current theories can explain the etiology of each disorder, and to learn how basic research can best facilitate advances in our knowledge and, ultimately, lead to treatments or cures.

Students will analyze scientific research papers and discuss the dissemination of results to the general public. Students will be assigned a scientific article in the field of neuroscience to present to the class. Students will critique both scientific journal articles and corresponding popular press articles, discussing the strengths and weakness of each article. Topics of discussion will include: How are the innovations in the field of neuroscience communicated to the public? What details are edited and filtered out when communicating neuroscience to the public? What is the right balance for communicating research and should limitations be included? What findings are typically highlighted in popular media and why? Students will also discuss the impact of neuroscience research on shaping government policy. and contemporary publications in the field.            Development and Dysfunction of the Nervous System  NEURL-UA 305  Prerequisites: NEURL-UA 100 (Intro to Neuro) and NEURL-UA 210 (Cell & Molec NB), or permission of the instructor  Instructor: Sanes  Semester: Spring  4 points     This course will explore how the nervous system develops in normal animals, and how genetic and epigenetic factors can disrupt these processes. Lectures on normal developmental mechanisms will be interleaved with those on disorders to provide a solid foundation for our discussions of abnormal events during maturation. The lectures on normal development cover a broad range of topics including differentiation, axon outgrowth, synapse formation, specificity of connections, and plasticity. The lectures on dysfunction include autism, dyslexia, mental retardation, specific language impairment, hearing loss, blindness, ADHD, demyelinating or neurodegenerative disorders, and axon regeneration. The major goals of the course will be to understand the extent to which current theories can explain the etiology of each disorder, and to learn how basic research can best facilitate advances in our knowledge and, ultimately, lead to treatments or cures.
