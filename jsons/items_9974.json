Focuses on the comparative study of empires from the Romans to the present and on the variety of ways in which empire-states have established and constrained claims to rights, belonging, and power. The study of empire expands our debates over rights, citizenship, economic regulation, and accountability without letting them fall into a seeming gap between the nation-state and the global.    Political Cultures of Empire HIST-GA 2861 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15.

Medieval Europe    Literature of the Field: Middle Ages HIST-GA 2113 4 points. 2014-15. This course provides an introduction to the literature of medieval history for the period c. 1050-1400, as that literature has evolved over the last century, with a focus on changes in the methodology of medieval historiography, the approach to primary texts and the shifting interests that have characterized medieval scholarship in the modern context.    Byzantium and the West HIST-GA 1156 4 points. 2013-14.

With an astonishingly long life span, extending from Antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages in the Byzantine East, the Roman Empire left a legacy of political and legal organization that has shaped the modern world. This seminar explores, on the one hand, the representation and exercise of imperial power and, on the other, the way the emperor's subjects perceived their position within the system and experienced authority, official or not. We will investigate imperial legitimacy building, political discourse, consensus and opposition, negotiation and concessions to the powerful, local government and justice, corruption, oppression and patronage, as well as the social groupings and networks that afforded some leverage to the less powerful.    Europe    Literature of the Field: Early Modern Europe HIST-GA 1150 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Surveys major literature and historiographical issues in the early modern field.

European Intellectual History HIST-GA 1193 4 points. 2014-15. Interplays the specific cultural-historical context of interwar Europe (in particular France in the late Third Republic and Weimar Germany, but also to a lesser extent Austria, Italy, and early Soviet Russia) with trends of philosophical, literary, and political writing of the period. Certain themes or figures guide the choice of texts, e.g., authority, subjectivity, violence, sovereignty.    The Mediterranean in Historical Perspective HIST-GA 3901 4 points. 2014-15. This course will focus on war and civil war in the twentieth-century Mediterranean. We will compare and contrast the experiences of Spain, Greece and Italy, as well as of other countries of Southern Europe, and analyze how the legacy of civil war has contributed to shaping contemporary national identities. This course will address major methodological questions concerning how we understand war and civil war in the fields of history and social sciences. We will also discuss the peculiarity, if any, of civil wars in the Mediterranean, in relation to the wider historical context of twentieth-century Europe.    Italian Colonialism and Postcolonialism HIST-GA 2972 4 points. 2014-15. Explores Italian colonialism from the late 19th century through the end of empire. Through readings of travel literature, films, and historical works, we address the meaning of colonialism within Italian history and culture, colonial racial policies and gender identities, and the legacies of colonialism in Italy and in its former colonies.    Russian Cultural History HIST-GA 1330 4 points. 2014-15. This course looks at \"culture\" in an expansive way, examining recent scholarship on mapping, settlement, and territorial expansion, on laws and courts, on empire and religion, love and power, property and markets, gender, family, friendship, social science and art in Russia from the 17th through the 20th century. We will look at different groups in the empire's population--peasants in imperial and post-Soviet times, nobles, one empress and her advisor/lover, Muslims, various nationalities, Soviet officials, workers, and youth and at the linkages among them and to the state.    The Ottoman 17th Century HIST-GA 3503 4 points. 2013-14. The course emphasizes religious and intellectual over political developments, although the continuing importance of patronage as a cultural and political dynamic is stressed as a process linking all these domains. It also aims at highlighting varied communal and social experiences as well as inter-communal relations over imperial or state-oriented policies and programs.    The Ottoman Empire in Europe HIST-GA.1651 4 points. 2013-14.    The Politics of Language in Early Modern and Modern Italy HIST-GA 1981 4 points. 2014-15.    Modern European Cities HIST-GA 1203 4 points. 2014-15. This colloquium examines recent scholarship in European urban history. It includes cities from Barcelona to Moscow, and ranges widely over the 19th and 20th centuries, but its ultimate goal is not to \"cover\" particular cities or themes so much as to introduce major works and approaches from the previous decade. What issues are energizing European urban history? How do these issues relate to broader developments in historiography and the humanities? In what ways does urban history contribute something distinctive to these conversations?    19th Century France HIST-GA 1209 4 points. 2014-15. Explores the transformation of France from the Old Regime monarchy of the late eighteenth century to the early Third Republic of the 1870s. We will focus first on the French Revolution, its origins, dynamics and consequences. We will then study the political, social, and cultural conflicts that help explain why the French went through three more revolutions--in 1830, 1848, and 1871--before establishing a stable form of republican government. We will also devote time to social and cultural history, and especially to recent literature on working-class formation, gender relations, and the peasantry.    History of Modern Ireland HIST-GA.1416 2013-14.    Latin America and the Caribbean    Literature of the Field: Colonial Latin America HIST-GA 1200 4 points. 2012-13.

It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.    Transnational Approaches to US History HIST-GA 1739 4 points. 2014-15. This course will explore recent developments in historiography that seek ways of understanding a national history\u2014U.S. History in this case\u2014in a framework larger than the nation. There are different transnational framings, different in type and scale, but Diasporas and Borderlands, Atlantic World, and Global are at present the most vigorous, and the focus will be mainly on them.    Black New York HIST-GA 2551 4 points. 2014-15. This course will explore the under-engaged topic of blacks in New York from its Dutch origins to the present. The process of racial formation and the mechanisms of racial domination in the early stages of the settlement were central to the northern colonial experience and to the founding of the United States.    Race, Civil War, and Reconstruction HIST-GA 1607 4 points. 2013-14. This is a course about the social, cultural, intellectual, and political history of the United States in the long nineteenth century, illuminated through the lens of the war that punctuated and transformed that century. With race at the center of our inquiries, we will proceed both chronologically and thematically, reading and evaluating some of the newest and most influential scholarship in an effort to formulate our own arguments, both individual and collective, about the era.    World History/Transnational Approaches    Methods and Approaches to World History HIST-GA 2168 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15.    Environmental History HIST-GA 1050 4 points. 2013-14.

Theorizing Race and Slavery HIST-GA 2901 4 points. 2014-15.    Women and the Book HIST-GA 1119 4 points. 2014-15. This course examines the cultural worlds of medieval women through particular attention to the books that they owned, commissioned, and created. Beginning with the earliest Christian centuries, the course proceeds chronologically through the fourteenth century. In addition to examining specific manuscripts, we will consider ancillary questions to do with women's authorship, education and literacy, reading patterns, devotional practices, and visual traditions and representation. Considering both lay and religious women, the course addresses the sorts of books owned by individual women and the types of books they produced.    Gender and Sexuality in African American History HIST-GA 2622 4 points. 2013-14. This course will highlight how and why analyzing gender and sexuality is critical to understanding African American history. From slavery to freedom, reform and leisure, community and conflict, the personal and the public, we will discuss major themes, phenomena, demographic shifts, and social movements.
