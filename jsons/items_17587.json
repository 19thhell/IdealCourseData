Grade Requirements   The Institute requires a 2.0 GPA in all courses and specifies other general requirements in the section &ldquo;Undergraduate Academic Programs and Policies,&rdquo; beginning on page 16 of the School of Engineering catalog which describes the core curriculum for all engineering majors, including placement procedures in writing, mathematics and programming; course credits by transfer and advanced placement; and credit by examination.   To graduate with a BS in Computer Engineering, you must:   1) Have a C-grade or better in:   4.00 Credits Introduction to Programming & Problem Solving CS-UY 1114 This course introduces problem solving and computer programming and is for undergraduate Computer Science and Computer Engineering majors who have limited prior experience in programming in any language. The course covers fundamentals of computer programming and its underlying principles using the Python programming language. Concepts and methods introduced in the course are illustrated by examples from various disciplines. ABET competencies: a,b,c, e, f, g, k Corequisite: EX-UY 1 4.00 Credits Object Oriented Programming CS-UY 1124 This intermediate-level programming course teaches object-oriented programming in C++. Topics: Pointers, dynamic memory allocation and recursion. Classes and objects including constructors, destructors, methods (member functions) and data members. Access and the interface to relationships of classes including composition, association and inheritance. Polymorphism through function overloading operators. Inheritance and templates. The standard template library is used to introduce elementary data structures and their use. Grade of C- or better required of computer science and computer engineering majors. Prerequisite: CS-UY 1114 (C- or better) or CS-UY 1133 (A- or better). ABET competencies: c, e, k. Corequisite: EX-UY 1 4.00 Credits Data Structures and Algorithms CS-UY 2134 This course covers abstract data types and the implementation and use of standard data structures. Topics: Fundamental algorithms and the basics of algorithm analysis. A grade of C- or better is required of undergraduate computer science and computer-engineering majors. Prerequisites: CS-UY 1124 (C- or better) and MA-UY 1024. ABET competencies: a, b, c, e. 4.00 Credits Digital Logic and State Machine Design CS-UY 2204 This course covers combinational and sequential digital circuits.

ABET competencies a, b, c, d, e, k.   2) Have a technical GPA of 2.0 based on all courses prefixed EE, CS or EL. Seniors may elect graduate courses labeled EL 5XX3, but not CS 5XX3. To enroll in other graduate courses, you must meet required department GPA standards and adviser approval.   Senior Design Project   The 2-semester Senior Design Project allows you to focus on an application of computer engineering. In the first semester, you and your classmates will concentrate on hardware and/or software. You will develop skills using specialized laboratory equipment and computer-design packages and will be introduced to techniques for planning projects and making effective presentations. You will learn to balance design requirements such as performance, safety, reliability, and cost effectiveness.   In the second and final semester, you will design, build or simulate, and test a device or system to meet prescribed engineering specifications.   Senior Thesis   If as an undergraduate computer engineering student you wish to do a Senior Thesis (BS thesis) instead of Design Project (DP), you must:     Complete 6 total credits of EE 397   Complete EE 4001   Make a presentation to your thesis adviser, with attendance open to other students and faculty; and   Bind your thesis according to Institute guidelines for MS and PhD theses.     Note: For the thesis, you do need not register for Design Project I or Design Project II. Before registering for Senior Thesis, you must find a faculty member to serve as thesis adviser. In addition, you must have a 3.0 GPA in order to register for Senior Thesis instead of Design Project.   Additional notes:     The Senior Thesis must be design oriented   The 6 credits of DP-1 and DP-2 are replaced by 6 credits of Senior Thesis (EE 397)   You are advised not to take all 6 credits of Senior Thesis during a single semester     Senior Honors Students   Each spring, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering selects senior honors students with high GPAs who will complete their degree requirements in the following academic year. Such students are listed as honor students in that year&rsquo;s commencement program and are given special permission to substitute courses in their senior year. Most often these students substitute more advanced graduate courses in place of usual requirements in the same study area. Transfer students are eligible for this designation after they complete half of the credits needed to satisfy the School of Engineering degree requirements (e.g., 64 of 128 total credits).
