The event will feature three moderated panels, which will present a multifaceted view of the legislation, challenges to its constitutionality, and its implications for individuals and health care service providers. The first panel, &#8220;Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Constitutional?&#8221; will explore the constitutional arguments for and against the Act as the Supreme Court prepares to hold oral argument on these issues. The second panel, &#8220;State and Federal Health Care Implementation Strategies,&#8221; will explore the various methods for implementation of health care reform by federal and state administrations. Finally, the third panel, &#8220;Economic and Business Implications of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,&#8221; will examine the ways in which the Act might improve, harm, or alter the delivery of health services to insurance beneficiaries, affect the health of the population, and change the business of healthcare providers.
