How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence. Promised: By the end of the class, you will have been able to  comprehend this course description. Prepare to be reset! Topics in Film &amp; Literatue: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel,  Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the  cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary  films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our  other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship between  documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography,  cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist,  indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in  the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other  uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics  are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and  into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment  archive or in an archive of your choice.    Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

Call for Papers Workshop: Dissecting Society. Periodical Literature and Social Observation (1830-1850) CIRHUS, New York University, 20th of March 2015 Between 1830 and 1850, on a rapidly expanding print market, a vast amount of short literary pieces on cultural manners, social types and societal developments appeared in the European press and beyond. These \u201cprotosociological sketches\u201c (M. Lauster) or \u201cpanoramic literature\u201c (W. Benjamin) were published in the periodical press as well as in serial collections frequently illustrated with engravings. Assembling an extensive array of urban and rural types, these literary and visual sketches, commissioned to writers, aimed at constructing a total view of a city or of a nation, and were later to appear in compilations such as Paris, ou le livre des cent-et-un, Heads of the People or Los espa\u00f1oles pintados por s\u00ed mismos, to name just a few. In trying to reveal outer appearances and inner logics of their period, these sketches reflect on concepts such as \u201cculture\u201d, \u201csociety\u201d and \u201cnation\u201d. Even though there has been a considerable amount of studies about \u201cpanoramic literature\u201c in terms of literary criticism, its alliances with the emerging humanities and social sciences has rarely been studied. This workshop aims at stimulating an interdisciplinary and transnational approach to this literary corpus, in order to reconsider it vis-\u00e0-vis the emergence of the social sciences. The workshop will be held on the 20th of March 2015 at the Center for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences at New York University. It will bring together researchers from any discipline related to panoramic literature (and its visual production) as early forms of sociological observation within a history of knowledge. Comprised of 15-20 minutes presentations integrated into panels, the workshop will provide an opportunity to exchange ideas, to advance work in progress and nourish new collaborations. We encourage the submission of papers, especially of those sharing work in progress. Topics covered may include: - Delimiting \u201cproto-sociological\u201c or \u201cpanoramic\u201c literature in an interdisciplinary perspective: borders, overlaps, modes of definition (e.g. interdependencies with statistical, economic or antiquarian works, with urban portrait and reportage, political journalism, or travel literature) - Recurrent lines of discourse of social observation (social classes and money as structuring features, the rise of \u201cnew\u201c values, new technologies, declining customs and professions). - Conditions of reception: readership and social/political impact of the sketches - National/regional differences and interregional/transnational circulations/ adaptations of sociological knowledge - Text-image relationships in relation to emerging forms of sociological and ethnographical representation. - Epistemology: scientific currents and the adaptation of patterns of knowledge (zoology, botany, medicine, physiology, physiognomy, biology\u2026) - Evaluations of societal questions and ideologies - The city as context and content of social observation, institutions of knowledge, and the rise of social science Please send your abstract by November 30, 2014 (400 words maximum) to christiane.schwab@hu-berlin.de. The conference language will be English. You will be notified about your participation by December 10. We will ask the participants to submit a readable draft of their presentation by March 1. We will then distribute these papers among the rest of the participants.             Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence. Promised: By the end of the class, you will have been able to  comprehend this course description. Prepare to be reset! Topics in Film &amp; Literatue: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel,  Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the  cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary  films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our  other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship between  documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography,  cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist,  indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in  the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other  uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics  are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and  into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment  archive or in an archive of your choice.    Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

Call for Papers Workshop: Dissecting Society. Periodical Literature and Social Observation (1830-1850) CIRHUS, New York University, 20th of March 2015 Between 1830 and 1850, on a rapidly expanding print market, a vast amount of short literary pieces on cultural manners, social types and societal developments appeared in the European press and beyond. These \u201cprotosociological sketches\u201c (M. Lauster) or \u201cpanoramic literature\u201c (W. Benjamin) were published in the periodical press as well as in serial collections frequently illustrated with engravings. Assembling an extensive array of urban and rural types, these literary and visual sketches, commissioned to writers, aimed at constructing a total view of a city or of a nation, and were later to appear in compilations such as Paris, ou le livre des cent-et-un, Heads of the People or Los espa\u00f1oles pintados por s\u00ed mismos, to name just a few. In trying to reveal outer appearances and inner logics of their period, these sketches reflect on concepts such as \u201cculture\u201d, \u201csociety\u201d and \u201cnation\u201d. Even though there has been a considerable amount of studies about \u201cpanoramic literature\u201c in terms of literary criticism, its alliances with the emerging humanities and social sciences has rarely been studied. This workshop aims at stimulating an interdisciplinary and transnational approach to this literary corpus, in order to reconsider it vis-\u00e0-vis the emergence of the social sciences. The workshop will be held on the 20th of March 2015 at the Center for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences at New York University. It will bring together researchers from any discipline related to panoramic literature (and its visual production) as early forms of sociological observation within a history of knowledge. Comprised of 15-20 minutes presentations integrated into panels, the workshop will provide an opportunity to exchange ideas, to advance work in progress and nourish new collaborations. We encourage the submission of papers, especially of those sharing work in progress. Topics covered may include: - Delimiting \u201cproto-sociological\u201c or \u201cpanoramic\u201c literature in an interdisciplinary perspective: borders, overlaps, modes of definition (e.g. interdependencies with statistical, economic or antiquarian works, with urban portrait and reportage, political journalism, or travel literature) - Recurrent lines of discourse of social observation (social classes and money as structuring features, the rise of \u201cnew\u201c values, new technologies, declining customs and professions). - Conditions of reception: readership and social/political impact of the sketches - National/regional differences and interregional/transnational circulations/ adaptations of sociological knowledge - Text-image relationships in relation to emerging forms of sociological and ethnographical representation. - Epistemology: scientific currents and the adaptation of patterns of knowledge (zoology, botany, medicine, physiology, physiognomy, biology\u2026) - Evaluations of societal questions and ideologies - The city as context and content of social observation, institutions of knowledge, and the rise of social science Please send your abstract by November 30, 2014 (400 words maximum) to christiane.schwab@hu-berlin.de. The conference language will be English. You will be notified about your participation by December 10. We will ask the participants to submit a readable draft of their presentation by March 1. We will then distribute these papers among the rest of the participants.             Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
