The Center does this by promoting collaboration among those FAS departments and programs which focus, in whole or in part, on antiquity and its reception in the modern world. These include Ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian Studies , Anthropology , Art History , Classics , Comparative Literature , English , Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies , Philosophy , Religious Studies , the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies , and the Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies . The Center also collaborates with NYU units outside of FAS, such as NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts and the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World .    The Center builds on rich resources both on and off the NYU campus. NYU\u2019s Bobst Library, for example, has significant holdings on antiquity including papyri and manuscripts, and is also a partner institution in the Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS) . The University also has a collection of ancient art and inscriptions. Finally, a number of scholarly organizations relevant to antiquity are based at the Center, including the American section of the Institute for Etruscan and Italic Studies , the Aquila Theatre Company , and the professional journal Etruscan News . In addition, the Center also benefits from colleagues and connections at leading institutions in the city, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the American Numismatic Society, and the New York Public Library, to name just a few.    The Center\u2019s activities include: interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as an undergraduate minor in Ancient Studies; scholarly lectures and workshops, including annual Lewent Conferences and Ranieri Colloquia; research and travel grants for students; occasional visiting scholars; and summer seminars for college faculty from across the United States (in collaboration with the Faculty Resource Network). The Center also produces occasional publications.    The Center was established with generous funding from two NYU alumni: Salvatore Ranieri (B.A. '70) endowed the Angelo J. Ranieri Directorship in Ancient Studies and the Antonina S. Ranieri International Scholars Fund; Rose-Marie Lewent (B.A. '45) endowed the annual Lewent Conference in Ancient Studies.

Also, the inscriptions, while not yet fully published, can be accessed via the internet through the US Epigraphy Project .    Library Resources    Together, Bobst Library and the Institute of Fine Art s have extensive holdings of books, journals, and online resources covering all aspects of antiquity. The libraries offer access to standard journal collections such as JSTOR, and participate in cooperative digitizing projects such as the Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS). The holdings of NYU\u2019s libraries are particularly strong in archaeology, papyrology, and primary sources.

The Center does this by promoting collaboration among those FAS departments and programs which focus, in whole or in part, on antiquity and its reception in the modern world. These include Ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian Studies , Anthropology , Art History , Classics , Comparative Literature , English , Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies , Philosophy , Religious Studies , the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies , and the Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies . The Center also collaborates with NYU units outside of FAS, such as NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts and the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World .    The Center builds on rich resources both on and off the NYU campus. NYU\u2019s Bobst Library, for example, has significant holdings on antiquity including papyri and manuscripts, and is also a partner institution in the Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS) . The University also has a collection of ancient art and inscriptions. Finally, a number of scholarly organizations relevant to antiquity are based at the Center, including the American section of the Institute for Etruscan and Italic Studies , the Aquila Theatre Company , and the professional journal Etruscan News . In addition, the Center also benefits from colleagues and connections at leading institutions in the city, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the American Numismatic Society, and the New York Public Library, to name just a few.    The Center\u2019s activities include: interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as an undergraduate minor in Ancient Studies; scholarly lectures and workshops, including annual Lewent Conferences and Ranieri Colloquia; research and travel grants for students; occasional visiting scholars; and summer seminars for college faculty from across the United States (in collaboration with the Faculty Resource Network). The Center also produces occasional publications.    The Center was established with generous funding from two NYU alumni: Salvatore Ranieri (B.A. '70) endowed the Angelo J. Ranieri Directorship in Ancient Studies and the Antonina S. Ranieri International Scholars Fund; Rose-Marie Lewent (B.A. '45) endowed the annual Lewent Conference in Ancient Studies.    The Center's Director is Matthew S. Santirocco , Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Professor of Classics.                        &copy;    NEW YORK UNIVERSITY      CREATED BY NYU, FACULTY OF ARTS AND SCIENCE, OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS"}, {"content": "Faculty | Center for Ancient Studies | NYU                             NEW YORK UNIVERSITY              ARTS AND SCIENCE              COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE              GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE                                  CONTACT US SEARCH SITEMAP                     Home &gt; Faculty                     About The Center       Events     Faculty Who Work on Antiquity and Related Subjects at NYU     Ancient Studies Minor       Travel Grants       Collections       NYU Excavations       Publications       Classical World       Institute for Etruscan and Italic Studies       Aquila Theatre Company       Faculty Who Work on Antiquity and Related Subjects at NYU      Matthew Adams (Institute of Fine Arts) Egyptian archaeology, urbanism and social complexity; the nature and evolution of sacred landscapes  Roger Bagnall (Director, Institute for the Study of the Ancient World) Greek and Roman history; papyrology; late antiquity  Alessandro Barchiesi (Visiting Professor, Classics) Roman poetry and poetics, literary history, narrative fiction; reception of Classical studies; Greek influence at Rome    Adam Becker (Religious Studies, Classics) Jewish-Christian relations in late antiquity; Syriac language and literature; reception of classical antiquity    Brigitte Bedos-Rezak (History) Medieval northern France; medieval semiotics; social history    Thomas O.
