[{"detail": [{"content": "NYU paper            Reasoning about   thought &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Draft February 2004    Jane Heal      1. Introduction       Davidson proposed in &#145;On Saying That&#146; an account of   indirect discourse in which the idea that it involved indexicality   played a central role. (Davidson 1968) He took seriously the idea   that the &#145;that&#146; of indirect discourse might be indexical   and took it to be a referring demonstrative, picking out the token   sentence or utterance which followed. His proposal provoked much   discussion and many objections. In its original form I suspect that   it would have few defenders today. But the idea that there is some   kind of indexicality in indirect discourse, seems attractive. And if   the indexicality is not referential, then the sensible thing seems to   be the try the idea that it might be predicatival. Can we make sense   of the idea that there are indexical predicates? I suggest that we   can. (Heal 1997) And if this is right, can we apply the idea to   illuminate what is going on in reports of speech and thought? Again I   suggest that the answer is yes. Calling on the idea of indexical   predication we can articulate an account of indirect discourse which   has the advantages of Davidson&#146;s but escapes many of the   objections to his theory. (Heal 2001, 2003)      But there are loose ends. The reformulated account has not been   shown to escape all the objections levelled at Davidson&#146;s   theory. One such objection provides the focus of this paper. It is   due to Burge (1986) and it concerns the formal validity of inferences   like this:      (A) &#9;Galileo said that the Earth moves    so    Galileo said that the Earth moves.      Davidson&#146;s approach, says Burge, cannot make sense of the   fact that this inference is formally valid, and we shall see that   Burge is right. But, given this, a plausible line of argument   suggests that a reformulated indexical account, calling on the idea   of indexical predication, might also be vulnerable to the same   charge, or rather to a suitably modified version of it. I hope to   show that, in the end, this line of argument fails. But seeing why   this is so involves disentangling some points of interest, concerning   thought and its indexical representation.      2. Indexical predication &#151; a brief outline       Before turning to Burge&#146;s observation and considering its   ramifications, I shall set the scene by sketching some of the central   ideas about indexical predication and how it might apply in the realm   of our thought about meaning and the psychological. (Readers are   referred to the earlier mentioned papers for a fuller account.)      Consider utterances of this form:      (1) My curtains are coloured thus {specimen of red material}      or      (2) Mary sang thus {a singing by me of Pop Goes the Weasel}.      What is the role here of &#145;thus&#146; and what follows it? The   complete vehicle of communication here is formed by some words,   including the indexical &#145;thus&#146;, together with a complement   provided by a specimen or performance of some kind. But the specimen   or performance is not itself referred to in the remark. So (3) is   importantly different, in logical and epistemological ways, from      (3) My curtains are the same colour as this piece of material   {specimen of red material}.      And (2) is similarly different from (4)      (4) Mary did some singing qualitatively similar to this {a singing   by me of Pop Goes the Weasel}.      Nevertheless the role of the specimen or performance in (1) and   (2) is crucial. It is there to make available for predicatival   attribution the predicate correlate (the property &#151; colour,   manner, action or whatever) which the remark as a whole ascribes to   the subject &#151; my curtains or Mary in the examples above. It   makes it available by instantiating it in the context of the   utterance and so making &#145;thus&#146; able to latch on to it. This   is the hallmark of indexical predication.      We can also say      (5) My curtains are this colour {specimen of red material}      or      (6) Mary sang this {a singing by me of Pop Goes the Weasel}.      The shift from &#145;thus&#146; to &#145;this&#146; marks our   willingness to think in terms of colours or tunes and to represent   what curtains or people do as having some relation to these   (non-concrete, non-particular) entities. Some will take it that what   we have here is indexical identification of a &#145;universal&#146;   &#151; or at least of some entity of that broad, non-concrete,   category. Nominalists would not happy with that and would seek to   explain away the locutions. Many familiar philosophical puzzlements   arise at this point. My purpose in mentioning them here is only to   set them on one side. For our purposes the important thing is the   similarity of (1), (2), (5) and (6) and their difference from (3) and   (4). The indexicality of (1), (2), (5) and (6), however exactly we   unpack it in metaphysical terms, has to do with characterising my   curtains or Mary, i.e. has to do with saying how they stand vis a vis   universals and other related abstract entities (if such exist). And   so for our purposes (1), (2), (5) and (6) are all indexical   predications.      Indexical predication is a useful resource when the vocabulary of   our language does not provide standard non-indexical words for the   property (colour, manner, action, or whatever) we wish to ascribe,   but where we do have, or can at will produce, specimen of it.   Indexical predication will be particularly useful in enabling us to   talk and think about intricate human performances, as for example in   music, where we have a know-how of producing them but lack explicit   analytic vocabulary for specifying all the important differences of   which are implicitly aware. Suppose, for example, I am familiar with   the tune Pop Goes the Weasel and can sing it but do not know its name   and cannot give an analytic musical description of it. In that case   (2) or (6) is the obvious resource for conveying to you what Mary   did.      Talking and thinking provide other example of such intricate human   performances. Hence the suggestion that we can and standardly do   represent them using the resources of indexical predication. So we   should see      (7) Galileo said that the Earth moves      as an indexical predication which attributes to Galileo a   performance the semantic character of which is made available to the   hearer by his or her appreciating the semantic character of the   complement clause. So we could represent its structure in this way      (8) Galileo said that {a saying by me that the Earth moves}.      As with Davidson&#146;s proposal, what occurs in the complement   clause is present in order to support and engage with an indexical,   in such way as to complete the whole claim, to fix its truth   conditions, appropriately. But the indexical is predicatival and not   referential (at least, no reference to a particular is involved).   Hence we avoid many of the objections to which Davidson&#146;s   account is open.      An implication of this construal of the linguistic structure of   (7) is an indexical reading of the structure of the thought which (7)   expresses. It is obvious that one who understands (7), whether   speaker of hearer, must at least exercise in combination his or her   concepts of Galileo and of saying and of some indexical concept. This   much is what is involved in understanding the first three words of   the sentence. But what of the later words? The indexical account of   indirect speech stresses that the words in the complement clause play   the same role there as they do when unembedded. So what is involved   in understanding them runs parallel to what is involved in   understanding &#145;Galileo&#146; or &#145;said&#146;, namely both   speaker and hearer exercise (in combination) their concepts of the   Earth and of moving. What ties the whole lot together, so asto   constitute a representation in thought of Galileo&#146;s action, is   that the thinking of &#145;the Earth moves&#146; is itself picked out   by the indexical concept expressed by &#145;that&#146; and so gets to   contribute to the truth conditions of the whole. This thinking of   &#145;the Earth moves&#146; instantiates and so makes available for   indexical attribution, the semantic properties of the performance   which it is the purpose of the whole thought to attribute to Galileo.         This general idea of an indexical structure in representation of   items with semantic properties can clearly also be applied when what   I am talking or thinking about is someone else&#146;s thoughts rather   than her speech. So if I think the thought expressed by      (9) Mary believes that the Earth moves      what I do is exercise my concepts of Mary and believing together   with some indexical, and then complement this by exercising my   concepts of the Earth and movement. So my thinking has roughly this   structure:      (10) Mary believes this {a thinking by me that the Earth moves}.      3. Indirect speech and formal validity: a problem for   Davidson&#146;s account      Let us now turn to Burge&#146;s argument. As we have already   reminded ourselves. Davidson&#146;s proposal is that indirect speech   is indexical, but the indexicality is of the familiar referential   kind. So for him &#145;Galileo said that the Earth moves&#146; claims   the existence of a relation (here represented by the verb   &#145;said&#146;) between Galileo and a particular utterance produced   by me, which is the referent of the indexical referring term   &#145;that&#146;. (Davidson himself gives a vivid informal   characterisation of the logical form he is trying to get us to grasp   by using the notion of samesaying. What I do, he suggests, is refer   to an utterance of mine and claim that some utterance of   Galileo&#146;s samesaid it. Compare the form of (3) or (4) above.)         Let us now look again at the argument (A).      (A) &#9;Galileo said that the Earth moves    so    Galileo said that the Earth moves.      We seem to have here an indubitable specimen of a formally valid   inference, the deduction of a claim from itself. On Davidson&#146;s   account of indirect speech, however, (A) has the same form as      (B) &#9;That cat {Tabitha} is friendly    &#9;so    &#9;That cat {Tibbles} is friendly.      Now even if Tabitha and Tibbles are both friendly, this clearly   does not make (B) into a formally valid argument. But on   Davidson&#146;s construal of indirect discourse (A) can be no better   than (B). This is because, according to him the two &#145;that&#146;s   of the premise and conclusion refer to two different particular   utterances of mine, say U1 and U2. And, just as Tabitha&#146;s   friendliness cannot logically guarantee the existence and   friendliness Tibbles, the fact that Galileo &#145;said&#146; U1 (in   Davidson&#146;s sense of &#145;said&#146;) cannot logically guarantee   the existence of U2 and his &#145;saying&#146; of it. To put this   another way, the fact that I do produce two specimens of &#145;the   Earth moves&#146;, and that each does in fact have the same content   as some remark of Galileo&#146;s, so that Galileo can be truly   reported as &#145;saying&#146; each, no more makes (A) formally valid   than the existence and friendliness of both Tabitha and Tibbles make   (B) formally valid.      It does not help if we suppose that it is somehow obvious from the   appearance of Tabitha and Tibbles that they are twins and share the   same temperament. The inference (B) may, if this extra information is   included as a premise, look more respectable. But our task is to   explain why (A) is formally valid just as it stands. To show that,   regarded as an enthymeme, the inference can be seen as valid does not   address the point.      This is in effect the objection Burge brings against Davidson.   Does a shift to indexical predication produce an account which   escapes any version of this difficulty? It looks at first glance as   if it might, because the shift allows us to say that the indexicals   in premise and conclusion serve to identify the same property. Hence,   it seems, we can say that premise and conclusion serve to make the   same claim about Galileo, unlike Davidson&#146;s account where they   make different claims. And so we seem to have saved the formal   validity.      But things are not so simple. Let us return to referential   indexicals and note that things are not guaranteed to improve, even   if we take cases where the indexically identified particular is the   same in premise and conclusion &#151; and hence where, in some sense   of &#145;same claim&#146;, premise and conclusion make the same   claim. Consider      (C) &#9;That cat {Tabitha} is friendly    &#9;So    &#9;That cat {Tabitha} is friendly.      Is this formally valid? It is not. Imagine that I direct the   premise at Tabitha&#146;s tail as she stands behind a broad pillar   and I direct the conclusion at the head of a cat (Tabitha as it   happens) protruding at the other side. Although I do in fact pick out   the same cat, I am not entitled without contingent information about   spatio-temporal continuity to the assumption that she is the same.   (The pillar is broad enough, let us suppose to allow for two curving   cat-width tunnels behind. So, for all I can see, it could be   Tabitha&#146;s tail on one side and Tibbles&#146; head on the other.)   I am not entitled to the inference. But then the inference can hardly   be formally valid.      Now consider      (D)&#9;The brooch is this shape {specimen of complicated shape}    &#9;so    &#9;The brooch is this shape {specimen of same shape but upside down}.      This inference suffers from the same defect as (C), namely that I   am not justified in endorsing it merely in virtue of the actual   identity of the shape picked out, together with my understanding of   the indexicals. I need, in addition, to be able to take for granted   that the same shape is identified in premise and conclusion. But it   is clear that, in this sort of case, I might understand both premise   and conclusion perfectly well without grasping this identity.      Consider also      (E) &#9;The brooch is this shape {specimen of complicated shape}    &#9;so         The brooch is this shape {specimen of different shape which,   however, gives the same impression as the first}.            What (C), (D) and (E) enable us to see is that, lurking behind   Burge&#146;s original problem of the different referents of the two   &#145;that&#146;s in (A) (on Davidson&#146;s construal of (A)) is   another problem for indexical accounts, namely that posed by the fact   of the two indexicals themselves. With an indexical, whether   referential or predicatival, mere sameness of semantic correlate   (whether a particular or a universal) does not secure the sort of   sameness in the nature of the grasp on that correlate, which entitles   a thinker to assume identity and hence to judge the inference   formally valid. Also, as (C) and (E) show, there is a converse   problem, namely that impression of sameness of semantic correlate can   sometimes be erroneous. So are there circumstances in which the user   of two different indexicals can be entitled to the assumption that   the semantic correlate is the same? And if so what are they? I cannot   offer a fully general answer to this question. But I think we can   answer it in the case of thought.      4. The Solution &#151; Purity of thought       Our problem is to explain why and how (A) differs from (D) and   (E). Two ideas provide the key to a solution. The first is the   &#145;purity&#146; of the indexicality involved and the second is the   right of a thinker to assume his or her competence in maintaining   stable concepts and deploying them in a logically well-structured   manner.      &#145;Pure&#146; indexicals (in the sense introduced by Kaplan)   are to be contrasted with demonstrative indexicals. An indexical type   is demonstrative if a token of it may need a demonstration of some   element in a perceptually presented array to fix whatit latches onto.   Some referential and predicatival indexicals are demonstrative. For   example, &#145;that cat&#146; may need to be supplemented by a   pointing to one of a group of cats to determine its referent. Or   &#145;that shape&#146; may need supplementation by an indication of   one shape among various ones exhibited in the environment.      But the rules governing some referential indexicals mean that such   demonstrative support is in their case not necessary. If the rule for   the indexical type, the rule which links any token to its referent in   the context, is so set up that there can be only one possible   contender to be that referent then further demonstrative information,   even if it can be provided, is not necessary. For example a token of   &#145;I&#146; can only refer to whoever produced it. This does not   mean that the referent is something it is not possible to perceive or   to demonstrate. (I may point to myself as well as uttering   &#145;I&#146;, but I do not need to do so.) The point is only that   securing of reference need not go via such perception and   demonstration.      Can predicatival indexicals also be pure, in this sense? The   conditions on the well-formedness of thoughts show that it is.   Consider to start with the subject slot. If I am to be credited with   making a judgement of the form &#145;---- said that the Earth   moves&#146;, then it must be determinate which conceptual content is   playing the role of subject vis a vis the concept of the action   &#145;said&#146;. I have not succeeded in making any judgement unless   there is one and only one such content playing that role. The content   could itself be complex, as in &#145;the first notable European   scientist to be offered a chair at Harvard&#146; or &#145;either   Galileo or Newton&#146; or &#145;both Galileo and Newton&#146; and so   on. But if it is indeterminate what content is there, then the   psychological goings on in me (whatever their subjective character)   do not constitute my making a well-formed judgement.      Similar observations apply with respect to what I judge Galileo to   have said. It is a condition of the thought&#146;s being well-formed   that there be only one content-supplying thought in the indexically   indicated complement slot. Of course that thought may itself be   complex, in being disjunctive, quantificational and so forth. But   unless there is one and only one thought occupying the complement   place, and hence available to be latched on to by the indexical, the   psychological goings on do not constitute my making any well-formed   judgement about what Galileo said.      Now of course I can wonder about many people, whether they said   that the Earth moves. Similarly I can wonder about many claims   whether Galileo made them. But these observations must not lead us to   suppose that making a judgement involves some kind of inner pointing,   whereby one concept rather than another gets to be put in the subject   slot or the complement slot of a judgement. What resolves my   uncertainty about who said what are thought processes in which I look   at evidence and ponder its force. The upshot of such investigations,   if helpful evidence comes to hand, is that I come to see (what I take   to be) the truth on the issues. While investigating I deploy my   concepts in various ways. The inveestigating, if successful,   terminates in their being assembled in my mind in one determinate   way, namely that which constitutes my making the judgement which the   investigation leads me to. We must not complicate matters by   supposing that even when I have done the investigating and come to a   conclusion, I still have to do some inner pointing in order to get my   concepts in the right relations to constitute my (really) making the   judgement. To think this way is to embark on an absurd infinite   regress.      So, for exemple, suppose that I am wondering what Galileo said on   a particular occasion. It is my appreciation of the evidence about   the astronomical claim he then made which ends up by putting one and   only one determinate content in the complement slot of my thought   &#145;Galileo said &#133;&#146;. There is no role here to be played   by any inner analogue of demonstration. Hence, to repeat, the   indexical can latch on to this embedded thought without the need of a   quasi-demonstration to distinguish that thought from others. Perhaps   thoughts can also be &#145;introspected&#146; and quasi-demonstrated.   But we do not have to take any stand on this issue to help ourselves   to the idea that the complement-indentifying indexicals may be   pure.      So (A) differs from (D) in that the indexical invoked in (A) is   pure. But by itself this does not solve our problem of showing how   someone could be entitled to (A), i.e. to assume that the conclusion   is merely the repetition of the premise and hence that we have formal   validity. Someone might object: &#145;How can you be assured that the   second indexically used token &#151; the one in the conclusion   &quot;Galileo said that the Earth moves&quot; &#151; latches on to   the same content as the first token &#151; the one in the premise   &quot;Galileo said that the Earth moves&quot;? I allow that both   indexicals are pure&#146; says this objector &#145;but might it not   be the case that, unknown to you, the two complement thoughts are not   tokens of the same type?&#146;      With pure indexical reference we can resist this kind of move, at   least in some cases, by pointing out that premise and conclusion are   judged or enunciated at the same place and time and by the same   person. Hence a reasoner is entitled to assume the same referent for   tokens of &#145;I&#146;, &#145;here&#146; and &#145;now&#146; which   are deployed in that way.      We can also resist worries about identity of worldly correlate,   for demonstrative indexicals, by making one identification serve for   both premise and conclusion. In effect, I make an anaphoric link   between premise and conclusion. Thus I might fix my eye on a cat and   think &#145;that cat is friendly, so it is friendly&#146;. Here I do   not risk unnoticed substitution of one cat for another because I use   the same perception and demonstration to identify the cat in both   premise and conclusion. Analogously, on the predicatival front, I   might reason: &#145;That is the shape of the brooch, so it is the   shape of the brooch&#146; &#151; using one look at the shape to fix   which shape I meant.      But it is not plausible that (A) has this last mentioned form. So   let us grant that in it there are two tokens of &#145;the Earth   moves&#146;, one fixing the content of Galileo&#146;s saying for the   premise and one for the conclusion, just as there are two exercises   of my concept of Galileo, one for the premise and one for the   conclusion. In this situation, why am I entitled to assume that I am   do not make a mistake analogous to that of the reasoner in (E), who   wrongly assumes the identity of two shapes which look the same? The   objector may reinforce the worry by pointing out that sentences may   be subtly ambiguous. Failure to detect such ambiguity, and hence   mistaken apprehensions of formal validity, are a well known source of   fallacious reasoning. I may think I am having the same thought   aroused in my by contemplating the complement in premise and   conclusion, but perhaps this is a mistaken impression.      The worry is perfectly proper one. But what has been raised is an   entirely general difficulty which arises in formulating any theory of   our entitlement to confidence in formal validity. It bears as much on   my right to think to suppose that it is Galileo about whom I think in   premise and conclusion as upon my right to take it that it is his   thought about the Earth which is reported. And radical scepticism   about the stability of our concepts is not something we are required   to answer here. The idea of detecting and responding to formally   valid inference presupposes an intact mind, entitled to the general   presupposition that it can hold its ideas steady and respond   appropriately to identities of concepts. Such a mind is entitled to   the assumption that it can hold the indexically used specimen steady   as well as the frame in which itappears.         References       Burge, T.

Introduction       Davidson proposed in &#145;On Saying That&#146; an account of   indirect discourse in which the idea that it involved indexicality   played a central role. (Davidson 1968) He took seriously the idea   that the &#145;that&#146; of indirect discourse might be indexical   and took it to be a referring demonstrative, picking out the token   sentence or utterance which followed. His proposal provoked much   discussion and many objections. In its original form I suspect that   it would have few defenders today. But the idea that there is some   kind of indexicality in indirect discourse, seems attractive. And if   the indexicality is not referential, then the sensible thing seems to   be the try the idea that it might be predicatival. Can we make sense   of the idea that there are indexical predicates? I suggest that we   can. (Heal 1997) And if this is right, can we apply the idea to   illuminate what is going on in reports of speech and thought? Again I   suggest that the answer is yes. Calling on the idea of indexical   predication we can articulate an account of indirect discourse which   has the advantages of Davidson&#146;s but escapes many of the   objections to his theory. (Heal 2001, 2003)      But there are loose ends. The reformulated account has not been   shown to escape all the objections levelled at Davidson&#146;s   theory. One such objection provides the focus of this paper. It is   due to Burge (1986) and it concerns the formal validity of inferences   like this:      (A) &#9;Galileo said that the Earth moves    so    Galileo said that the Earth moves.      Davidson&#146;s approach, says Burge, cannot make sense of the   fact that this inference is formally valid, and we shall see that   Burge is right. But, given this, a plausible line of argument   suggests that a reformulated indexical account, calling on the idea   of indexical predication, might also be vulnerable to the same   charge, or rather to a suitably modified version of it. I hope to   show that, in the end, this line of argument fails. But seeing why   this is so involves disentangling some points of interest, concerning   thought and its indexical representation.      2. Indexical predication &#151; a brief outline       Before turning to Burge&#146;s observation and considering its   ramifications, I shall set the scene by sketching some of the central   ideas about indexical predication and how it might apply in the realm   of our thought about meaning and the psychological. (Readers are   referred to the earlier mentioned papers for a fuller account.)      Consider utterances of this form:      (1) My curtains are coloured thus {specimen of red material}      or      (2) Mary sang thus {a singing by me of Pop Goes the Weasel}.      What is the role here of &#145;thus&#146; and what follows it? The   complete vehicle of communication here is formed by some words,   including the indexical &#145;thus&#146;, together with a complement   provided by a specimen or performance of some kind. But the specimen   or performance is not itself referred to in the remark. So (3) is   importantly different, in logical and epistemological ways, from      (3) My curtains are the same colour as this piece of material   {specimen of red material}.      And (2) is similarly different from (4)      (4) Mary did some singing qualitatively similar to this {a singing   by me of Pop Goes the Weasel}.      Nevertheless the role of the specimen or performance in (1) and   (2) is crucial. It is there to make available for predicatival   attribution the predicate correlate (the property &#151; colour,   manner, action or whatever) which the remark as a whole ascribes to   the subject &#151; my curtains or Mary in the examples above. It   makes it available by instantiating it in the context of the   utterance and so making &#145;thus&#146; able to latch on to it. This   is the hallmark of indexical predication.      We can also say      (5) My curtains are this colour {specimen of red material}      or      (6) Mary sang this {a singing by me of Pop Goes the Weasel}.      The shift from &#145;thus&#146; to &#145;this&#146; marks our   willingness to think in terms of colours or tunes and to represent   what curtains or people do as having some relation to these   (non-concrete, non-particular) entities. Some will take it that what   we have here is indexical identification of a &#145;universal&#146;   &#151; or at least of some entity of that broad, non-concrete,   category. Nominalists would not happy with that and would seek to   explain away the locutions. Many familiar philosophical puzzlements   arise at this point. My purpose in mentioning them here is only to   set them on one side. For our purposes the important thing is the   similarity of (1), (2), (5) and (6) and their difference from (3) and   (4). The indexicality of (1), (2), (5) and (6), however exactly we   unpack it in metaphysical terms, has to do with characterising my   curtains or Mary, i.e. has to do with saying how they stand vis a vis   universals and other related abstract entities (if such exist). And   so for our purposes (1), (2), (5) and (6) are all indexical   predications.      Indexical predication is a useful resource when the vocabulary of   our language does not provide standard non-indexical words for the   property (colour, manner, action, or whatever) we wish to ascribe,   but where we do have, or can at will produce, specimen of it.   Indexical predication will be particularly useful in enabling us to   talk and think about intricate human performances, as for example in   music, where we have a know-how of producing them but lack explicit   analytic vocabulary for specifying all the important differences of   which are implicitly aware. Suppose, for example, I am familiar with   the tune Pop Goes the Weasel and can sing it but do not know its name   and cannot give an analytic musical description of it. In that case   (2) or (6) is the obvious resource for conveying to you what Mary   did.      Talking and thinking provide other example of such intricate human   performances. Hence the suggestion that we can and standardly do   represent them using the resources of indexical predication. So we   should see      (7) Galileo said that the Earth moves      as an indexical predication which attributes to Galileo a   performance the semantic character of which is made available to the   hearer by his or her appreciating the semantic character of the   complement clause. So we could represent its structure in this way      (8) Galileo said that {a saying by me that the Earth moves}.      As with Davidson&#146;s proposal, what occurs in the complement   clause is present in order to support and engage with an indexical,   in such way as to complete the whole claim, to fix its truth   conditions, appropriately. But the indexical is predicatival and not   referential (at least, no reference to a particular is involved).   Hence we avoid many of the objections to which Davidson&#146;s   account is open.      An implication of this construal of the linguistic structure of   (7) is an indexical reading of the structure of the thought which (7)   expresses. It is obvious that one who understands (7), whether   speaker of hearer, must at least exercise in combination his or her   concepts of Galileo and of saying and of some indexical concept. This   much is what is involved in understanding the first three words of   the sentence. But what of the later words? The indexical account of   indirect speech stresses that the words in the complement clause play   the same role there as they do when unembedded. So what is involved   in understanding them runs parallel to what is involved in   understanding &#145;Galileo&#146; or &#145;said&#146;, namely both   speaker and hearer exercise (in combination) their concepts of the   Earth and of moving. What ties the whole lot together, so asto   constitute a representation in thought of Galileo&#146;s action, is   that the thinking of &#145;the Earth moves&#146; is itself picked out   by the indexical concept expressed by &#145;that&#146; and so gets to   contribute to the truth conditions of the whole. This thinking of   &#145;the Earth moves&#146; instantiates and so makes available for   indexical attribution, the semantic properties of the performance   which it is the purpose of the whole thought to attribute to Galileo.         This general idea of an indexical structure in representation of   items with semantic properties can clearly also be applied when what   I am talking or thinking about is someone else&#146;s thoughts rather   than her speech. So if I think the thought expressed by      (9) Mary believes that the Earth moves      what I do is exercise my concepts of Mary and believing together   with some indexical, and then complement this by exercising my   concepts of the Earth and movement. So my thinking has roughly this   structure:      (10) Mary believes this {a thinking by me that the Earth moves}.      3. Indirect speech and formal validity: a problem for   Davidson&#146;s account      Let us now turn to Burge&#146;s argument. As we have already   reminded ourselves. Davidson&#146;s proposal is that indirect speech   is indexical, but the indexicality is of the familiar referential   kind. So for him &#145;Galileo said that the Earth moves&#146; claims   the existence of a relation (here represented by the verb   &#145;said&#146;) between Galileo and a particular utterance produced   by me, which is the referent of the indexical referring term   &#145;that&#146;. (Davidson himself gives a vivid informal   characterisation of the logical form he is trying to get us to grasp   by using the notion of samesaying. What I do, he suggests, is refer   to an utterance of mine and claim that some utterance of   Galileo&#146;s samesaid it. Compare the form of (3) or (4) above.)         Let us now look again at the argument (A).      (A) &#9;Galileo said that the Earth moves    so    Galileo said that the Earth moves.      We seem to have here an indubitable specimen of a formally valid   inference, the deduction of a claim from itself. On Davidson&#146;s   account of indirect speech, however, (A) has the same form as      (B) &#9;That cat {Tabitha} is friendly    &#9;so    &#9;That cat {Tibbles} is friendly.      Now even if Tabitha and Tibbles are both friendly, this clearly   does not make (B) into a formally valid argument. But on   Davidson&#146;s construal of indirect discourse (A) can be no better   than (B). This is because, according to him the two &#145;that&#146;s   of the premise and conclusion refer to two different particular   utterances of mine, say U1 and U2. And, just as Tabitha&#146;s   friendliness cannot logically guarantee the existence and   friendliness Tibbles, the fact that Galileo &#145;said&#146; U1 (in   Davidson&#146;s sense of &#145;said&#146;) cannot logically guarantee   the existence of U2 and his &#145;saying&#146; of it. To put this   another way, the fact that I do produce two specimens of &#145;the   Earth moves&#146;, and that each does in fact have the same content   as some remark of Galileo&#146;s, so that Galileo can be truly   reported as &#145;saying&#146; each, no more makes (A) formally valid   than the existence and friendliness of both Tabitha and Tibbles make   (B) formally valid.      It does not help if we suppose that it is somehow obvious from the   appearance of Tabitha and Tibbles that they are twins and share the   same temperament. The inference (B) may, if this extra information is   included as a premise, look more respectable. But our task is to   explain why (A) is formally valid just as it stands. To show that,   regarded as an enthymeme, the inference can be seen as valid does not   address the point.      This is in effect the objection Burge brings against Davidson.   Does a shift to indexical predication produce an account which   escapes any version of this difficulty? It looks at first glance as   if it might, because the shift allows us to say that the indexicals   in premise and conclusion serve to identify the same property. Hence,   it seems, we can say that premise and conclusion serve to make the   same claim about Galileo, unlike Davidson&#146;s account where they   make different claims. And so we seem to have saved the formal   validity.      But things are not so simple. Let us return to referential   indexicals and note that things are not guaranteed to improve, even   if we take cases where the indexically identified particular is the   same in premise and conclusion &#151; and hence where, in some sense   of &#145;same claim&#146;, premise and conclusion make the same   claim. Consider      (C) &#9;That cat {Tabitha} is friendly    &#9;So    &#9;That cat {Tabitha} is friendly.      Is this formally valid? It is not. Imagine that I direct the   premise at Tabitha&#146;s tail as she stands behind a broad pillar   and I direct the conclusion at the head of a cat (Tabitha as it   happens) protruding at the other side. Although I do in fact pick out   the same cat, I am not entitled without contingent information about   spatio-temporal continuity to the assumption that she is the same.   (The pillar is broad enough, let us suppose to allow for two curving   cat-width tunnels behind. So, for all I can see, it could be   Tabitha&#146;s tail on one side and Tibbles&#146; head on the other.)   I am not entitled to the inference. But then the inference can hardly   be formally valid.      Now consider      (D)&#9;The brooch is this shape {specimen of complicated shape}    &#9;so    &#9;The brooch is this shape {specimen of same shape but upside down}.      This inference suffers from the same defect as (C), namely that I   am not justified in endorsing it merely in virtue of the actual   identity of the shape picked out, together with my understanding of   the indexicals. I need, in addition, to be able to take for granted   that the same shape is identified in premise and conclusion. But it   is clear that, in this sort of case, I might understand both premise   and conclusion perfectly well without grasping this identity.      Consider also      (E) &#9;The brooch is this shape {specimen of complicated shape}    &#9;so         The brooch is this shape {specimen of different shape which,   however, gives the same impression as the first}.            What (C), (D) and (E) enable us to see is that, lurking behind   Burge&#146;s original problem of the different referents of the two   &#145;that&#146;s in (A) (on Davidson&#146;s construal of (A)) is   another problem for indexical accounts, namely that posed by the fact   of the two indexicals themselves. With an indexical, whether   referential or predicatival, mere sameness of semantic correlate   (whether a particular or a universal) does not secure the sort of   sameness in the nature of the grasp on that correlate, which entitles   a thinker to assume identity and hence to judge the inference   formally valid. Also, as (C) and (E) show, there is a converse   problem, namely that impression of sameness of semantic correlate can   sometimes be erroneous. So are there circumstances in which the user   of two different indexicals can be entitled to the assumption that   the semantic correlate is the same? And if so what are they? I cannot   offer a fully general answer to this question. But I think we can   answer it in the case of thought.      4. The Solution &#151; Purity of thought       Our problem is to explain why and how (A) differs from (D) and   (E). Two ideas provide the key to a solution. The first is the   &#145;purity&#146; of the indexicality involved and the second is the   right of a thinker to assume his or her competence in maintaining   stable concepts and deploying them in a logically well-structured   manner.      &#145;Pure&#146; indexicals (in the sense introduced by Kaplan)   are to be contrasted with demonstrative indexicals. An indexical type   is demonstrative if a token of it may need a demonstration of some   element in a perceptually presented array to fix whatit latches onto.   Some referential and predicatival indexicals are demonstrative. For   example, &#145;that cat&#146; may need to be supplemented by a   pointing to one of a group of cats to determine its referent. Or   &#145;that shape&#146; may need supplementation by an indication of   one shape among various ones exhibited in the environment.      But the rules governing some referential indexicals mean that such   demonstrative support is in their case not necessary. If the rule for   the indexical type, the rule which links any token to its referent in   the context, is so set up that there can be only one possible   contender to be that referent then further demonstrative information,   even if it can be provided, is not necessary. For example a token of   &#145;I&#146; can only refer to whoever produced it. This does not   mean that the referent is something it is not possible to perceive or   to demonstrate. (I may point to myself as well as uttering   &#145;I&#146;, but I do not need to do so.) The point is only that   securing of reference need not go via such perception and   demonstration.      Can predicatival indexicals also be pure, in this sense? The   conditions on the well-formedness of thoughts show that it is.   Consider to start with the subject slot. If I am to be credited with   making a judgement of the form &#145;---- said that the Earth   moves&#146;, then it must be determinate which conceptual content is   playing the role of subject vis a vis the concept of the action   &#145;said&#146;. I have not succeeded in making any judgement unless   there is one and only one such content playing that role. The content   could itself be complex, as in &#145;the first notable European   scientist to be offered a chair at Harvard&#146; or &#145;either   Galileo or Newton&#146; or &#145;both Galileo and Newton&#146; and so   on. But if it is indeterminate what content is there, then the   psychological goings on in me (whatever their subjective character)   do not constitute my making a well-formed judgement.      Similar observations apply with respect to what I judge Galileo to   have said. It is a condition of the thought&#146;s being well-formed   that there be only one content-supplying thought in the indexically   indicated complement slot. Of course that thought may itself be   complex, in being disjunctive, quantificational and so forth. But   unless there is one and only one thought occupying the complement   place, and hence available to be latched on to by the indexical, the   psychological goings on do not constitute my making any well-formed   judgement about what Galileo said.      Now of course I can wonder about many people, whether they said   that the Earth moves. Similarly I can wonder about many claims   whether Galileo made them. But these observations must not lead us to   suppose that making a judgement involves some kind of inner pointing,   whereby one concept rather than another gets to be put in the subject   slot or the complement slot of a judgement. What resolves my   uncertainty about who said what are thought processes in which I look   at evidence and ponder its force. The upshot of such investigations,   if helpful evidence comes to hand, is that I come to see (what I take   to be) the truth on the issues. While investigating I deploy my   concepts in various ways. The inveestigating, if successful,   terminates in their being assembled in my mind in one determinate   way, namely that which constitutes my making the judgement which the   investigation leads me to. We must not complicate matters by   supposing that even when I have done the investigating and come to a   conclusion, I still have to do some inner pointing in order to get my   concepts in the right relations to constitute my (really) making the   judgement. To think this way is to embark on an absurd infinite   regress.      So, for exemple, suppose that I am wondering what Galileo said on   a particular occasion. It is my appreciation of the evidence about   the astronomical claim he then made which ends up by putting one and   only one determinate content in the complement slot of my thought   &#145;Galileo said &#133;&#146;. There is no role here to be played   by any inner analogue of demonstration. Hence, to repeat, the   indexical can latch on to this embedded thought without the need of a   quasi-demonstration to distinguish that thought from others. Perhaps   thoughts can also be &#145;introspected&#146; and quasi-demonstrated.   But we do not have to take any stand on this issue to help ourselves   to the idea that the complement-indentifying indexicals may be   pure.      So (A) differs from (D) in that the indexical invoked in (A) is   pure. But by itself this does not solve our problem of showing how   someone could be entitled to (A), i.e. to assume that the conclusion   is merely the repetition of the premise and hence that we have formal   validity. Someone might object: &#145;How can you be assured that the   second indexically used token &#151; the one in the conclusion   &quot;Galileo said that the Earth moves&quot; &#151; latches on to   the same content as the first token &#151; the one in the premise   &quot;Galileo said that the Earth moves&quot;? I allow that both   indexicals are pure&#146; says this objector &#145;but might it not   be the case that, unknown to you, the two complement thoughts are not   tokens of the same type?&#146;      With pure indexical reference we can resist this kind of move, at   least in some cases, by pointing out that premise and conclusion are   judged or enunciated at the same place and time and by the same   person. Hence a reasoner is entitled to assume the same referent for   tokens of &#145;I&#146;, &#145;here&#146; and &#145;now&#146; which   are deployed in that way.      We can also resist worries about identity of worldly correlate,   for demonstrative indexicals, by making one identification serve for   both premise and conclusion. In effect, I make an anaphoric link   between premise and conclusion. Thus I might fix my eye on a cat and   think &#145;that cat is friendly, so it is friendly&#146;. Here I do   not risk unnoticed substitution of one cat for another because I use   the same perception and demonstration to identify the cat in both   premise and conclusion. Analogously, on the predicatival front, I   might reason: &#145;That is the shape of the brooch, so it is the   shape of the brooch&#146; &#151; using one look at the shape to fix   which shape I meant.      But it is not plausible that (A) has this last mentioned form. So   let us grant that in it there are two tokens of &#145;the Earth   moves&#146;, one fixing the content of Galileo&#146;s saying for the   premise and one for the conclusion, just as there are two exercises   of my concept of Galileo, one for the premise and one for the   conclusion. In this situation, why am I entitled to assume that I am   do not make a mistake analogous to that of the reasoner in (E), who   wrongly assumes the identity of two shapes which look the same? The   objector may reinforce the worry by pointing out that sentences may   be subtly ambiguous. Failure to detect such ambiguity, and hence   mistaken apprehensions of formal validity, are a well known source of   fallacious reasoning. I may think I am having the same thought   aroused in my by contemplating the complement in premise and   conclusion, but perhaps this is a mistaken impression.      The worry is perfectly proper one. But what has been raised is an   entirely general difficulty which arises in formulating any theory of   our entitlement to confidence in formal validity. It bears as much on   my right to think to suppose that it is Galileo about whom I think in   premise and conclusion as upon my right to take it that it is his   thought about the Earth which is reported. And radical scepticism   about the stability of our concepts is not something we are required   to answer here. The idea of detecting and responding to formally   valid inference presupposes an intact mind, entitled to the general   presupposition that it can hold its ideas steady and respond   appropriately to identities of concepts. Such a mind is entitled to   the assumption that it can hold the indexically used specimen steady   as well as the frame in which itappears.         References       Burge, T.

{"detail": [{"content": "NYU paper            Reasoning about   thought &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Draft February 2004    Jane Heal      1. Introduction       Davidson proposed in &#145;On Saying That&#146; an account of   indirect discourse in which the idea that it involved indexicality   played a central role. (Davidson 1968) He took seriously the idea   that the &#145;that&#146; of indirect discourse might be indexical   and took it to be a referring demonstrative, picking out the token   sentence or utterance which followed. His proposal provoked much   discussion and many objections. In its original form I suspect that   it would have few defenders today. But the idea that there is some   kind of indexicality in indirect discourse, seems attractive. And if   the indexicality is not referential, then the sensible thing seems to   be the try the idea that it might be predicatival. Can we make sense   of the idea that there are indexical predicates? I suggest that we   can. (Heal 1997) And if this is right, can we apply the idea to   illuminate what is going on in reports of speech and thought? Again I   suggest that the answer is yes. Calling on the idea of indexical   predication we can articulate an account of indirect discourse which   has the advantages of Davidson&#146;s but escapes many of the   objections to his theory. (Heal 2001, 2003)      But there are loose ends. The reformulated account has not been   shown to escape all the objections levelled at Davidson&#146;s   theory. One such objection provides the focus of this paper. It is   due to Burge (1986) and it concerns the formal validity of inferences   like this:      (A) &#9;Galileo said that the Earth moves    so    Galileo said that the Earth moves.      Davidson&#146;s approach, says Burge, cannot make sense of the   fact that this inference is formally valid, and we shall see that   Burge is right. But, given this, a plausible line of argument   suggests that a reformulated indexical account, calling on the idea   of indexical predication, might also be vulnerable to the same   charge, or rather to a suitably modified version of it. I hope to   show that, in the end, this line of argument fails. But seeing why   this is so involves disentangling some points of interest, concerning   thought and its indexical representation.      2. Indexical predication &#151; a brief outline       Before turning to Burge&#146;s observation and considering its   ramifications, I shall set the scene by sketching some of the central   ideas about indexical predication and how it might apply in the realm   of our thought about meaning and the psychological. (Readers are   referred to the earlier mentioned papers for a fuller account.)      Consider utterances of this form:      (1) My curtains are coloured thus {specimen of red material}      or      (2) Mary sang thus {a singing by me of Pop Goes the Weasel}.      What is the role here of &#145;thus&#146; and what follows it? The   complete vehicle of communication here is formed by some words,   including the indexical &#145;thus&#146;, together with a complement   provided by a specimen or performance of some kind. But the specimen   or performance is not itself referred to in the remark. So (3) is   importantly different, in logical and epistemological ways, from      (3) My curtains are the same colour as this piece of material   {specimen of red material}.      And (2) is similarly different from (4)      (4) Mary did some singing qualitatively similar to this {a singing   by me of Pop Goes the Weasel}.      Nevertheless the role of the specimen or performance in (1) and   (2) is crucial. It is there to make available for predicatival   attribution the predicate correlate (the property &#151; colour,   manner, action or whatever) which the remark as a whole ascribes to   the subject &#151; my curtains or Mary in the examples above. It   makes it available by instantiating it in the context of the   utterance and so making &#145;thus&#146; able to latch on to it. This   is the hallmark of indexical predication.      We can also say      (5) My curtains are this colour {specimen of red material}      or      (6) Mary sang this {a singing by me of Pop Goes the Weasel}.      The shift from &#145;thus&#146; to &#145;this&#146; marks our   willingness to think in terms of colours or tunes and to represent   what curtains or people do as having some relation to these   (non-concrete, non-particular) entities. Some will take it that what   we have here is indexical identification of a &#145;universal&#146;   &#151; or at least of some entity of that broad, non-concrete,   category. Nominalists would not happy with that and would seek to   explain away the locutions. Many familiar philosophical puzzlements   arise at this point. My purpose in mentioning them here is only to   set them on one side. For our purposes the important thing is the   similarity of (1), (2), (5) and (6) and their difference from (3) and   (4). The indexicality of (1), (2), (5) and (6), however exactly we   unpack it in metaphysical terms, has to do with characterising my   curtains or Mary, i.e. has to do with saying how they stand vis a vis   universals and other related abstract entities (if such exist). And   so for our purposes (1), (2), (5) and (6) are all indexical   predications.      Indexical predication is a useful resource when the vocabulary of   our language does not provide standard non-indexical words for the   property (colour, manner, action, or whatever) we wish to ascribe,   but where we do have, or can at will produce, specimen of it.   Indexical predication will be particularly useful in enabling us to   talk and think about intricate human performances, as for example in   music, where we have a know-how of producing them but lack explicit   analytic vocabulary for specifying all the important differences of   which are implicitly aware. Suppose, for example, I am familiar with   the tune Pop Goes the Weasel and can sing it but do not know its name   and cannot give an analytic musical description of it. In that case   (2) or (6) is the obvious resource for conveying to you what Mary   did.      Talking and thinking provide other example of such intricate human   performances. Hence the suggestion that we can and standardly do   represent them using the resources of indexical predication. So we   should see      (7) Galileo said that the Earth moves      as an indexical predication which attributes to Galileo a   performance the semantic character of which is made available to the   hearer by his or her appreciating the semantic character of the   complement clause. So we could represent its structure in this way      (8) Galileo said that {a saying by me that the Earth moves}.      As with Davidson&#146;s proposal, what occurs in the complement   clause is present in order to support and engage with an indexical,   in such way as to complete the whole claim, to fix its truth   conditions, appropriately. But the indexical is predicatival and not   referential (at least, no reference to a particular is involved).   Hence we avoid many of the objections to which Davidson&#146;s   account is open.      An implication of this construal of the linguistic structure of   (7) is an indexical reading of the structure of the thought which (7)   expresses. It is obvious that one who understands (7), whether   speaker of hearer, must at least exercise in combination his or her   concepts of Galileo and of saying and of some indexical concept. This   much is what is involved in understanding the first three words of   the sentence. But what of the later words? The indexical account of   indirect speech stresses that the words in the complement clause play   the same role there as they do when unembedded. So what is involved   in understanding them runs parallel to what is involved in   understanding &#145;Galileo&#146; or &#145;said&#146;, namely both   speaker and hearer exercise (in combination) their concepts of the   Earth and of moving. What ties the whole lot together, so asto   constitute a representation in thought of Galileo&#146;s action, is   that the thinking of &#145;the Earth moves&#146; is itself picked out   by the indexical concept expressed by &#145;that&#146; and so gets to   contribute to the truth conditions of the whole. This thinking of   &#145;the Earth moves&#146; instantiates and so makes available for   indexical attribution, the semantic properties of the performance   which it is the purpose of the whole thought to attribute to Galileo.         This general idea of an indexical structure in representation of   items with semantic properties can clearly also be applied when what   I am talking or thinking about is someone else&#146;s thoughts rather   than her speech. So if I think the thought expressed by      (9) Mary believes that the Earth moves      what I do is exercise my concepts of Mary and believing together   with some indexical, and then complement this by exercising my   concepts of the Earth and movement. So my thinking has roughly this   structure:      (10) Mary believes this {a thinking by me that the Earth moves}.      3. Indirect speech and formal validity: a problem for   Davidson&#146;s account      Let us now turn to Burge&#146;s argument. As we have already   reminded ourselves. Davidson&#146;s proposal is that indirect speech   is indexical, but the indexicality is of the familiar referential   kind. So for him &#145;Galileo said that the Earth moves&#146; claims   the existence of a relation (here represented by the verb   &#145;said&#146;) between Galileo and a particular utterance produced   by me, which is the referent of the indexical referring term   &#145;that&#146;. (Davidson himself gives a vivid informal   characterisation of the logical form he is trying to get us to grasp   by using the notion of samesaying. What I do, he suggests, is refer   to an utterance of mine and claim that some utterance of   Galileo&#146;s samesaid it. Compare the form of (3) or (4) above.)         Let us now look again at the argument (A).      (A) &#9;Galileo said that the Earth moves    so    Galileo said that the Earth moves.      We seem to have here an indubitable specimen of a formally valid   inference, the deduction of a claim from itself. On Davidson&#146;s   account of indirect speech, however, (A) has the same form as      (B) &#9;That cat {Tabitha} is friendly    &#9;so    &#9;That cat {Tibbles} is friendly.      Now even if Tabitha and Tibbles are both friendly, this clearly   does not make (B) into a formally valid argument. But on   Davidson&#146;s construal of indirect discourse (A) can be no better   than (B). This is because, according to him the two &#145;that&#146;s   of the premise and conclusion refer to two different particular   utterances of mine, say U1 and U2. And, just as Tabitha&#146;s   friendliness cannot logically guarantee the existence and   friendliness Tibbles, the fact that Galileo &#145;said&#146; U1 (in   Davidson&#146;s sense of &#145;said&#146;) cannot logically guarantee   the existence of U2 and his &#145;saying&#146; of it. To put this   another way, the fact that I do produce two specimens of &#145;the   Earth moves&#146;, and that each does in fact have the same content   as some remark of Galileo&#146;s, so that Galileo can be truly   reported as &#145;saying&#146; each, no more makes (A) formally valid   than the existence and friendliness of both Tabitha and Tibbles make   (B) formally valid.      It does not help if we suppose that it is somehow obvious from the   appearance of Tabitha and Tibbles that they are twins and share the   same temperament. The inference (B) may, if this extra information is   included as a premise, look more respectable. But our task is to   explain why (A) is formally valid just as it stands. To show that,   regarded as an enthymeme, the inference can be seen as valid does not   address the point.      This is in effect the objection Burge brings against Davidson.   Does a shift to indexical predication produce an account which   escapes any version of this difficulty? It looks at first glance as   if it might, because the shift allows us to say that the indexicals   in premise and conclusion serve to identify the same property. Hence,   it seems, we can say that premise and conclusion serve to make the   same claim about Galileo, unlike Davidson&#146;s account where they   make different claims. And so we seem to have saved the formal   validity.      But things are not so simple. Let us return to referential   indexicals and note that things are not guaranteed to improve, even   if we take cases where the indexically identified particular is the   same in premise and conclusion &#151; and hence where, in some sense   of &#145;same claim&#146;, premise and conclusion make the same   claim. Consider      (C) &#9;That cat {Tabitha} is friendly    &#9;So    &#9;That cat {Tabitha} is friendly.      Is this formally valid? It is not. Imagine that I direct the   premise at Tabitha&#146;s tail as she stands behind a broad pillar   and I direct the conclusion at the head of a cat (Tabitha as it   happens) protruding at the other side. Although I do in fact pick out   the same cat, I am not entitled without contingent information about   spatio-temporal continuity to the assumption that she is the same.   (The pillar is broad enough, let us suppose to allow for two curving   cat-width tunnels behind. So, for all I can see, it could be   Tabitha&#146;s tail on one side and Tibbles&#146; head on the other.)   I am not entitled to the inference. But then the inference can hardly   be formally valid.      Now consider      (D)&#9;The brooch is this shape {specimen of complicated shape}    &#9;so    &#9;The brooch is this shape {specimen of same shape but upside down}.      This inference suffers from the same defect as (C), namely that I   am not justified in endorsing it merely in virtue of the actual   identity of the shape picked out, together with my understanding of   the indexicals. I need, in addition, to be able to take for granted   that the same shape is identified in premise and conclusion. But it   is clear that, in this sort of case, I might understand both premise   and conclusion perfectly well without grasping this identity.      Consider also      (E) &#9;The brooch is this shape {specimen of complicated shape}    &#9;so         The brooch is this shape {specimen of different shape which,   however, gives the same impression as the first}.            What (C), (D) and (E) enable us to see is that, lurking behind   Burge&#146;s original problem of the different referents of the two   &#145;that&#146;s in (A) (on Davidson&#146;s construal of (A)) is   another problem for indexical accounts, namely that posed by the fact   of the two indexicals themselves. With an indexical, whether   referential or predicatival, mere sameness of semantic correlate   (whether a particular or a universal) does not secure the sort of   sameness in the nature of the grasp on that correlate, which entitles   a thinker to assume identity and hence to judge the inference   formally valid. Also, as (C) and (E) show, there is a converse   problem, namely that impression of sameness of semantic correlate can   sometimes be erroneous. So are there circumstances in which the user   of two different indexicals can be entitled to the assumption that   the semantic correlate is the same? And if so what are they? I cannot   offer a fully general answer to this question. But I think we can   answer it in the case of thought.      4. The Solution &#151; Purity of thought       Our problem is to explain why and how (A) differs from (D) and   (E). Two ideas provide the key to a solution. The first is the   &#145;purity&#146; of the indexicality involved and the second is the   right of a thinker to assume his or her competence in maintaining   stable concepts and deploying them in a logically well-structured   manner.      &#145;Pure&#146; indexicals (in the sense introduced by Kaplan)   are to be contrasted with demonstrative indexicals. An indexical type   is demonstrative if a token of it may need a demonstration of some   element in a perceptually presented array to fix whatit latches onto.   Some referential and predicatival indexicals are demonstrative. For   example, &#145;that cat&#146; may need to be supplemented by a   pointing to one of a group of cats to determine its referent. Or   &#145;that shape&#146; may need supplementation by an indication of   one shape among various ones exhibited in the environment.      But the rules governing some referential indexicals mean that such   demonstrative support is in their case not necessary. If the rule for   the indexical type, the rule which links any token to its referent in   the context, is so set up that there can be only one possible   contender to be that referent then further demonstrative information,   even if it can be provided, is not necessary. For example a token of   &#145;I&#146; can only refer to whoever produced it. This does not   mean that the referent is something it is not possible to perceive or   to demonstrate. (I may point to myself as well as uttering   &#145;I&#146;, but I do not need to do so.) The point is only that   securing of reference need not go via such perception and   demonstration.      Can predicatival indexicals also be pure, in this sense? The   conditions on the well-formedness of thoughts show that it is.   Consider to start with the subject slot. If I am to be credited with   making a judgement of the form &#145;---- said that the Earth   moves&#146;, then it must be determinate which conceptual content is   playing the role of subject vis a vis the concept of the action   &#145;said&#146;. I have not succeeded in making any judgement unless   there is one and only one such content playing that role. The content   could itself be complex, as in &#145;the first notable European   scientist to be offered a chair at Harvard&#146; or &#145;either   Galileo or Newton&#146; or &#145;both Galileo and Newton&#146; and so   on. But if it is indeterminate what content is there, then the   psychological goings on in me (whatever their subjective character)   do not constitute my making a well-formed judgement.      Similar observations apply with respect to what I judge Galileo to   have said. It is a condition of the thought&#146;s being well-formed   that there be only one content-supplying thought in the indexically   indicated complement slot. Of course that thought may itself be   complex, in being disjunctive, quantificational and so forth. But   unless there is one and only one thought occupying the complement   place, and hence available to be latched on to by the indexical, the   psychological goings on do not constitute my making any well-formed   judgement about what Galileo said.      Now of course I can wonder about many people, whether they said   that the Earth moves. Similarly I can wonder about many claims   whether Galileo made them. But these observations must not lead us to   suppose that making a judgement involves some kind of inner pointing,   whereby one concept rather than another gets to be put in the subject   slot or the complement slot of a judgement. What resolves my   uncertainty about who said what are thought processes in which I look   at evidence and ponder its force. The upshot of such investigations,   if helpful evidence comes to hand, is that I come to see (what I take   to be) the truth on the issues. While investigating I deploy my   concepts in various ways. The inveestigating, if successful,   terminates in their being assembled in my mind in one determinate   way, namely that which constitutes my making the judgement which the   investigation leads me to. We must not complicate matters by   supposing that even when I have done the investigating and come to a   conclusion, I still have to do some inner pointing in order to get my   concepts in the right relations to constitute my (really) making the   judgement. To think this way is to embark on an absurd infinite   regress.      So, for exemple, suppose that I am wondering what Galileo said on   a particular occasion. It is my appreciation of the evidence about   the astronomical claim he then made which ends up by putting one and   only one determinate content in the complement slot of my thought   &#145;Galileo said &#133;&#146;. There is no role here to be played   by any inner analogue of demonstration. Hence, to repeat, the   indexical can latch on to this embedded thought without the need of a   quasi-demonstration to distinguish that thought from others. Perhaps   thoughts can also be &#145;introspected&#146; and quasi-demonstrated.   But we do not have to take any stand on this issue to help ourselves   to the idea that the complement-indentifying indexicals may be   pure.      So (A) differs from (D) in that the indexical invoked in (A) is   pure. But by itself this does not solve our problem of showing how   someone could be entitled to (A), i.e. to assume that the conclusion   is merely the repetition of the premise and hence that we have formal   validity. Someone might object: &#145;How can you be assured that the   second indexically used token &#151; the one in the conclusion   &quot;Galileo said that the Earth moves&quot; &#151; latches on to   the same content as the first token &#151; the one in the premise   &quot;Galileo said that the Earth moves&quot;? I allow that both   indexicals are pure&#146; says this objector &#145;but might it not   be the case that, unknown to you, the two complement thoughts are not   tokens of the same type?&#146;      With pure indexical reference we can resist this kind of move, at   least in some cases, by pointing out that premise and conclusion are   judged or enunciated at the same place and time and by the same   person. Hence a reasoner is entitled to assume the same referent for   tokens of &#145;I&#146;, &#145;here&#146; and &#145;now&#146; which   are deployed in that way.      We can also resist worries about identity of worldly correlate,   for demonstrative indexicals, by making one identification serve for   both premise and conclusion. In effect, I make an anaphoric link   between premise and conclusion. Thus I might fix my eye on a cat and   think &#145;that cat is friendly, so it is friendly&#146;. Here I do   not risk unnoticed substitution of one cat for another because I use   the same perception and demonstration to identify the cat in both   premise and conclusion. Analogously, on the predicatival front, I   might reason: &#145;That is the shape of the brooch, so it is the   shape of the brooch&#146; &#151; using one look at the shape to fix   which shape I meant.      But it is not plausible that (A) has this last mentioned form. So   let us grant that in it there are two tokens of &#145;the Earth   moves&#146;, one fixing the content of Galileo&#146;s saying for the   premise and one for the conclusion, just as there are two exercises   of my concept of Galileo, one for the premise and one for the   conclusion. In this situation, why am I entitled to assume that I am   do not make a mistake analogous to that of the reasoner in (E), who   wrongly assumes the identity of two shapes which look the same? The   objector may reinforce the worry by pointing out that sentences may   be subtly ambiguous. Failure to detect such ambiguity, and hence   mistaken apprehensions of formal validity, are a well known source of   fallacious reasoning. I may think I am having the same thought   aroused in my by contemplating the complement in premise and   conclusion, but perhaps this is a mistaken impression.      The worry is perfectly proper one. But what has been raised is an   entirely general difficulty which arises in formulating any theory of   our entitlement to confidence in formal validity. It bears as much on   my right to think to suppose that it is Galileo about whom I think in   premise and conclusion as upon my right to take it that it is his   thought about the Earth which is reported. And radical scepticism   about the stability of our concepts is not something we are required   to answer here. The idea of detecting and responding to formally   valid inference presupposes an intact mind, entitled to the general   presupposition that it can hold its ideas steady and respond   appropriately to identities of concepts. Such a mind is entitled to   the assumption that it can hold the indexically used specimen steady   as well as the frame in which itappears.         References       Burge, T.

The semester will be punctuated by (1) major cultural/political developments and controversies: the founding of the Abbey Theatre; the decline of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy; the 1916 Rising; the Troubles in the North (2) dominant literary figures: Yeats, Joyce, Beckett, and (3) ubiquitous themes: the idea of blood sacrifice as a liberation narrative; the fraught place of the Irish language; the persistent mythic, cultural, and literary trope of woman-as-nation?an image bound up with Ireland\u2019s colonial history. In additions to plays, novels, poems, short stories, and essays, we will read manifestos, pamphlets, reviews, debates in newspapers, and contemporary critical interventions, and we will think about texts in the context of the nation's turbulent history of colonial trauma, the complex path to independence, and the challenges of globalization. Course readings will also include essays that investigate such issues as nationalism, gender, myth, sexuality, religion, and postcolonialism.           Engl.GA.1085    Greg Londe (cross-listed with Irish Studies)    Beckett and His Contexts    Monday 6:10 - 8:40 PM      In this seminar we will read most of Beckett\u2019s body of work \u2013 his novels, plays, poems, and essays \u2013 and explore wide-ranging points of contact and comparison that emerge across his long career: disaffected son of Dublin, expatriate amanuensis to Joyce, translator of the black diaspora in Nancy Cunard\u2019s Negro Anthology , inheritor and apotheosis of Franco-Irish interchanges, key theorist of the mid-century\u2019s tragicomic negativity, cartographer of devastated landscapes from post-Famine Ireland to post-War France to post-Katrina New Orleans. Our study of Beckett\u2019s writing will be supplemented with reference to the contexts he chose and those that have been imposed upon him, from the abstractions of W.B. Yeats\u2019s late plays and Jack B. Yeats\u2019s late paintings, to the deadpan of Buster Keaton\u2019s films, to existentialism, the \u201ctheater of the absurd,\u201d and minimalism. We will read critical and theoretical responses to Beckett\u2019s work, from Theodor Adorno to Pascale Casanova, and consider his vast legacy in texts by Harold Pinter, John Banville, Susan Sontag, Enrique Vila-Matas, Susan Howe, Marina Carr and others.           Engl.GA.1972    Howard Besser (cross-listed with Cinema Studies)    Topics in Digital Humanities: Free Culture and Open Access    Thursday 6:00 - 10:00 PM      At the root of \"Free Culture\" and \"Open Access\" lies the idea that aesthetic and informational works become public resources that should be shared. This interdisciplinary class examines both ideas from a variety of perspectives: aesthetics, politics, law, and social movements. It pays particular attention to the relationship between these ideas and the rise of new forms of media that allow age-old concepts like \"The Commons\" to flourish. It also situates these ideas within longstanding practices of both scholarship and librarianship. The course places a focus on contemporary and very recent activities, and will also examine closely related ideas and movements such as \"Information Wants to be Free\", Free Software, CopyLeft, and Access to Knowledge.           Engl.GA.2062    Mark Sanders (cross-listed with Comparative Literature)    Studies in Prose Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction    Wednesday 11:00 AM - 1:45 PM      When J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man , and Elizabeth Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zoe Wicomb, while at the same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The Childhood of Jesus .           Engl.GA.2270    Hal Momma    Topics in Medieval Lit: Medieval Visions and Travels in the Other World    Monday 3:30 - 5:30 PM      This course takes a new approach to early medieval English literature by reading two types of texts that are usually designated as two separate genres: visions and travel narratives. Upon closer look, however, we recognize similarities between them. In both genres, the subject of experience (i.e. the traveler, the dreamer, etc.) leaves home, visits a strange place, observes extraordinary phenomena, and comes home to bear witness. The close relationship between the two was apparently understood by classical and medieval authors, for visions and travels often appear side by side in their wok (Cicero, Vergil, and Dante come to mind); and in case of some genres, the coupling of the two has even become a convention (e.g. epic/heroic poetry and, to a certain degree, hagiography).      The course will mainly focus on Old English texts, both verse and prose, but we will also compare them with literature of vision and/or travel from antiquity (e.g. Aeneid, Dream of Scipio with Macrobius); medieval Ireland, Scandinavia, and the Continent (e.g. imram, zombie sagas, The Divine Comedy); and post-Conquest Britain (Pearl, Sir John Mandeville). The ultimate goal of the course is for us to build, collectively, a new perspective on early medieval literature, while, individually, developing conference-worthy topics and publishable essays.           Engl.GA.2414    Ernest Gilman    Age of Donne: The New Philosophy calls all in doubt    Thursday 1:00 - 3:00 PM      The subtitle of this course comes from Donne\u2019s \u201cAnatomy\u201d\u2014his vivisection of the body of the world to discover the cause of its imminent demise. For Donne, the unsettling speculations of the \u201cNew Philosophy,\u201d in this instance Kepler\u2019s heliocentric theory and Galileo\u2019s observations through the telescope, are key symptoms of the world\u2019s moribund condition. The search for \u201cconstancy\u201d that marks the Songs and Sonnets is frustrated by the revelation of a \u201cnew\u201d world characterized by vagrant movement. The proper philosophical stance called for in these circumstances is \u201cdoubt,\u201d a neo-skepticism which, like the word \u201cnew\u201d in the period has both positive and negative connotations. With Donne\u2019s poetry at the center of the circle, this course radiates out to other themes and writers in the orbit of (what we would call) the scientific revolution, including Luther, Vesalius, Montaigne, Gilbert, Galileo, Hobbes, Descartes, and Milton.           Engl.GA.2620    Laurence Lockridge    Romantic Movement    Thursday 3:30 - 5:30 PM      William Blake, William Wordsworth, Dorothy Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, and John Keats are the canonical British Romantic writers considered in this seminar. Participants are free to pursue less familiar writers of the period if they so choose. Though a syllabus and set of discussion topics are shared by all, topics for term essays may reflect the particular critical and scholarly interests of participants working off syllabus.      Among standard topics to be discussed: Blake\u2019s revolutionary satire and mythology; the literary relationship of Coleridge, Dorothy Wordsworth, and William Wordsworth; Romantic autobiography; Coleridge as philosophic critic; William Wordsworth and the uses of memory; Lord Byron as performance artist; Percy Shelley and the Romantic theory of mind; Mary Shelley\u2019s questioning of Romantic ideology; Keats and cultural poetics; formal innovations in Romantic narrative, lyric, and drama; Romantic politics; representations of gender, race, and class; and issues concerning the Romantic canon. Such topics tend to be perennial; the seminar will seek out the state of current critical play concerning them.      Prominent schools of modern theory and criticism\u2014from archetypal, formalist, psychoanalytic, and ethical to feminist, historicist, and deconstructive\u2014have found in British Romantic writers a literature of great import. We debate a variety of such approaches.           Engl.GA.2720    Perry Meisel    Woolf, Mansfield, Cather    Monday 6:20 - 8:20 PM     An examination of Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather as transatlantic modernists based on their common influence by Katherine Mansfield. Mansfield's dialectical source is the transatlantic Henry James, whose social impressionism she sharpens by gendering and eroticizing. Woolf's dialectic with Mansfield is resolved by her use of Pater's sensory impressionism to unsex Mansfield while retaining her Jamesian psychologism and vivid sense of domestic life. Cather's dialectic with Mansfield is resolved by her use of Hardy's focus on the working farm to materialize Mansfield's psychologism and give it a more overt basis in the means of production that James's suppression of labor abjures. Biographical and historical contexts will be supplied to ground this literary assessment in the cold light of fact. Doing so redoubles Woolf and Cather's own relationship to Mansfield by inscribing it within a material and historical frame. Readings will begin with James, Pater, and Hardy before proceeding to the course's primary focus on Mansfield, Woolf, and Cather. Texts will include Mansfield's stories; Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando , and Between the Acts ; and Cather's O Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, A Lost Lady, The Professor\u2019s House , and Lucy Gayheart .          Engl.GA.2805    Pat Crain and Catherine Robson    Transatlantic Childhoods    Wednesday 3:30 - 5:30      This seminar explores what we can see better, or see anew, when we juxtapose American and British experiences of, and responses to, emergent ideas and ideals of childhood in the child-obsessed nineteenth-century. After setting up key eighteenth-century concepts and contexts for what French historian Philippe Ari\u00e8s called the \"invention of childhood,\" we'll explore the ways in which children came to be defined between 1800 and 1900, in relation to such rubrics as law, labor, education, sex, play, and psychology, through examinations of both \"literary\" works and texts and artifacts from a range of other discourses and spheres. We'll pivot between American and British examples, aiming to track the commonalities at work in our two nations and the effects of marked structural differences. Here we'll be especially attentive to chattel slavery in the U.S., and to the relations, and non-relations, between the racialized notions of childhood produced in this country and those which arise out of Britain's sharply stratified class landscape. If race and class are produced differently, we'll also consider the degree to which British and American histories and representations of boyhood and girlhood converge and diverge across the period. We\u2019ll close with reflections on the ways in which a range of literary genres on the cusp of modernism form themselves in and through the new discourses of childhood and evolving figures of the child.      We will make use of special collections at Fales, New York Public Library, and other local archives.           Engl.GA.2900    Rajeswari Sunder Rajan    Postcolonial Thought: Politics, Ethics, Philosophy    Tuesday 6:20 - 8:20 PM      This seminar outlines a global intellectual history that looks at the diverse ways in which thinkers in Africa and Asia responded to colonialism in the last two centuries, to both colonial rule itself and the contact of cultures produced by colonial rule or European domination in other forms. The resulting discourse, which is here broadly identified under the heads of \u2018politics, ethics, and philosophy\u2019, is in fact an eclectic one, not containable within formal disciplinary boundaries. These writings are not what constitute \u2018postcolonial theory\u2019 as it is known and canonized in metropolitan academic studies. They have tended indeed to be overlooked as \u2018theory\u2019, but are now coming to the attention of historians of intellectual thought.      As we might expect, it was in the colonies rather than in the metropolis that the meeting of cultures resulted in the most productive intellectual consequences. The new knowledge from the west\u2014in the form of disciplines, ideas, epistemologies, and values-- was eagerly absorbed, processed, debated, contested and creatively re-thought by those who encountered it. Forged in the crucible of anti-colonial struggle are the ethics of non-violence, pacifism and sacrifice; ideas of universalism, egalitarianism and brotherhood; the reactive politics of nationalism; revisionary and adaptive Marxisms; major initiatives in political and social reform; and the politicization of religion.      How influential has \u2018postcolonial thought\u2019 been within decolonized nations and globally? How radical is it in its originality, its difference from European thought? Some of the figures whose life and work will be considered are (in no particular order): M.K. Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, B. R. Ambedkar, Tarabai Shinde (India); Muhammad Iqbal (India, Pakistan); Anagarika Dharmapala, Ananda Coomaraswamy (Ceylon/Sri Lanka); Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (Afghanistan?); Ali Shariati (Iran); Liang Qichao (China); Tenshin Okakura (Japan); Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u (Vietnam); Kartini (Indonesia); Jomo Kenyatta (Kenya); Kwame Nkrumah (Ghana); Samir Amin (Egypt); Abdullahi An-Na\u2019im (Sudan); Edouard Glissant (Martinique ). Writings by three or four of these will be studied in detail, the rest in broad survey mode.           Engl.GA.2902    Sonya Posmentier    Topics in Black Lit: Literary and Cultural Criticism from the Black Diaspora    Thursday 1:00 - 3:00 PM      In her 1988 lecture on the American literary canon, \u201cUnspeakable Things Unspoken\u201d Toni Morrison responded to the emergence of the \u201cAfro-American artistic presence\u201d in white literary discourse: \u201cit is no longer acceptable merely to imagine us and imagine for us. We have always been imagining ourselves\u2026. \u201c Morrison called for future theories of black literature equal to the history and present of black literature, and simultaneously called attention to the past and present of black theory. In this class we will pay attention to her call. How do black writers, artists and critics theorize their work in relationship to mainstream literary and cultural criticism, while at the same time claiming autochthonous critical traditions? And how have concepts such as double-consciousness, mimicry, calibanization, nation language and black optimism informed our readings of modern literature?      To answer these questions we\u2019ll delve into theories of performance, gender, sexuality, reading, nation and race emerging from and around black literature and culture. We will also consider how modern and contemporary theories of black art extend beyond the framework of the nation state that contained Morrison\u2019s groundbreaking critique. Readings may include works by: Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Sterling Brown, James Baldwin, George Lamming, Amiri Baraka, Audre Lorde, Ralph Ellison, CLR James, Ng\u0169g\u0129 Wa Thiong\u2019o, Houston Baker, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Alice Walker, Kamau Brathwaite, \u00c9douard Glissant, Barbara Johnson, Valerie Smith, Fred Moten, and others. In their writing and their reading, students will also have the opportunity to analyze and practice multiple forms of critical work, from the critical essay to the interview.           Engl.GA.2916    Patrick Deer    The Contemporary Novel and the Culture of War    Wednesday 1:00 - 3:00 PM      This seminar will explore contemporary American, British and Anglophone fiction and non-fiction representations of war. Reading in a transatlantic frame, we will focus on the work of writers and intellectuals who have struggled to create in the shadow of violence and to resist its seductive logic. In order to give students a sense of the range and diversity of contemporary war writing, the course will counterpoint selected texts from modern war literature and culture with the recent wave of literary and non-fiction representations from Iraq, Afghanistan and the \u201cglobal war on terror.\u201d We will trace genealogies for recent war literature and culture in the era of colonial warfare and the dislocations of World War I, through the total war culture of World War Two, the apocalyptic imaginary of Cold War, guerilla warfare and counterinsurgency, to the high tech claims of \u201cpostmodern warfare.\u201d We will also consider the wider implications of censorship, propaganda, trauma, the war economy, and the technologies of violence for postmodern and contemporary narrative and popular memory. Focusing on themes of gender, trauma, imperialism, and resistance, the course will explore the intimate relations between contemporary literature, reportage, film and media, and military discourse.       Readings may be drawn from the work of: Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Ernst Junger, Primo Levi, George Orwell, Graham Greene, Thomas Pynchon, Tim O\u2019Brien, Pat Barker, Martin Amis, Michael Ondaatje, Anthony Swofford, Gabe Hudson, Colby Buzzell, Kayla Williams, Dexter Filkins, Riverbend, Kevin Powers, and Ben Fountain.

In this course, we will approach both Latino/a and Modernism as open-ended terms, in an effort to bring together a broad range of texts (potentially including poems, novels, essays, drama, memoir, folklore, journalism, film, mural art, music, and dance) from around 1890 to 1950. We will consider national differences and contexts, emphasizing key terms (border, diaspora, exile) and stressing hemispheric, transnational, and cross-cultural contexts. We will pay special attention to spatial politics, and to the intersections between modernist form and a variety of vernacular practices and expressive cultures. Acknowledging the \u201cdouble attachments\u201d (Anglo, Hispanic) that frame Ilan Stavans's introduction to The Norton Anthology of Latino Literature (2011), we will also seek to complicate Stavans's formulation by examining a constellation of identifications (blackness, indigeneity, gender, and others).      Literary texts may include works by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, William Carlos Williams, Salom\u00f3n de la Selva, Jaime de Angulo, Leonor Villegas de Magn\u00f3n, Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a, Am\u00e9rico Paredes, Jovita Gonz\u00e1lez, Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, Julia de Burgos, Pura Belpr\u00e9, Alberto O'Farrill, Eugenio Florit, and Josefina Niggli. Performances may include works by Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, Eusebia Cosme, Machito and his Afro-Cubans, Canario y Su Grupo, Lupe V\u00e9lez, and Maria Montez. Critical readings may include works by Laura Lomas, Kristen Silva Gruesz, Marissa K. L\u00f3pez, Antonio L\u00f3pez, Lisa S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, Fredric Jameson, Henri Lefebvre, Miriam Hansen, Alicia Schmidt Camacho, Ruth Glasser, Rosa-Linda Fregoso, Marta Moreno Vega, and Silvio Torres-Saillant.

How can a history of paper supplement and enrich recent histories of printing technology and printed artifacts like \"the book\"? What would it mean to imagine a paperless future? Organized around discussions of readings in common, this course considers the history, production, circulation and use of paper in the social production of knowledge, the shared imagination of value, and the mutual relations of consumers and commodities.           Engl.GA.2971    David Hoover (cross-listed with the Draper Program)    Topics in Digital Humanities: Digital Literary Studies    Thursday 6:20 - 8:20 PM      The availability of digital resources has significantly changed literary studies, especially because of the rapid increase the accessability of literary and critical texts that were previously very difficult to locate or access, or were extremely rare. Because of their digital form, such texts can be searched and can be transferred almost instantaneously from place to place. Yet locating, accessing, searching, and easily distributing digital texts are not the only ways of taking advantage of their digital nature.      This course will investigate some of the ways that manipulation and analysis can more fully exploit the nature of digital texts. We will consider some methods of distant reading, such as those recently practiced by Franco Moretti in Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for a Literary History (London: Verso, 2005)\u2013methods possible only since the advent of huge collections of publicly available digital texts. We will also consider some methods of very close reading that digital texts and tools make possible for the first time, including those introduced by Hugh Craig and Arthur Kinney in Shakespeare, Computers, and the Mystery of Authorship (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009). Along the way, we will work with individual digital literary texts, specially constructed iterary corpora, online portals, databases, natural language corpora, text collections, and single-author sites, and with digital archives, including some, like the Willa Cather Digital Archive, the Brown Women Writers Project, and the MONK project, that include their own analytical tools.      Our goal will be to apply innovative techniques to long-standing literary questions and to explore kinds of inquiries that digital texts and tools have made possible for the first time. We will focus on a fairly wide range of literature in English from about 1800 to about 1925, to avoid copyright problems, but students can study texts from any period and in many different languages in their own projects. The course assumes no advanced computational background, but it will take place in a computer lab (PC computers; some of the software does not run on Macs), and will involve extensive hands-on computational analysis.

Readings in theory of allegory and ideology will complement a focus on epic. We will explore the relation of pastoral and epic, placing pastoral moments in The Faerie Queene against selections from The Shepheardes Calendar and from Vergil and Theocritus. Some attention will be paid to the visual tradition of representing epic and allegory, including mythological paintings, emblem books, iconography and Renaissance mythography (Cartari, Conti and others). We will rethink the convergences and divergences of epic, allegory and romance as they help to shape questions of gender, nation, ideology and ethics.

How does the contemporary novel construct narrative worlds? And how does it now circulate in the world outside it? This course will rethink recent fiction from the last decade in light of two theoretical problems: \u201cworldliness\u201d and \"the contemporary\". We will begin by reading broadly from recent theories of postmodernism, postcolonial studies, world literature and novel theory in order to assess the field of contemporary fiction. We will thus encounter a range of critical concepts and categories that have structured recent debates: \u201cworlding\u201d, \u201cworld literature\u201d, \u201cthe human rights novel\u201d, \u201cplanetarity\u201d, \u201cdystopia\u201d, \u201chysterical realism\u201d and so forth. We will then move on to consider recent fiction: How does it understand the concept of the political? For what kind of ethical act does it create the narrative conditions? We will read Anglophone fiction and will also pay particular attention to the question of the post 9/11 novel: Aravind Adiga\u2019s The White Tiger , Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth , Don DeLillo\u2019s Falling Man , Teju Cole\u2019s Open City , Tom McCarthy\u2019s Remainder , Michael Ondaatje\u2019s Anils Ghost , Chris Abani's Graceland .
