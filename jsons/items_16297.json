Whether you are relocating from abroad, a current NYU housing resident, or considering a change of your current living situation, the apartment hunting process is often bewildering for even long time New Yorkers.   The NYU Student Resource Center can advise you with your search process. Although we do not provide actual off-campus apartments, we can advise you on the search process through a variety of resources available on this website. To aid your housing search we provide a centralized list of commonly used websites for apartment searches, a roommate registry, NYC market information, legal resources and local brokers, and more. But be prepared -- it's not easy!
