To that end, NYU has created the NYU Postdoctoral and Transition Program for Academic Diversity Fellowship Program to attract and support promising scholars and educators from different backgrounds, races, ethnic groups, and other diverse groups whose life experience, research experience, and employment background will contribute significantly to academic excellence. Applicants with strengths in the sciences, health professions, law, and social sciences will be particularly welcome.

Each document is limited to 5MB. We recommend that your statements not exceed five pages each.                                                                                                                                                                          Is it acceptable to submit additional materials?                                                       No. We do not have the resources to consider materials other than those requested.                                                                                                                                                                          What should I include in my statement of research and goals?                                                        The research you describe in your statement should be the research you intend to conduct if you were to become a fellow. Your goals should include what you would like to accomplish if you were a fellow and how that fits into your long-term career goals. We recommend that you limit your research statement to five pages.                                                                                                                                                                          Do I need to know which department would host me?                                                        You will be asked to suggest a school and, where appropriate, a department that would host you. Therefore, we advise you to study the NYU website before you make your request. However, we do not guarantee that fellows will be placed in the school or department they request. Your hosting school and department will depend on factors such as the availability of a mentor.                                                                                                                                                                          Do I need to have a mentor identified when I apply?                                                        No. You do not need to identify a mentor. You are welcome to make recommendations. Should you be chosen as a fellow your school would match you with an appropriate mentor.                                                                                     Eligibility                                                                                                                            What if I do not have my Ph.D. now, but I plan to complete my Ph.D. before the fellowship begins?                                                        You may apply in the doctoral student category, but you will have to present evidence that you have completed all the requirements for the Ph.D. when the fellowship begins.                                                                                     Reference Letters                                                                                                                            How many letters of reference do I need? How are they submitted?                                                        NYU must receive a minimum of 3 letters of reference to consider you fully for this fellowship. The system will email the reference providers you submit, and you will be able to track the status of these reference letters online. An email request will be sent. You may, however, want to contact the referent directly to make certain they are aware of the request. Important: please note that the system will not email your reference providers until you receive a confirmation number that you have finished applying. You must attach required documents and fill out the application form completely to receive a confirmation number.                                                                                                                                                                          Is Interfolio compatible with the application system?                                                        Yes. When you submit the name and email address of a referee into the application system, do not enter the referee's direct email address. Instead, enter the unique email address that Interfolio has assigned to that referee (Interfolio assigns a unique email address for every reference provider when Interfolio receives a letter to be filed.). You may go to your personal Interfolio 'web delivery' page and from there copy and paste the unique e-mail address Interfolio assigned to the reference writer. Thus, when the application system sends out its automatic email to request a referee letter, the email is sent to Interfolio. Based on the e-mail address, Interfolio uploads the appropriate letter into the application system.                                                                                     Fellowship Requirements                                                                                                                            What does the in-residence requirement mean?                                                        The fellowship requires that you live within the New York City metropolitan area. A goal of the program is to build a community in which the fellows are available to participate.                                                                                                                                                                          May fellows choose their own housing? Is there housing suggested/provided by NYU?                                                        We do not provide housing for the fellows. We provide an allowance and, if requested, some guidance in navigating the New York City real estate market.                                                                                                                                                                          What is required of a fellow participating in the program?                                                        As a fellow, you would be required to teach up to one course per semester. Generally, we expect fellows to participate in the life of the department and school as well as participate in the community of fellows.                                                                                     Additional Questions                                                                                                                            Whom may I contact if I have additional questions about the fellowship?

We recommend that you limit your research statement to five pages.                                                                                                                                                                          Do I need to know which department would host me?                                                        You will be asked to suggest a school and, where appropriate, a department that would host you. Therefore, we advise you to study the NYU website before you make your request. However, we do not guarantee that fellows will be placed in the school or department they request. Your hosting school and department will depend on factors such as the availability of a mentor.                                                                                                                                                                          Do I need to have a mentor identified when I apply?                                                        No. You do not need to identify a mentor. You are welcome to make recommendations. Should you be chosen as a fellow your school would match you with an appropriate mentor.                                                                                     Eligibility                                                                                                                            What if I do not have my Ph.D. now, but I plan to complete my Ph.D. before the fellowship begins?                                                        You may apply in the doctoral student category, but you will have to present evidence that you have completed all the requirements for the Ph.D. when the fellowship begins.                                                                                     Reference Letters                                                                                                                            How many letters of reference do I need? How are they submitted?                                                        NYU must receive a minimum of 3 letters of reference to consider you fully for this fellowship. The system will email the reference providers you submit, and you will be able to track the status of these reference letters online. An email request will be sent. You may, however, want to contact the referent directly to make certain they are aware of the request. Important: please note that the system will not email your reference providers until you receive a confirmation number that you have finished applying. You must attach required documents and fill out the application form completely to receive a confirmation number.                                                                                                                                                                          Is Interfolio compatible with the application system?                                                        Yes. When you submit the name and email address of a referee into the application system, do not enter the referee's direct email address. Instead, enter the unique email address that Interfolio has assigned to that referee (Interfolio assigns a unique email address for every reference provider when Interfolio receives a letter to be filed.). You may go to your personal Interfolio 'web delivery' page and from there copy and paste the unique e-mail address Interfolio assigned to the reference writer. Thus, when the application system sends out its automatic email to request a referee letter, the email is sent to Interfolio. Based on the e-mail address, Interfolio uploads the appropriate letter into the application system.                                                                                     Fellowship Requirements                                                                                                                            What does the in-residence requirement mean?                                                        The fellowship requires that you live within the New York City metropolitan area. A goal of the program is to build a community in which the fellows are available to participate.                                                                                                                                                                          May fellows choose their own housing? Is there housing suggested/provided by NYU?                                                        We do not provide housing for the fellows. We provide an allowance and, if requested, some guidance in navigating the New York City real estate market.                                                                                                                                                                          What is required of a fellow participating in the program?                                                        As a fellow, you would be required to teach up to one course per semester. Generally, we expect fellows to participate in the life of the department and school as well as participate in the community of fellows.                                                                                     Additional Questions                                                                                                                            Whom may I contact if I have additional questions about the fellowship?

Whom may I contact if I have additional questions about the online application process?

Diversity at NYU has historically been broadly defined, encompassing differences across categories of race and ethnicity, gender, age, ability, political belief, economic status, and sexual orientation. By supporting scholars\u2019 transitions into the professorate, New York University intends to increase the number of faculty who reflect expanding diversity in an increasingly global society. To that end, NYU has created the NYU Postdoctoral and Transition Program for Academic Diversity fellowship program to support promising scholars and educators from different backgrounds, races, ethnic groups, and other under-represented groups whose life experience, research experience, and employment background will contribute significantly to academic excellence at NYU. Fellowships are focused on strong model of mentorship in their participating departments, geared towards maximizing scholarly productivity and professional development.     Eligibility   The fellowship program is open to all areas of study at the University. Individuals who meet one of the following criteria are eligible to apply:     Individuals who have completed their dissertation within the last three years or who will have completed their dissertation by September 1, 2015; or     Professionals transitioning to academic careers (for those in field for which the doctorate is not the terminal degree);     Priority is given to candidates who do not currently hold postdoctoral fellowships or traineeships.       Awards   NYU will award up to five in-residence fellowships in 2015. Appointments are for two years and begin September 2015 and end August 2017. Fellows teach a maximum of one course per semester, participate in school and departmental activities, and have mentorship opportunities to prepare them for an academic career.     Compensation and Allowances   Fellows will be appointed as \u201cAssistant Professor/Faculty Fellow\u201d and will receive a $40,000 nine-month salary; an annual housing allowance ($20,000); a research allowance ($2,000); and reimbursement for one-time relocation fees (up to $3,000). Such compensation will be subject to appropriate taxation. The University also provides a benefits package, including medical and dental coverage.     Application Procedure   Required application materials include (1) a fellowship application; (2) a curriculum vitae; (3) a statement of research, fellowship goals, and identification of one or more programs or mentors that would represent a good fit for the proposed fellowship; (4) a personal statement detailing the reasons for applying for the fellowship; (5) three letters of reference from individuals familiar with your scholarly or creative work; and (6) one of the following: a dissertation abstract (postdoctoral applicants); or a statement of how your professional experience prepares you for a faculty position (professionals).
