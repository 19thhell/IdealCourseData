Courses are taught in Spanish and English by some of Argentina's most talented scholars, journalists, public health professionals, as well as renowned writers and musicians. The curriculum provides a cultural frame to coursework offered in subjects ranging from art history, cinema studies, and creative writing to politics, sociology, and economics. All students at NYU Buenos Aires take a Spanish language course at their appropriate level upon arrival or, if advanced, an elective in the language.   A place of renewed growth and prosperity, Buenos Aires is one of the most important financial and cultural centers in Latin America. The NYU academic center is located in the handsome Recoleta district, near vibrant Avenida Santa Fe. Staff members organize and offer a myriad of activities for students to take part in. Ranging from regional travel to destinations such as Iguazu Falls, Rosario, and Tigre to taking tango lessons throughout the semester. Volunteer opportunities at local NGOs and media offices open doors for students to engage in the community and practice Spanish. Museums, class fieldtrips, and concerts offer opportunities to go beyond day-to-day cultural experiences and better understand the dynamic past and present of the Argentine capital. Homestays bring the everyday Argentine way of living to life as students share meals, ideas and activities with their host parents.    A lecture series on topics such as human rights, vanguard art and literature, youth and political engagement, political economics and multicultural identity add precise perspectives to the expansive experience of this dynamic region.

Courses are taught in Spanish and English by some of Argentina's most talented scholars, journalists, public health professionals, as well as renowned writers and musicians. The curriculum provides a cultural frame to coursework offered in subjects ranging from art history, cinema studies, and creative writing to politics, sociology, and economics. All students at NYU Buenos Aires take a Spanish language course at their appropriate level upon arrival or, if advanced, an elective in the language.   A place of renewed growth and prosperity, Buenos Aires is one of the most important financial and cultural centers in Latin America. The NYU academic center is located in the handsome Recoleta district, near vibrant Avenida Santa Fe. Staff members organize and offer a myriad of activities for students to take part in. Ranging from regional travel to destinations such as Iguazu Falls, Rosario, and Tigre to taking tango lessons throughout the semester. Volunteer opportunities at local NGOs and media offices open doors for students to engage in the community and practice Spanish. Museums, class fieldtrips, and concerts offer opportunities to go beyond day-to-day cultural experiences and better understand the dynamic past and present of the Argentine capital. Homestays bring the everyday Argentine way of living to life as students share meals, ideas and activities with their host parents.    A lecture series on topics such as human rights, vanguard art and literature, youth and political engagement, political economics and multicultural identity add precise perspectives to the expansive experience of this dynamic region.
