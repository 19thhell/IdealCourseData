The nursing process and role of the advanced practice nurse is applied in the clinical setting as a framework for managing health care of children and adolescents and their families. Students participate in client care management, including advanced assessment, health promotion, developmental appraisal, disease prevention, and management of common problems using an evidence-based practice model. Case studies integrate the concepts of diagnostic reasoning, the acquisition of advanced practice skills, and appropriate use of technology and research application in the primary care setting. This course has a minimum of 270 hours of supervised clinical experience in ambulatory care settings.
