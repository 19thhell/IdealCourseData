RAMBI Index of Articles on Jewish Studies RAMBI is a selective bibliography of articles in the various fields of Jewish studies and in the study of the State of Israel. The Index is based to a large extent on the collections of the Jewish National and University Library, Jerusalem. Religion Index This database is maintained by ATLA (The American Theological Library Association) and covers the research literature of religion, from 1949 forward, in over 30 languages from 1,400 international journals and 16,500 multi-author works. \u00c9cole Biblique et Arch\u00e9ologique Fran\u00e7aise Indexes ca. more than 140,000 volumes and 400 specialized periodicals. A very useful discovery tool. In the results list click on the title link to get the citation, then search BobCat to find our whether we have the journal or book in electronic or print form. Online Egyptological Bibliography The Online Egyptological Bibliography (OEB) includes the volumes of the previous Annual Egyptological Bibliography (AEB) combined with the Bibliographie Alt\u00e4gypten (BA), covering Egyptological literature from 1822 to 2002, as well as partial treatment of 2003-2012.

Tyndale House: Gateway for Biblical Research Enormous collection of links to online primary and secondary resources on Biblical and Second Temple subjects. No short description can do justice to the variety and number of resources gathered here. A special note must be made of their \u201c2 Letter Lookup\u201d \u2013 an online dictionary which provides all possible Biblical words and their definitions on the basis of their first two letters so you do not have to worry about which letters form part of the root of the word. Available languages in this lexicon are: Hebrew/Aramaic, Greek, Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Akkadian and Arabic.                                              TIP: getting from Citation to Full Text                 Searching the Religion Index click on the NYU icon  next to a citation to get options for full text. If full text is not available, which is often the case for older journal articles, click on the BobCat link, and search for a print version of the journal. If Bobst does not have a print subscription, request the article through Interlibrary Loan .   Since RAMBI does not have the NYU icon  copy the journal title and search for full text through the E-Journals and E-Texts link. Follow the above steps, if full text is not available.
