Instructor: Adam Mirza The term \"chamber music\" designates various genres of classical music that traditionally took place in domestic or semi-private environments. More broadly, the idea of chamber music idealizes the intimate encounters between musicians and audiences that happen in small venues. In this course we will examine several forms of chamber music, including the string quartet, art song, Renaissance vocal polyphony, Baroque chamber works, and chamber music of the 20th and 21st centuries. We will consider chamber music in connection with its European provenance, and then examine how chamber music has flourished in New York City. We will visit locations like Carnegie Hall's modern chamber music space (Zankel Hall), a grungy basement jazz club (the Village Vanguard), a recital space for classical music that floats under the Broolyn Bridge (Bargemusic), and a Lower East Side living room that doubles as a brewing ground for experimental music (Spectrum). Students will maintain listening journals and write concert reports that explore the interactions fostered by the (in)congruencies of venue, genre and musical performance that occur in these modern musical chambers of New York City. Music of New York: Neighborhoods, Scenes, and Institutions - MUSIC-UA 100 (section 002) Time: Monday, Wednesday, Friday 10:00 A.M. - 2:00 P.M. Instructor: Anoosua Mukherjee This course will provide students with a cultural survey of the diverse music practices of New York City: the classically-oriented institutions of Lincoln Center (the Metropolitan Opera House, Carnegie Hall and the New York City Ballet), the populist musical theater of Broadway, the heritage of Harlem jazz, and the underground dance music of lower Manhattan. Students will become familiar with these various forms of music-making through readings, lectures, discussions, live performances and tours. Local musicians and scholars will present during scheduled class time, and students will be asked to attend concerts and performances on their own. We will focus our attention on early and mid-twentieth-century music, identifying key figures and artistic movements in New York City, as well as relevant intersections with other art forms such as architecture, painting and dance. This course will also address the central issues that continue to shape our understanding of American music culture: its folk roots and art-music aspirations; its commercial reality and anti-establishment rebellions; its racial politics and sexual hang-ups; its national agenda and international manifestations. Students will be challenged to develop their listening abilities, deepen their historical knowledge of important issues, and further their appreciation of the sonic environment around them.

Home > Undergraduate Program     Undergraduate Program Undergraduate students in the department study, create, and perform music in an environment that combines the benefits of a well-rounded liberal arts education with the resources of a major research university.      Resources    Our students have a wealth of resources available for their research, performance, and creative work. The Shorin Music Performance Center offers a large number of rehearsal and practice rooms and the Department has its own intimate, loft-likeperformance space that serves as a recording studio and as a venue for recitals and concerts. Two cutting-edge technology labs - The Washington Square Computer Music Studio and the Media Lab - provide digital resources for composition and research. Professional sound recording and video equipment is available for check-out. The Department hosts the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society , the Collegium Musicum, and the Washington Square Harp and Shamrock Orchestra , the only Irish music ensemble in any university in the U.S. Our students can also join ensembles sponsored by the Steinhardt School of Education , such as the NYU Symphony Orchestra. The Department's greatest asset, however, is its location in the heart of New York City, one of the world's great cultural centers. Many of our courses are structured around live performances at venues ranging from the city's  top concert halls to its most obscure performance spaces. We also encourage students to take advantage of our location by pursuing internships with NYC-based recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations.      The Undergraduate Program    Students pursuing a major or minor in music gain proficiency in theory, history, criticism, and interpretation of music traditions throughout the world. At the same time, our students develop skills in analysis, critical thinking, composition, and writing that are valuable across disciplines. As a result, the major and minor in music constitute excellent preparation for graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; for careers in music, media, and culture industries; or for any occupation demanding clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.    In addition to a curriculum designed for majors and minors, we offer a wide range of innovative courses - in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, popular music, music theory, composition, historical performance, jazz, and the emerging field of sound studies - that are addressed to the general student. Recent and upcoming undergraduate courses include:               Harmony and Counterpoint (4 semesters) History of European Music (4 semesters)    Popular Music in Latin/o American and the Caribbean Music, War and Memory Twelve Masterworks of 20th century Music    Principles of Composition: Electroacoustic Music    Advanced Seminar in Jazz Studies    Introduction to Celtic Music    The Art of Listening: From Bach to Bjork on the Streets of New York    Global Hip Hop and the Politics of Culture    Musical 'Complexities'/Theoretical Perplexity    Anthropology of Improvisation    Alternate Canons: The Black Rock Coalition    Native American Music and Poetics    Spectral Music: A Chord or and Attitude?
