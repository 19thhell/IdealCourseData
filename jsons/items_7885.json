With case-based teaching, students develop skills in analytical thinking by reading and discussing complex, real-life scenarios.    Pioneered in the early 20th Century at Harvard University, the case method has become a teaching method in most of the world's leading business schools. A process of discussion and analysis, guided by a skilled case teacher, leads class participants to deeper insights into management and business issues and their resolution. Faculty and students familiar with the case method universally regard it as the most effective and enjoyable way to learn.

As NYU approached a juncture where our course management system, Blackboard, would require a substantial upgrade, Provost Dave McLaughlin asked the Teaching Technology Committee, chaired by Senior Vice Provost Matthew Santirocco, to take the opportunity to review NYU\u2019s needs and determine what product best suited the University. After considerable review, the Committee recommended that we replace Blackboard with Sakai, now called NYU Classes.   Meeting the Need     The transition to NYU Classes moved us from a sole-sourced commercial product to an open-source learning management environment. And that change allows us to have significant say in the software\u2019s ongoing development. It also provides an open framework to integrate other important tools, such as Google Apps, to support teaching, learning, and scholarship.     Making It Work     The move to the NYU Classes platform better serves the teaching and learning process at NYU. Now faculty can use NYU Classes to create online course environments, share content, track assignment, use the Gradebook functionality and much more. Students can use NYU Classes to connect with other students and stay on track with assignments using an aggregated calendar for due dates across all their courses.
