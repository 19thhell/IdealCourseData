Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           This short course will explore the concept of accountability within humanitarian intervention. In particular it will look at the contemporary significance of accountability for humanitarian response \u2013 when and why it has become an important concept for humanitarian intervention, and specific events that have led to a shift from donors to recipients of aid as the agents of accountability.      Key questions that will be explored include:   - To whom are humanitarian agencies accountable? What are the competing accountabilities and how do these influence program decisions and agency performance?   - Why is accountability to beneficiaries important during a humanitarian response? Aside from ideological views, why should the humanitarian sector be concerned with accountability to beneficiaries? What are its end goals?   - What does an effective accountability mechanism look like? How do agencies implement it?   - Do these work? In what contexts? How is their effectiveness being measured? By whom?   - Who are the main actors in this space? An examination of HAP, ALNAP, Listen First, ECB project, current NGO frameworks used in the field.

Although some of the initial development agencies are still operating and remain influential, the way they function has evolved and important new players have entered the field. This course provides an overview of contemporary debates in international development assistance with a detailed review of the major actors - multilateral, bilateral, and nongovernmental. The course explores the political economy of donor-client country relationships, the key accountability challenges that have emerged, and the link between accountability and aid effectiveness. Particular emphasis is given to recent approaches to development assistance that have attempted to bridge the accountability-effectiveness divide.

Algorithms increasingly shape our news, economic options, and educational trajectories. The centrality and concerns about algorithmic decision making have only increased since we hosted the Governing Algorithms conference in May 2013. This event built upon that conversation to address legal, policy and ethical challenges related to algorithmic power in three specific contexts: media production and consumption, commerce, and education.   Date, Location, Organization   The Algorithms and Accountability conference took place on Saturday, February 28th, 2015, at New York University, Lipton Hall, NYC. Organized by the Information Law Institute, NYU School of Law, it was cosponsored by NYU Steinhardt Department of Media, Culture and Communications, the Intel Science &amp; Technology Center for Social Computing and Microsoft. The organizing committee consists of Joris van Hoboken, Helen Nissenbaum and Elana Zeide.
