The Masters of Science degree in Integrated Digital Media is a 3-semester program that combines high-end media production with the investigation of new tools, techniques, and experimental practices. Students take graduate-level coursework in creative coding, media studies, and media law, as well as graduate level production classes in web design and development, digital cinema, digital photography, game design and development, sound, live performance, interaction design, and mobile augmented reality. Graduate level special topics courses currently include assistive technology, human computer interfaces (HCI), mobile application development, user experience (UX) design, among many others. Students can also take courses in other School of Engineering programs (Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering), as well as other NYU programs such as Steinhardt&#39;s Music Technology and Tisch&#39;s Interactive Telecommunications (ITP). Students are expected to combine theory and experimental practice to create a master&#39;s thesis that showcases their creative and technical skills in a fully realized research project around the creative applications of media and technology. Graduate students in IDM participate fully in research initiatives through the Brooklyn Experimental Media Center.      The  Brooklyn Experimental Media Center (BxmC) is the research arm of Integrated Digital Media at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. BxmC provides an interdisciplinary environment for media research at the School of Engineering, partnering faculty and students from the Integrated Digital Media program with collaborators from the School of Engineering, NYU, Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), New York City, and beyond. Our research combines experimental practices in media arts and engineering, constantly modifying industry-standard technologies and creating new ones. The BxmC has a close relationship with the School of Engineering&#39;s Incubators &mdash;Varick St., DUMBO and NYC-ACRE&mdash;to provide students with opportunities for internships and startup development in the ever-growing NY tech-start up scene.

Our students are artists, engineers and entrepreneurs working in highly fluid industries that reward the creative, the thoughtful, the technical, and the innovative.       The Masters of Science degree in Integrated Digital Media is a 3-semester program that combines high-end media production with the investigation of new tools, techniques, and experimental practices. Students take graduate-level coursework in creative coding, media studies, and media law, as well as graduate level production classes in web design and development, digital cinema, digital photography, game design and development, sound, live performance, interaction design, and mobile augmented reality. Graduate level special topics courses currently include assistive technology, human computer interfaces (HCI), mobile application development, user experience (UX) design, among many others. Students can also take courses in other School of Engineering programs (Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering), as well as other NYU programs such as Steinhardt&#39;s Music Technology and Tisch&#39;s Interactive Telecommunications (ITP). Students are expected to combine theory and experimental practice to create a master&#39;s thesis that showcases their creative and technical skills in a fully realized research project around the creative applications of media and technology. Graduate students in IDM participate fully in research initiatives through the Brooklyn Experimental Media Center.      The  Brooklyn Experimental Media Center (BxmC) is the research arm of Integrated Digital Media at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. BxmC provides an interdisciplinary environment for media research at the School of Engineering, partnering faculty and students from the Integrated Digital Media program with collaborators from the School of Engineering, NYU, Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), New York City, and beyond. Our research combines experimental practices in media arts and engineering, constantly modifying industry-standard technologies and creating new ones. The BxmC has a close relationship with the School of Engineering&#39;s Incubators &mdash;Varick St., DUMBO and NYC-ACRE&mdash;to provide students with opportunities for internships and startup development in the ever-growing NY tech-start up scene.
