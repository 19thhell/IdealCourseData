About    The International Education Program is part of the global mission of New York University to produce professionals who understand the international implications of their responsibilities and have the ability to utilize knowledge across international boundaries. Improved communications and transportation technologies, transnational business enterprise, the internationalization of popular consumer cultures, and the growth of multinational non-governmental organizations have all contributed to a world in which different nations are more interconnected than ever before.    As the social, political and economic systems of these different nations have become more interdependent, the problems they confront have assumed a global dimension, and cross cultural communication and exchange have become central to their solution. The International Education Program is dedicated to preparing professional educators who can work effectively in international and multinational settings.    The International Education Program sponsors a number of research and training projects through the Multinational Institute of American Studies, a center for public diplomacy that offers noncredit programs in American culture, politics, and society to foreign scholars, diplomats, and journalists. A student-led organization, the International Education Student Board, sponsors lectures and meetings on topics of current interest.    View our PDF brochure to learn more about the International Education program.    Degree Programs in International Education    The International Education program prepares educators for careers in multinational and international settings. The program develops educational experts who can design, implement, manage and evaluate international education programs in schools, colleges, foundations, multinational corporations, and public and private educational and cultural agencies. Guided by career interest, professional experience, and educational background, students may choose (but are not required) to select one of three specializations: global education; international development education/ education, conflict, and humanitarian action; and cross cultural exchange and training. The Program has a multidisciplinary faculty, consisting of anthropologists, economists, historians, philosophers, political scientists and sociologists, who apply the theoretical, conceptual and methodological advances in the humanities and the social sciences to the analysis of international educational policies and institutions.    No specific undergraduate major is required to gain admission to the Master of Arts program , but an applicant should have some course work in the social sciences and be able to demonstrate aptitude for analytic work on a range of issues in education. The M.A. program requires a minimum of 40 credits: Foundations in International Education (12 credits); Policy Analysis (8 credits); Internship (4 credits); and the remaining credits in Area Studies and Specialization in International Education.    The International Education Program offers a one-year Advanced Certificate for teachers and practitioners in the field of international education who already have the M.A. degree. The Advanced Certificate is designed for experienced teachers in schools and educational agencies committed to global education, and for mid career consultants and international education specialists in corporate, public, and nonprofit sectors, including field coordinators, planners, evaluators, administrators and program managers. The Advanced Certificate requires a minimum of 30 credits and can be completed in one year, consisting of two terms of full-time academic course work, and, for some students, the summer as well. This is a flexible program in which students, in addition to taking the basic courses in the Foundations of International Education (12 credits), may develop a concentration that links educational research to policy and practice and is of immediate practical use to them.    Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have an M.A. degree in an area of the humanities, social sciences or education related to international education, and they must take the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination. The Ph.D. degree requires the completion of a minimum of 54 credits and a dissertation: Foundations of Education (6 credits); Foundations in International Education (12 credits); International Education Doctoral Seminars (12 credits); Specialization in International Education (8-12credits); Area Studies (8-12 credits); Research Courses (6-12 points); Readings and Dissertation Seminars (0-12 points).    Students in the M.A. program participate in a job-related internship that provides professional work experience and reinforces academic skills. Internships may be arranged in the United States or abroad through such organizations as the United Nations, Institute for International Education, Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies, Metro International, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Hudson Institute, and the Asia Society.

This Global Network University model has emerged as a natural and logical extension of NYU\u2019s research and teaching agendas; flowing from our eco-systemic relation to New York City, the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs\u2014and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty. Students and faculty interact with their urban environment in countless meaningful and essential ways, using these locations as a major asset.   Students and faculty alike broaden the scope of vision and knowledge through international learning. Opportunities include study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming offered through the specific schools or departments. All locations within the network are also accessible for individual research that springs from individual academic ideas and goals.   Access to the World   NYU has never thought of itself as a gated community. It has always encouraged its students to think of themselves as participants in and shapers of a complex and changing environment. Indeed, part of NYU\u2019s teaching mission consists in preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and faculty at NYU believe that such preparation is most effective when the outside world is not held at bay. This same principle holds true as we create a Global Network University that is both \u201cin and of the city\u201d and \u201cin and of the world.\u201d   Our locations beyond our campus in New York City include NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, TischAsia in Singapore, NYU Law in Singapore, and 10 academic sites in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC.   Direct exchange programs with 12 distinguished partner institutions, 27 summer session locations, an ever-changing roster of intersession programming offered by NYU\u2019s various schools, colleges, and programs, and curriculum-driven initiatives expand the global network\u2014from Beijing to Johannesburg, Santiago to Vienna.   Around the world, students work closely with faculty and with their peers on shared commitments. They apply what they learn and develop the skills and qualities\u2014both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world.                                                      Study Abroad and Study Away International education is a long-standing part of New York University's global mission which includes a wide range of initiatives both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the exchange of knowledge across international boundaries.

Candidacy Examination    After completing most of their course work, students should file for the candidacy examination. The candidacy examination has two parts -- a three-hour written comprehensive and a two-hour oral session. The written part focuses on the basic literature covering modernization theory, cultural identity, nationalism, globalization, and socialization. The oral examination focuses on the major field of specialization in International Education (Global Education, International Development Education, or Cross Cultural Exchange and Training) and the area studies concentration. Students must also demonstrate competence in one of the following academic disciplines: anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, politics, or sociology. Students can use electives in their specialized field of international education and in their area studies concentration to satisfy this requirement. The oral examination is conducted by three professors, at least one of whom must be a specialist in the area studies concentration of the student. Prior to taking the examination each student must submit for approval a list of books for each part of the examination.    VIII. Specialized Research Methods (6-12 credits)    Students should develop competence in the research methods that they will use in their dissertation research. They should consult their advisor or dissertation chair in determining what methodological courses they need. Listed below are recommended courses offered by the Department of the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Students may also elect courses offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and some of these courses may satisfy the area studies concentration as well.

Non-credit Specialization Requirement    All students are required to pass a language examination related to the area studies in which she/he is concentrating.    X. Dissertation Committee    When a student has successfully completed the candidacy examination and has chosen a topic for research she/he will form a sponsoring committee by inviting three faculty members to supervise the writing of the dissertation. The chairperson must be selected from the full time faculty of the International Education program unless there is a compelling reason for another choice. At least one committee member must come from outside the International Education Program. In most cases at least one of the members of the committee is a specialist in the country or region in which the student has conducted his research. While preparing the dissertation students must enroll in a 1 credit course, HMSS-GE 3004, Dissertation Seminar III, to maintain matriculation; credits accumulated in this seminar do not count towards the completion of the degree.    XI. Final Oral Defense    After submitting the dissertation each student will defend the document before an examining commission of five faculty including the three sponsoring professors and two outside readers. The defense may include general areas of knowledge in the student's field of specialization as well as specific questions on the dissertation itself.    Total Credits    In general most students will be required to take at least 54 credits above the masters degree to fulfill the course work for the degree. In certain cases, the course requirements may be lowered if the student has taken the M.A. in International Education at NYU, or relevant graduate courses at other institutions within the last ten years, which have not been counted toward another degree.

The Program develops educational experts who can design, implement, manage and evaluate international education programs in schools, colleges, foundations, multinational corporations, and public and private educational and cultural agencies. Guided by career interest, professional experience, and educational background, students select from one of three areas of specialization: global education; international development education; cross cultural exchange and training. The Program has a multidisciplinary faculty, consisting of anthropologists, economists, historians, philosophers, political scientists and sociologists, who apply the theoretical, conceptual and methodological advances in the humanities and the social sciences to the analysis of international educational policies and institutions.    No specific undergraduate major is required to gain admission to the Master of Arts program , but an applicant should have some course work in the social sciences and be able to demonstrate aptitude for analytic work on a range of issues in education. The MA program requires a minimum of 40 credits: Foundations in International Education (12 credits); Policy Analysis (8 credits); Internship (4 credits); and the remaining credits in Area Studies and Specialization in International Education.    The International Education Program offers a one-year Advanced Certificate for teachers and practitioners in the field of international education who already have the MA degree. The Advanced Certificate is designed for experienced teachers in schools and educational agencies committed to global education, and for mid career consultants and international education specialists in corporate, public, and nonprofit sectors, including field coordinators, planners, evaluators, administrators and program managers. The Advanced Certificate requires a minimum of 30 credits and can be completed in one year, consisting of two terms of full-time academic course work, and, for some students, the summer as well. This is a flexible program in which students, in addition to taking the basic courses in the Foundations of International Education (12 credits), may develop a concentration that links educational research to policy and practice and is of immediate practical use to them.    Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have an MA degree in an area of the humanities, social sciences or education related to international education, and they must take the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination. The Ph.D. degree requires the completion of a minimum of 54 credits and a dissertation: Foundations of Education (6 credits); Foundations in International Education (12 credits); International Education Doctoral Seminars (12 credits); Specialization in International Education (8-12credits); Area Studies (8-12 credits); Research Courses (6-12 points); Readings and Dissertation Seminars (0-12 points).    Students in the MA program participate in a job-related internship that provides professional work experience and reinforces academic skills. Internships may be arranged in the United States or abroad through such organizations as the United Nations, the Institute for International Education, Metro International, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Hudson Institute, and the Asia Society.

The International Education program hosts a panel about girls' education, September 19th, 2014.       About    The International Education Program is part of the global mission of New York University to produce professionals who understand the international implications of their responsibilities and have the ability to utilize knowledge across international boundaries. Improved communications and transportation technologies, transnational business enterprise, the internationalization of popular consumer cultures, and the growth of multinational non-governmental organizations have all contributed to a world in which different nations are more interconnected than ever before.    As the social, political and economic systems of these different nations have become more interdependent, the problems they confront have assumed a global dimension, and cross cultural communication and exchange have become central to their solution. The International Education Program is dedicated to preparing professional educators who can work effectively in international and multinational settings.    The International Education Program sponsors a number of research and training projects through the Multinational Institute of American Studies, a center for public diplomacy that offers noncredit programs in American culture, politics, and society to foreign scholars, diplomats, and journalists. A student-led organization, the International Education Student Board, sponsors lectures and meetings on topics of current interest.    View our PDF brochure to learn more about the International Education program.    Degree Programs in International Education    The International Education program prepares educators for careers in multinational and international settings. The program develops educational experts who can design, implement, manage and evaluate international education programs in schools, colleges, foundations, multinational corporations, and public and private educational and cultural agencies. Guided by career interest, professional experience, and educational background, students may choose (but are not required) to select one of three specializations: global education; international development education/ education, conflict, and humanitarian action; and cross cultural exchange and training. The Program has a multidisciplinary faculty, consisting of anthropologists, economists, historians, philosophers, political scientists and sociologists, who apply the theoretical, conceptual and methodological advances in the humanities and the social sciences to the analysis of international educational policies and institutions.    No specific undergraduate major is required to gain admission to the Master of Arts program , but an applicant should have some course work in the social sciences and be able to demonstrate aptitude for analytic work on a range of issues in education. The M.A. program requires a minimum of 40 credits: Foundations in International Education (12 credits); Policy Analysis (8 credits); Internship (4 credits); and the remaining credits in Area Studies and Specialization in International Education.    The International Education Program offers a one-year Advanced Certificate for teachers and practitioners in the field of international education who already have the M.A. degree. The Advanced Certificate is designed for experienced teachers in schools and educational agencies committed to global education, and for mid career consultants and international education specialists in corporate, public, and nonprofit sectors, including field coordinators, planners, evaluators, administrators and program managers. The Advanced Certificate requires a minimum of 30 credits and can be completed in one year, consisting of two terms of full-time academic course work, and, for some students, the summer as well. This is a flexible program in which students, in addition to taking the basic courses in the Foundations of International Education (12 credits), may develop a concentration that links educational research to policy and practice and is of immediate practical use to them.    Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have an M.A. degree in an area of the humanities, social sciences or education related to international education, and they must take the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination. The Ph.D. degree requires the completion of a minimum of 54 credits and a dissertation: Foundations of Education (6 credits); Foundations in International Education (12 credits); International Education Doctoral Seminars (12 credits); Specialization in International Education (8-12credits); Area Studies (8-12 credits); Research Courses (6-12 points); Readings and Dissertation Seminars (0-12 points).    Students in the M.A. program participate in a job-related internship that provides professional work experience and reinforces academic skills. Internships may be arranged in the United States or abroad through such organizations as the United Nations, Institute for International Education, Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies, Metro International, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Hudson Institute, and the Asia Society.

The Program develops educational experts who can design, implement, manage and evaluate international education programs in schools, colleges, foundations, multinational corporations, and public and private educational and cultural agencies. Guided by career interest, professional experience, and educational background, students select from one of three areas of specialization: global education; international development education; cross cultural exchange and training. The Program has a multidisciplinary faculty, consisting of anthropologists, economists, historians, philosophers, political scientists and sociologists, who apply the theoretical, conceptual and methodological advances in the humanities and the social sciences to the analysis of international educational policies and institutions.    No specific undergraduate major is required to gain admission to the Master of Arts program , but an applicant should have some course work in the social sciences and be able to demonstrate aptitude for analytic work on a range of issues in education. The MA program requires a minimum of 40 credits: Foundations in International Education (12 credits); Policy Analysis (8 credits); Internship (4 credits); and the remaining credits in Area Studies and Specialization in International Education.    The International Education Program offers a one-year Advanced Certificate for teachers and practitioners in the field of international education who already have the MA degree. The Advanced Certificate is designed for experienced teachers in schools and educational agencies committed to global education, and for mid career consultants and international education specialists in corporate, public, and nonprofit sectors, including field coordinators, planners, evaluators, administrators and program managers. The Advanced Certificate requires a minimum of 30 credits and can be completed in one year, consisting of two terms of full-time academic course work, and, for some students, the summer as well. This is a flexible program in which students, in addition to taking the basic courses in the Foundations of International Education (12 credits), may develop a concentration that links educational research to policy and practice and is of immediate practical use to them.    Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have an MA degree in an area of the humanities, social sciences or education related to international education, and they must take the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination. The Ph.D. degree requires the completion of a minimum of 54 credits and a dissertation: Foundations of Education (6 credits); Foundations in International Education (12 credits); International Education Doctoral Seminars (12 credits); Specialization in International Education (8-12credits); Area Studies (8-12 credits); Research Courses (6-12 points); Readings and Dissertation Seminars (0-12 points).    Students in the MA program participate in a job-related internship that provides professional work experience and reinforces academic skills. Internships may be arranged in the United States or abroad through such organizations as the United Nations, the Institute for International Education, Metro International, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Hudson Institute, and the Asia Society.

The International Education program hosts a panel about girls' education, September 19th, 2014.       About    The International Education Program is part of the global mission of New York University to produce professionals who understand the international implications of their responsibilities and have the ability to utilize knowledge across international boundaries. Improved communications and transportation technologies, transnational business enterprise, the internationalization of popular consumer cultures, and the growth of multinational non-governmental organizations have all contributed to a world in which different nations are more interconnected than ever before.    As the social, political and economic systems of these different nations have become more interdependent, the problems they confront have assumed a global dimension, and cross cultural communication and exchange have become central to their solution. The International Education Program is dedicated to preparing professional educators who can work effectively in international and multinational settings.    The International Education Program sponsors a number of research and training projects through the Multinational Institute of American Studies, a center for public diplomacy that offers noncredit programs in American culture, politics, and society to foreign scholars, diplomats, and journalists. A student-led organization, the International Education Student Board, sponsors lectures and meetings on topics of current interest.

They can be taken for credit multiple times.       HMSS-GE 3002 Doctoral Seminar I (3-6 credits)    HMSS-GE 3003 Doctoral Seminar II (3-6 credits)       VII. Candidacy Examination    After completing most of their course work, students should file for the candidacy examination. The candidacy examination has two parts -- a three-hour written comprehensive and a two-hour oral session. The written part focuses on the basic literature covering modernization theory, cultural identity, nationalism, globalization, and socialization. The oral examination focuses on the major field of specialization in International Education (Global Education, International Development Education, or Cross Cultural Exchange and Training) and the area studies concentration. Students must also demonstrate competence in one of the following academic disciplines: anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, politics, or sociology. Students can use electives in their specialized field of international education and in their area studies concentration to satisfy this requirement. The oral examination is conducted by three professors, at least one of whom must be a specialist in the area studies concentration of the student. Prior to taking the examination each student must submit for approval a list of books for each part of the examination.    VIII. Specialized Research Methods (6-12 credits)    Students should develop competence in the research methods that they will use in their dissertation research. They should consult their advisor or dissertation chair in determining what methodological courses they need. Listed below are recommended courses offered by the Department of the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Students may also elect courses offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and some of these courses may satisfy the area studies concentration as well.

Non-credit Specialization Requirement    All students are required to pass a language examination related to the area studies in which she/he is concentrating.    X. Dissertation Committee    When a student has successfully completed the candidacy examination and has chosen a topic for research she/he will form a sponsoring committee by inviting three faculty members to supervise the writing of the dissertation. The chairperson must be selected from the full time faculty of the International Education program unless there is a compelling reason for another choice. At least one committee member must come from outside the International Education Program. In most cases at least one of the members of the committee is a specialist in the country or region in which the student has conducted his research. While preparing the dissertation students must enroll in a 1 credit course, HMSS-GE 3004, Dissertation Seminar III, to maintain matriculation; credits accumulated in this seminar do not count towards the completion of the degree.    XI. Final Oral Defense    After submitting the dissertation each student will defend the document before an examining commission of five faculty including the three sponsoring professors and two outside readers. The defense may include general areas of knowledge in the student's field of specialization as well as specific questions on the dissertation itself.    Total Credits    In general most students will be required to take at least 54 credits above the masters degree to fulfill the course work for the degree. In certain cases, the course requirements may be lowered if the student has taken the M.A. in International Education at NYU, or relevant graduate courses at other institutions within the last ten years, which have not been counted toward another degree.
