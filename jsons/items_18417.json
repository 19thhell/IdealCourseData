In choosing the right school, students must carefully consider many factors. Here are a few of the elements you might consider in evaluating if NYU Wagner is the right fit for you:   Programs &amp; Faculty   Customizing Your Program   The Value of a NYU Wagner degree   Part-time &amp; Full-time Options   The Student Body   How Long Does It Take to Finish?   Programs &amp; Faculty   NYU Wagner is dedicated to preparing students to address the serious issues facing society today. The academic programs emphasize a mix of theory and practice, so that students can build a portfolio based on their curriculum and real-world experience in their specific area of interest. Our programs also take a multifaceted approach, one that crosses boundaries by design. Locating specific programs in a general school of public service exposes students to a broad curriculum, facilitating nuanced views often lacking from narrower approaches.   Please use the following links to explore NYU Wagner's various degree programs, including requirements, sample schedules, course descriptions and more.   Master of Public Administration \u2013 Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy   Master of Public Administration \u2013 Health Policy and Management   Master of Urban Planning   Ph.D. in Public Administration   Executive Master of Public Administration   Advanced Certificate   Other: Non-degree and undergraduate offerings   A faculty's \u00a0interests can be an important deciding factor when choosing a program. At NYU Wagner, our faculty is diverse, active and accessible. They are as dedicated to making a difference in their field as they are to their students.   The Wagner faculty is composed of a blend of full-time , \u00a0 clinical/research/visiting \u00a0and adjunct professors . We have 38 full-time, clinical/research/visiting faculty members who come from a variety of disciplines, including economics, finance, sociology, political science, law, and planning. Faculty focus on issues that are important to our local and global community, such as international development, housing, health care, arts and education. Both domestically and globally, their research examines issues of public importance with an eye to making a difference.   Our adjunct professors bring a different element to the classroom: real-world experience. They are the consultants, policy analysts, policy makers, directors and researchers who are changing the shape of public service through their practice. They hold senior level positions at places like the United Nations, the City of New York, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute, Foreign Policy in Focus Think Tank, Safe Horizon, Interhemispheric Resource Center and the National Institute for Dispute Resolution.   Back to Top   Customizing Your Program   While all NYU Wagner students must take required core courses, NYU and the Robert F. Wagner School encourage an interdisciplinary approach to learning, so that students may fine-tune their curriculum in order to meet their specific interests and needs. They may focus on a particular area in class projects and take courses across programs and schools. Students may take classes in any NYU graduate school, including the NYU School of Law , Stern School of Business , Steinhardt School of Education ,\u00a0 NYU Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , Shirley M. Ehrenkranz School of Social Work , and Tisch School of the Arts .   Back to Top   The Value of a NYU Wagner Degree   Within the MPA degree tracks, a student may specialize in management of public and nonprofit organizations, financial management and public finance or public policy analysis. The MPA in Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy with a specialization in policy is generally comparable to a Masters in Public Policy degree taken at another institution. Wagner students have the added option of pursuing much more focused study in finance or management than students pursuing an MPP.   Many programs in health policy and management are housed within schools of public health (awarding the MPH) or schools of business (awarding the MHA or MBA). Basically, the course content for a MPA will be comparable for degrees awarded at business schools, however the Wagner School's focus on nonprofit and public institutions will provide a different grounding from a traditional business perspective. While business programs tend to focus on stock market issues, for example, Wagner's health program focuses on understanding the health care system and how management techniques relate directly to that system.   A traditional MPH curriculum will differ from ours mainly in its primary starting point, which is the study of the spread and containment of disease. While epidemiology is the groundwork for the MPH; management, finance and policy analysis ground Wagner's MPA degree focus.   NYU Wagner offers an international specialization. Within the specialization, students will gain a solid understanding of policy analysis, management or finance, and may choose to concentrate on one of these areas. A student who wishes to pursue an international career path following graduation will find that these sets of skills will prepare them well for a variety of settings. An international specialization combined with internships and study abroad can provide a healthy international perspective.   The international specialization is now offered in all three of our two-year degree programs: MPA in Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy, MPA in Health Policy and Management, and Master of Urban Planning. One of the school's curriculum initiatives involves the creation of new and expanded offerings in the area of international development policy and administration. In addition, NYU Wagner also offers an Executive MPA degree focusing on managing international public service organizations. Intended for professionals wishing to hone their skills, this Executive MPA program was launched in the spring 2000 semester.

Students are permitted to switch their status at any time throughout their Wagner education, and the same programs and curriculum applies to both full-time and part-time students. Because some students want the option of working full-time, NYU Wagner offers numerous classes in the evening, but part-time students should expect to take at least one course that begins at 4:55 p.m., which might require an adjustment to a work schedule. Most full-time students also hold part-time jobs or internships. Since the Wagner School emphasizes a blend of theory and practice, we feel that jobs and internships held while at Wagner are essential to enrich the learning experience   Back to Top   The Student Body   The student population is rich with diversity and experience. At NYU Wagner, we embrace this diversity as an essential component of our commitment to public service. Better solutions to public issues, we believe, are found by joining people from different backgrounds. Students are able to take classes, work together, discuss issues and solve problems in groups that reflect the multicultural composition of communities of the future, and of cities like New York today.  Our students stay active in the community and the school through events hosted by our many Wagner student groups .   Back to Top   Wagner's International Students   Wagner's international students currently come from: Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Ghana, India, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Myanmar, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, P R China, Philippines, Poland, Republic Of Korea, Russia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.   Back to Top   How Long Does it Take To Finish?   The length of time required to finish a degree is dependent upon how many credits a student takes each semester. The academic year consists of a fall and spring semester. In addition, students, unless required, have the option of taking summer courses. Taking summer courses may speed along the completion of coursework, however, depending on the degree program it may not shorten the length of time necessary to complete the degree.   Generally, full-time students take 12\u00a0credits (4 courses) each semester while part-time students take 6-9\u00a0credits (2-3\u00a0courses).

The main research in the department in carried out through 4 laboratories: the Applied Dynamics and Optimization Laboratory, the Mechatronics Laboratory, Composite Materials and Mechanics Laboratory, and the Dynamical Systems Laboratory . The labs concentrate on research related to the development, deployment, and utilization of advanced biomimetic smart systems and materials, and electromechanical systems.   Educating Tomorrow&rsquo;s Engineers   Our programs offer students diverse and multidimensional education that addresses fundamental understanding of the underlying mathematics, sciences, and engineering; design methodologies; use of modern simulation and design tools; and extensive laboratories for undergraduate and graduate instruction and research.   Our mission is to prepare students for careers in mechanical and related engineering disciplines for professional development, life-long learning, and contributions to society.   We seek to add value to our students&rsquo; career potential by placing an emphasis on (a) understanding the physical world through project, tools, and practice; and (b) providing the foundation tools for innovation, invention and entrepreneurship.   The department offers BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering. It also offers an Minor in Aerospace Engineering and an Interdisciplinary Minor in Nuclear science and Engineering.   The Profession   Mechanical engineering is a dynamic and continually evolving profession and the most diverse among all engineering disciplines. Mechanical engineers develop the physical systems and devices that modern society needs or wants, from automobiles to air conditioning, robots to power plants, people movers to artificial limbs and rocket engines to communications satellites.   Mechanical engineering also has a long tradition of leadership in helping to develop the natural environment by breaking new ground in such areas as resource conservation, improved efficiency of energy-consuming devices, development of codes for a safer technological environment, new energy sources and the like.   Undergraduate and graduate programs in mechanical engineering are designed primarily to develop talents in such areas as design of components, fluid and thermal systems, controls and robotic systems and computer-integrated mechanical and electromechanical systems. However, many graduating students eventually apply their training to the additional diversified fields of computer engineering, nanotechnology, software development, financial engineering, bioengineering, manufacturing, astronautics, systems engineering and corporate management and law. As students mature and realize their abilities, their professional lives may center on engineering research, government, business or education.   Department History   The history of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department can be traced to 1899 when Polytechnic established its original Mechanical Engineering Department. In 1931, it began offering its first classes in aeronautical engineering: Airplane Designs and Aerodynamics, and Airplane Structures.

In choosing the right school, students must carefully consider many factors. Here are a few of the elements you might consider in evaluating if NYU Wagner is the right fit for you:   Programs &amp; Faculty   Customizing Your Program   The Value of a NYU Wagner degree   Part-time &amp; Full-time Options   The Student Body   How Long Does It Take to Finish?   Programs &amp; Faculty   NYU Wagner is dedicated to preparing students to address the serious issues facing society today. The academic programs emphasize a mix of theory and practice, so that students can build a portfolio based on their curriculum and real-world experience in their specific area of interest. Our programs also take a multifaceted approach, one that crosses boundaries by design. Locating specific programs in a general school of public service exposes students to a broad curriculum, facilitating nuanced views often lacking from narrower approaches.   Please use the following links to explore NYU Wagner's various degree programs, including requirements, sample schedules, course descriptions and more.   Master of Public Administration \u2013 Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy   Master of Public Administration \u2013 Health Policy and Management   Master of Urban Planning   Ph.D. in Public Administration   Executive Master of Public Administration   Advanced Certificate   Other: Non-degree and undergraduate offerings   A faculty's \u00a0interests can be an important deciding factor when choosing a program. At NYU Wagner, our faculty is diverse, active and accessible. They are as dedicated to making a difference in their field as they are to their students.   The Wagner faculty is composed of a blend of full-time , \u00a0 clinical/research/visiting \u00a0and adjunct professors . We have 38 full-time, clinical/research/visiting faculty members who come from a variety of disciplines, including economics, finance, sociology, political science, law, and planning. Faculty focus on issues that are important to our local and global community, such as international development, housing, health care, arts and education. Both domestically and globally, their research examines issues of public importance with an eye to making a difference.   Our adjunct professors bring a different element to the classroom: real-world experience. They are the consultants, policy analysts, policy makers, directors and researchers who are changing the shape of public service through their practice. They hold senior level positions at places like the United Nations, the City of New York, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute, Foreign Policy in Focus Think Tank, Safe Horizon, Interhemispheric Resource Center and the National Institute for Dispute Resolution.   Back to Top   Customizing Your Program   While all NYU Wagner students must take required core courses, NYU and the Robert F. Wagner School encourage an interdisciplinary approach to learning, so that students may fine-tune their curriculum in order to meet their specific interests and needs. They may focus on a particular area in class projects and take courses across programs and schools. Students may take classes in any NYU graduate school, including the NYU School of Law , Stern School of Business , Steinhardt School of Education ,\u00a0 NYU Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , Shirley M. Ehrenkranz School of Social Work , and Tisch School of the Arts .   Back to Top   The Value of a NYU Wagner Degree   Within the MPA degree tracks, a student may specialize in management of public and nonprofit organizations, financial management and public finance or public policy analysis. The MPA in Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy with a specialization in policy is generally comparable to a Masters in Public Policy degree taken at another institution. Wagner students have the added option of pursuing much more focused study in finance or management than students pursuing an MPP.   Many programs in health policy and management are housed within schools of public health (awarding the MPH) or schools of business (awarding the MHA or MBA). Basically, the course content for a MPA will be comparable for degrees awarded at business schools, however the Wagner School's focus on nonprofit and public institutions will provide a different grounding from a traditional business perspective. While business programs tend to focus on stock market issues, for example, Wagner's health program focuses on understanding the health care system and how management techniques relate directly to that system.   A traditional MPH curriculum will differ from ours mainly in its primary starting point, which is the study of the spread and containment of disease. While epidemiology is the groundwork for the MPH; management, finance and policy analysis ground Wagner's MPA degree focus.   NYU Wagner offers an international specialization. Within the specialization, students will gain a solid understanding of policy analysis, management or finance, and may choose to concentrate on one of these areas. A student who wishes to pursue an international career path following graduation will find that these sets of skills will prepare them well for a variety of settings. An international specialization combined with internships and study abroad can provide a healthy international perspective.   The international specialization is now offered in all three of our two-year degree programs: MPA in Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy, MPA in Health Policy and Management, and Master of Urban Planning. One of the school's curriculum initiatives involves the creation of new and expanded offerings in the area of international development policy and administration. In addition, NYU Wagner also offers an Executive MPA degree focusing on managing international public service organizations. Intended for professionals wishing to hone their skills, this Executive MPA program was launched in the spring 2000 semester.

Students are permitted to switch their status at any time throughout their Wagner education, and the same programs and curriculum applies to both full-time and part-time students. Because some students want the option of working full-time, NYU Wagner offers numerous classes in the evening, but part-time students should expect to take at least one course that begins at 4:55 p.m., which might require an adjustment to a work schedule. Most full-time students also hold part-time jobs or internships. Since the Wagner School emphasizes a blend of theory and practice, we feel that jobs and internships held while at Wagner are essential to enrich the learning experience   Back to Top   The Student Body   The student population is rich with diversity and experience. At NYU Wagner, we embrace this diversity as an essential component of our commitment to public service. Better solutions to public issues, we believe, are found by joining people from different backgrounds. Students are able to take classes, work together, discuss issues and solve problems in groups that reflect the multicultural composition of communities of the future, and of cities like New York today.  Our students stay active in the community and the school through events hosted by our many Wagner student groups .   Back to Top   Wagner's International Students   Wagner's international students currently come from: Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Ghana, India, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Myanmar, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, P R China, Philippines, Poland, Republic Of Korea, Russia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.   Back to Top   How Long Does it Take To Finish?   The length of time required to finish a degree is dependent upon how many credits a student takes each semester. The academic year consists of a fall and spring semester. In addition, students, unless required, have the option of taking summer courses. Taking summer courses may speed along the completion of coursework, however, depending on the degree program it may not shorten the length of time necessary to complete the degree.   Generally, full-time students take 12\u00a0credits (4 courses) each semester while part-time students take 6-9\u00a0credits (2-3\u00a0courses). Below is an estimated time frame for completing the various degree programs offered at NYU Wagner:     Degree   Full-Time   Part-Time   MPA or MUP   2 years*   3-4 years   PhD   4-5 years   n/a   EMPA   1-1.5 years   2-3 years   Advanced Professional Certificate   1 year   1+years   BA/MPA or BA/MUP   5 years (4 undergraduate &amp; 1 graduate)   6 years (4 undergraduate &amp; 2 graduate)   JD/MPA or JD/MUP   4 years   n/a   MBA/MPA   3 years   n/a   MSW/EMPA   2 years including summers   3+years   MD/MPA(MD portion is full time only   5 years including summers   n/a   *Students who enter the MPA or MUP program in the Spring semester will require an extra semester to complete the degree due to the timing of the Capstone class .

The main research in the department in carried out through 4 laboratories: the Applied Dynamics and Optimization Laboratory, the Mechatronics Laboratory, Composite Materials and Mechanics Laboratory, and the Dynamical Systems Laboratory . The labs concentrate on research related to the development, deployment, and utilization of advanced biomimetic smart systems and materials, and electromechanical systems.   Educating Tomorrow&rsquo;s Engineers   Our programs offer students diverse and multidimensional education that addresses fundamental understanding of the underlying mathematics, sciences, and engineering; design methodologies; use of modern simulation and design tools; and extensive laboratories for undergraduate and graduate instruction and research.   Our mission is to prepare students for careers in mechanical and related engineering disciplines for professional development, life-long learning, and contributions to society.   We seek to add value to our students&rsquo; career potential by placing an emphasis on (a) understanding the physical world through project, tools, and practice; and (b) providing the foundation tools for innovation, invention and entrepreneurship.   The department offers BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering. It also offers an Minor in Aerospace Engineering and an Interdisciplinary Minor in Nuclear science and Engineering.   The Profession   Mechanical engineering is a dynamic and continually evolving profession and the most diverse among all engineering disciplines. Mechanical engineers develop the physical systems and devices that modern society needs or wants, from automobiles to air conditioning, robots to power plants, people movers to artificial limbs and rocket engines to communications satellites.   Mechanical engineering also has a long tradition of leadership in helping to develop the natural environment by breaking new ground in such areas as resource conservation, improved efficiency of energy-consuming devices, development of codes for a safer technological environment, new energy sources and the like.   Undergraduate and graduate programs in mechanical engineering are designed primarily to develop talents in such areas as design of components, fluid and thermal systems, controls and robotic systems and computer-integrated mechanical and electromechanical systems.
