You can find details on the major and advisement below. Please read it and the FAQs closely, as most common questions are addressed. If you are interested in Environmental Studies, please take ENVST-UA 100 and ENVST-UA 101 as early as possible, to get a sense of the major and an introduction to the field of environmental studies. ENVST-UA 100 is offered every fall and summer; ENVST-UA 101 is offered every spring and summer. You can take certain electives before taking ENVST-UA 100 and 101. They are listed on our course page . You can also take ENVST classes abroad. Visit our abroad page for details.  This link gives you information about Withdrawal Schedules, Cross School   Registration, Minor Application, and Final Exam Schedules. In addition to ENVST-UA 100 and ENVST-UA 101, there are two core classes for the major, ENVST-UA 800 and ENVST-UA 900. The internship is a junior-year requirement. You can find details on it, as well as a listing of sites, at this link . You will gain access to the secure page after declaring your major. Once you register for the internship, we will contact you with further details and instructions. The capstone is an integrative, problem based, project-oriented courses for senior Environmental Studies students. They require self-initiated, collaborative, interdisciplinary and integrative student work. The capstone entails students working for a client (actual or hypothetical), and using an applied approach to learning. Students work collaboratively on a current environmental problem, including characterizing the problem, analyzing possible solutions, implementing some solutions, and publicly presenting the results. You can find more detail at this link . The Department of Environmental Studies hosts regular open houses and workshops about careers in ES. You can find more detail at this link . Your adviser will also contact you about career events each spring. The secure blog also lists jobs, paid internships, graduate school advice, funding opportunities, events, scholarships, and other important information. Information on alumni can be found here .
