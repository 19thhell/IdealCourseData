NYU COMMON APPLICATION: All applicants must complete New York University's Application for Undergraduate Admission and provide the required academic documentation and supporting credentials. The application may be obtained from the NYU Undergraduate Admissions web site . Deadlines for portfolio submission are scheduled according to the NYU undergraduate application deadlines: November 1st for Early Decision Applicants January 1st for Early Decision II Applicants\u2028 January 1st for Regular Decision Applicants \u2028March 1st for Internal Transfer Applicants \u2028April 1st for Non-NYU Transfer Applicants.  Creative materials will only be accepted through tischphoto.slideroom.com . Portfolio Requirements for Fall 2015 Applicants. I) PORTFOLIO: Submit 15 -20 images via SlideRoom.com 10 images should be on a single theme. Title or caption each of your images. Include a brief description with the medium/format (analog, digital, etc.) and indicate which 10 images are within the single theme. You will be asked to explain your chosen series in your written statement. Sequence your work to effectively communicate your ideas. Your portfolio should be a cohesive body of work that reveals your passion, effort, and most importantly your point of view. We look for diversity in student thinking, experience, and media presentation. Effective development of meaningful content is of particular importance. The portfolio assignment requests images on a single theme, but this should not limit you to submitting work from a single photo shoot or a single roll of film. Take time to review our suggestions for generating portfolio content and consider the myriad ways you can approach your selected theme. We accept submission of new and interactive media based work, sound and video art. You may include up to 5 non-photo based images (fine art, drawing, etc.), but if you choose to do so, you must submit a total of 20 images.  Tips For Developing a Portfolio (for New York University)  Avoid compiling a disjointed group of images that are intended to be considered individually. A large variety of photographs that show a sampling of every genre and technique often appear incoherent or lacking in vision. When selecting the content for your portfolio, include images that expand on the same theme (or a series of themes and ideas) rather than images that are thematically unrelated. Sequence your work so that the images flow and relate to one another in a thematic and visual way Consider what the work tells the viewer about you. The Department of Photography &amp; Imaging does not have access to your common application and will never get to read your personal essay. How you can convey this information visually? Your portfolio is an opportunity to share your opinions, passion for ideas, and personal vision of the world with your viewer.  Suggestions for Generating Portfolio Content Create from your passion and embrace the fact that personal passion is subjective. You may find inspiration exploring something you absolutely love or you may feel driven to create work in response to something you find unjust, unpleasant or reprehensible. Any theme can be worthy of exploration. Show us what evokes your excitement to create images.  For inspiration, see photography/art exhibitions, and movies. Read literature, poetry. In short, seek out media that excites your creativity. Try to understand what makes this work engaging and coherent. Keep a journal of ideas for image-making Ask yourself what elements to add to the images so that other possibilities can be explored and developed, expanding the boundaries of your idea. Ask others for critical feedback Accept critical feedback  II) SHORT ESSAYS: Four responses, 100 words or less per question, to the following: 1. Introduce yourself.  You may write something or include the link to a video of 30 seconds or less. 2. Statement Write a brief statement about your submitted work. Discuss the primary issue that you want to discuss in your images and include what drives you to make your work. Please also explain your response to the assignment. 3. Describe a photograph or photographer that you consistently return to view and explain how this photograph or image engages you. 4. In your opinion, what does it mean to make photo/image-based art in the 21st Century? III) QUESTIONNAIRE: List the photography, digital imaging, art and art history courses, if any, that you have taken at your high school and/or college. Briefly list your photography and imaging skills. Do you have any other experience relating to your image-making work that you'd like to share? If you have a website or blog you would like to share, please include the URL. Your portfolio must be submitted through tischphoto.slideroom.com .
