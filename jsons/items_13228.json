Who do I contact with more specific inquiries about the master&rsquo;s program?                                  Questions about the I/O Program      Does the I/O program have any connections to the MBA program?     We do not have a formalized joint degree with the business school (Stern), but students may take related electives there. Courses like &ldquo;Managing Organizations&rdquo;, or Consumer Behavior can be used as electives.\u00a0 Please note that Stern must approve all enrollments and space may be limited.      Is there a significant difference between the General M.A. and I/O M.A. programs?     Yes. The two programs differ greatly in admissions criteria, course structure, and expected outcomes. The I/O program is much smaller and more selective. The applications are similar, but an extra case study is required for I/O admission.      How important are quantitative skills? Will I have to do research and use statistics frequently in my I/O coursework?     Quantitative skills are very important. You must be competent and technically proficient in statistics for the program, especially for advanced electives.      Do students work or have internships while in the I/O program?     Many students enter the program as current members of the workforce and maintain their jobs. Other students find jobs or internships, usually part-time, while taking classes along the way. While it is strongly recommended to do so in order to gain valuable applied experience to supplement material learned in class, working or completing an internship is not mandatory.      What are the I/O classes like?     While each class is unique, most classes strive to allow you to merge science and applied work. The structure of each class is designed to best facilitate comprehension and execution of the material. Class work includes casework, discussion, lectures, external projects, and individual and group presentations.      What is the average I/O class size?     Classes range from 10 students to the low 20s, with an average of about 16.      What is the ODA?     The Organizational Development Association is the official student and alumni organization for the I/O program at NYU, and it seeks to create a bridge between the classroom and the workplace. We are a community dedicated to building essential skills for successful I/O careers through professional development and networking. The ODA offers students an opportunity to be a functional part of an organization in a learning environment. Leadership roles are available for both new and existing members through managing events and projects related to the ODA&rsquo;s mission.      What are the I/O comprehensive exams like?     To complete the program, students must either take a comprehensive exam or write a thesis. The Comprehensive Exam is the most common choice of the MA I/O program students as the culmination of their work in the program, due to the applied focus of the program. The test requires answering three case-study type questions: one from the Industrial (I) branch, one from the Organizational (O) branch, and one from the Research Methods (R) branch. One hour is allotted for each question. Answers are rated by multiple faculty members based on comprehensiveness, use of I/O theory, and realistic applicability.      How is the I/O program at NYU different than other I/O Master&rsquo;s programs?       NYU offers a balanced Master&rsquo;s program in this field, hitting both the Industrial and the Organizational aspects evenly and stressing the importance of each. NYU also offers a high-caliber, personal experience made possible by the small number of select applicants accepted in each cohort. NYU&rsquo;s schedule encourages students to develop their professional careers while pursuing their degree. Ideally, upon completion of an MA from NYU&rsquo;s program, a graduate can enter an organization in a management position.      How long does it take to complete the I/O Master&rsquo;s program?     Many students complete the program in two calendar years, but some many need more time to complete their thesis or comprehensive exams. Much depends on the working status of the student against the progression of coursework and program completion. Students have anywhere from 2 to 5 years.      Can I work while I&rsquo;m enrolled in the I/O program?     Yes. All master&rsquo;s courses are offered in the evening on weekdays (usually at 4:20 and 6:20), so many students have day jobs while they are in the program. Organizations may be able to help with support through tuition remission programs.      I just want to take a few I/O classes. Do I still need to apply?     There is no I/O non-degree status.\u00a0 To take I/O courses, you must be enrolled as a degree-seeking I/O student, meaning you must apply to the program.                              Academics and Calendar       When does each semester begin?    The fall term usually begins in early September, the spring semester begins in late January, and summer session begins in late May. For more specific dates, consult the university calendar at: http://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/academic-calendar.html    How many classes can or should I take every semester?    Students are considered full-time when taking three courses (9 credits). \u00a0However, if you&rsquo;re working at the same time, it is recommended that you take fewer courses.                     Visiting the Campus    How can I take a campus tour?    We offer two virtual tours of our campus. One tour is an interactive map of the campus: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/gsas.admissions.virtualtour . The second virtual option is a narrated video highlighting some of the most commonly visited buildings on the Washington Square Campus: http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/visit-us/virtual-tour.html .    At this time the Graduate School of Arts and Science is not hosting in-person guided tours. However, if you decide to visit campus in person, you may use the virtual tour map as a guide. Please note that you are not able to enter most NYU buildings without an NYU ID card.    Please note that the Psychology building is a high security building and you will not be able to walk around the building or see any classrooms.    Can I make a personal appointment to meet with an advisor?    Due to the high volume of applications we receive each term (hundreds), demand far outweighs our capacity to meet with students before they are accepted into our program. As an alternative, we suggest that interested students attend one of our open house sessions , where they can meet with the director of the program and ask questions.    Can I sit in on a class?    Unfortunately, no. We have a small program that is quite interactive. We do not allow any visitors in courses as it can be disruptive to the learning process. As an alternative, we suggest that interested students attend one of our open house sessions, which can provide you with more targeted information, and allow you to ask questions to the director to the program. Please visit http://psych.nyu.edu/programs/ma/openhouse.html for the schedule of upcoming open houses.                     Application and Admissions            Where can I access the application?         http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.admissions.onlineapp           Does my undergraduate major have to be psychology in order to apply to the program?    No, we accept students from all concentrations. However, we do require that applicants have completed two courses by the time they apply to the program: an introductory psychology course and a statistics course.    Can I take my prerequisites at NYU? Where else can I take them?    The prerequisite courses can be taken at any accredited university. We accept credits from online schools, but only those that are accredited. To take prerequisites at NYU, you will need to apply as a non-degree student. However, we find online courses to be an acceptable and more accessible alternative. To satisfy a prerequisite, an online course must be affiliated with a University that has a physical campus. For example, we have found the online courses from the University of Colorado at Boulder to be acceptable: http://conted.colorado.edu/programs/independent-learning/courses/self/Psychology%20and%20Neuroscience/5178/independent-learning/?department_id=31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31    What is the undergraduate GPA requirement to apply?    We consider a competitive GPA to be a 3.0 (B). If your GPA is lower than this because of courses unrelated to psychology, such as pre-med courses, this requirement might be relaxed.    Is the reputation of my university taken into consideration during the application process?    The admissions committee recognizes the academic rigor of many universities, but undergraduate institution alone does not provide enough information to accept or deny an applicant.    Is research/work experience in the psychology field required for application?    Neither research nor employment in the field of psychology is a required part of the application. However, experience in psychology absolutely makes an application more competitive for the I/O program.    Who should I ask to write my recommendation letters?    Someone who knows you well academically is best, but professional supervisors are also acceptable. If possible, at least one academic reference is preferable.    Can I request to defer my acceptance?    Although applicants may request a deferral for one semester (not two), unless there is a substantial reason to delay for a semester, it may not necessarily be granted.\u00a0 To do so, you must officially accept the offer of admission, submit your tuition deposit, and request the deferral from the graduate school by emailing gsas.admissions@nyu.edu.    If I am not accepted to the PhD program, can I use the same application for the master&rsquo;s program?    Yes. On the PhD application, there is a checkbox to indicate whether you would like to be considered for the master&rsquo;s programs. In which case if the applicant wishes to be seriously considered they should complete the case analysis and submit that as a part of their application by uploading it to one of the application pages marked &ldquo;additional information.&rdquo;    What is the most important element of the application?    There is no specific part of the application that carries the most weight. Good grades and high GRE scores are both important in the admissions process. Any research or employment in the psychology field also improves an application.\u00a0 We consider all parts of your application.    What are the average GRE scores of accepted students?    The average GRE scores of accepted students vary with each application cycle. We do not publish average GRE scores but the scores that we consider competitive. For the I/O Psychology program, we consider the following competitive:    Quantitative: 154    Verbal: 158    Writing: 4.5    If English is not your first language, we do not place as much emphasis on verbal scores if TOEFL is quite good. If your score is below the minimum, you are still welcome to apply to the program, but please be aware that your application will be less competitive. Accepted students often earn scores significantly higher than the minimums.    My test scores are less than 5 years old, but they're based on the old scoring system out of 800. What scores does the I/O program consider competitive?    Verbal: 580 or above    Quantitative: 630 or above    Writing: 4.5 or above    How do I submit my GRE or GMAT scores?    You submit your official scores through ETS. The NYU code for GRE submission is 2596.\u00a0 The School Code for the GMATs is: 5TF-5G-76    More information is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Science here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.app.faq.test    What if I don&rsquo;t receive my official scores in time for the application deadline?    Plan to take the GRE&rsquo;s well in advance of the application deadline.\u00a0 You may list your unofficial scores in the application.\u00a0 Although we may admit you to the program based on unofficial score reports, your admission may be revoked if official score reports do not match.\u00a0 If your scores are not received (either unofficially or officially) by the end of our admissions process (4-6 weeks), your application may be withdrawn from consideration.    How can I compensate for low GRE or GMAT scores?    If your GRE scores are very low, it is best to retake the test. Otherwise, high grades, good recommendation letters, and experience in the field or in business may compensate to some extent for low scores. Please note that if English is not your first language, the verbal GRE score may be less critical if TOEFL is good.    Do I have to take the advanced PSYCHOLOGY GRE to apply?    No, we do not require that applicants take the GRE in psychology.    What are the application deadlines for each semester?    For Industrial/Organizational Psychology:    Spring Semester: October 1    Fall OR Summer Semester: January 15    What happens if I submit application materials late?    Materials that are submitted late will be accepted but stamped &ldquo;late&rdquo; and to the discretion of the admissions committee considered.\u00a0 If required materials are not received by the end of the admissions process (4-6 weeks after the application deadline), the application may be withdrawn.    Do early applications receive priority?    No. Applications received on or before the deadline are reviewed equally regardless of when they were submitted. The review process for I/O begins the day after the deadline when the pool is complete.    When will I get an answer from the program regarding my application?    The I/O program will generally send out decisions by April 15th for summer and fall applicants, and by November 15th for spring applicants though some applicants may be placed on a wit list and thus wait longer for decisions.    How are admissions decisions distributed?    Admissions decisions are distributed by Graduate Enrollment Services by email.\u00a0 Please ensure that emails from gsas.admissions@nyu.edu are not filtered into your spam folder.    How many students apply each year? What percentage of applicants is accepted?    Each year hundreds of students ask to be considered for the I/O program. The department takes in approximately 20 to 30 applicants from this pool each year.    What is the average age of students in the program?    The average age of students is difficult to gauge. We have students who are anywhere from 22 to over 50 years old. There are experienced professionals as well as relatively new college graduates with internship or HR experience perhaps.                     International Students     I am an international student but I have an undergraduate degree from an institution in the United States or an institution abroad that conducted all classes entirely in English. Do I need to submit TOEFL scores?    Under these circumstances, the TOEFL is not required. Apart from this exception, the TOEFL is required for all international applicants or applicants for whom English is not their native language.    As an international student, who do I contact about inquiries regarding visa applications and other paperwork?    The Office of Global Services (OGS) is the best resource for questions specific to studying at NYU as an international student.: http://www.nyu.edu/life/student-life/international-students-and-scholars.html     Will I need a 4 year degree in order to apply to the I/O program?    As per Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) and the I/O Psychology Department&rsquo;s policy you will need a 4 year study in higher education and cannot apply with 3 years or less under GSAS rules. Applicants from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Bangladesh must show completion of both the baccalaureate and master's examinations prior to registration in the Graduate School. The examinations for the Bachelor of Engineering and the Bachelor of Technology meet the application requirements. For students holding 3 year degrees from Australia, GSAS also requires a 4 year degree to apply. Applicants must have BA-honors in order to apply for degree through GSAS at NYU. If you have further concerns regarding the 4 year degree requirement, please contact Graduate Enrollment Services gsas.admissions@nyu.edu 212-998-8050    As an international student, do I need to submit my application earlier than the official deadline?    No, international students are not required to submit applications before domestic students. However, bear in mind that obtaining a student visa is often a long process, so international students should plan accordingly.                     Finances and Housing     How much is the programs tuition?    Please consult this link for detailed tuition fees. The master&rsquo;s program requires a total of 36 credit points for an average of 9 points per semester of study. Keep in mind that tuition fluctuates yearly. http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.financialaid.tuitionfees    What kind of financial aid is offered?    The department itself does not offer any financial aid. However, there are a few ways to ease the financial burden. We do offer paid teaching appointments to some master&rsquo;s students. There are also research positions. Please note that these opportunities are very competitive, and not normally given to first-year master&rsquo;s students. Usually the compensation from teaching can pay for about 1 course. If you have external funding through grants or foundations already, the graduate school does have matching grant system. For more information please visit http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/financialaid.financingeducation    What housing options does the university offer?    Graduate housing is limited and not guaranteed.\u00a0 Many students find apartments in the area. Please consult the offices of on-campus and off-campus housing for more information.    http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living.html    http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/off-campus-living.html                        Learn More     What is the best resource to learn more about the program and talk to faculty members?    The department offers several open houses throughout the year. These sessions are a great opportunity to explore the program further and interact with faculty and staff. Open houses are offered every couple of months.

Lisa Saari, Ph.D.             Formerly IBM, Boeing       &ldquo;As a result of successfully completing this program, you will be able to apply the best research, theory and practice to people issues in today&rsquo;s organizations.&rdquo;                    I/O Masters Program Requirements     Formal requirements for the MA degree in Industrial/Organizational     Psychology include the satisfactory completion of 36 points (i.e.,     credits).\u00a0 At least 24 of those credits must be taken in the Graduate     School of Arts &amp; Science at NYU, and at least 21 must be in the Psychology Department.\u00a0 One consequence of these restrictions is that no more than 12 credits can be transferred in from another university.     In addition, (1) all core courses must be taken at NYU in the Psychology   Department, and (2) students must earn a grade of at least B in all   core courses.     All of the courses in the M.A. program are 3 points each, so 12 courses   must be taken. Students may take anywhere between one and three courses   each semester. The program is expected to take two years to complete   in most cases, but can be completed a little sooner for full-time students   (especially if some courses are taken during the summer session), or   somewhat later for those working full-time. A student who has completed   all course work, but must stay enrolled to take the comprehensive examination   or complete a thesis, must pay a matriculation fee each semester until   graduation. A maximum of five years from the date of first registration   is allowed for completing the degree.      Basic course requirements (all of the following are required   for all students, and must be completed within the first two semesters   of the M.A. program) :      Introductory Course: G89.2032 Intro to I/O Psychology . Only   if a student has taken a very similar, graduate-level course at another   institution can this requirement be waived.      Statistics: G89.2016 Master's Statistics. In   special cases, G89.1016 (Introductory) or a doctoral course may be   substituted.      Research  : G89.2067 Applied Research Methods. In special cases,   another research course may be substituted.      Core Course requirements (two courses must be taken from each   core):               CORE &quot;I&quot;      CORE &quot;O&quot;                G89.2070 Personnel Selection      G89.2072 Work Motivation and Attitudes                G89.2071 Performance Measurement &amp; Rewards      G89.2074 Organizational Development                G89.2073 Training in Organizations      G89.2076 Leadership and Strategic Change              The above requirements allow for five elective courses, which can   be taken from the general program (e.g., Psychology of Social Behavior;   Introduction to Psychological Testing), other divisions of NYU (e.g.,   graduate-level Economics; Stern School of Business-MBA program), or   other universities (a limit of 9 credits can be transferred from graduate   programs at other institutions). Courses taken outside of the psychology   department must have some psychological content, and be approved by   an adviser. Elective credits can also be taken in the form of non-classroom   courses, such as Fieldwork, Independent Research, and MA Thesis Seminar.   Although Fieldwork (generally, an unpaid internship in an HR department   or consulting firm) is not required, it is strongly recommended for   students who enter the program without relevant work experience.      COMPREHENSIVE EXAM / M.A. THESIS REQUIREMENT     All students must either pass the comprehensive exam, or write an acceptable M.A. thesis.      The Comprehensive Exam: This is a three-hour written test that is given three times each year: October, February, and June. The questions are integrative in nature and are randomly selected from a large study list that is available to all students at any time. Except for rare exceptions, a student must have completed all of the basic and core requirements, as outlined above, before sitting for the exam.     MA Thesis: As an alternative to the comprehensive exam, a student may seek permission to write an M.A. thesis. To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have passed all of the basic and core requirements with at least a B+ average, and have secured the sponsorship of a full-time faculty member (in consultation with the MA director). In general, an MA thesis does not require that the student perform original or independent research, but that the student make an original contribution to the research of his/her sponsor.

Learn More           What is the best resource to learn more about the program and talk to faculty members?      Who do I contact with more specific inquiries about the master&rsquo;s program?                                  Questions about the I/O Program      Does the I/O program have any connections to the MBA program?     We do not have a formalized joint degree with the business school (Stern), but students may take related electives there. Courses like &ldquo;Managing Organizations&rdquo;, or Consumer Behavior can be used as electives.\u00a0 Please note that Stern must approve all enrollments and space may be limited.      Is there a significant difference between the General M.A. and I/O M.A. programs?     Yes. The two programs differ greatly in admissions criteria, course structure, and expected outcomes. The I/O program is much smaller and more selective. The applications are similar, but an extra case study is required for I/O admission.      How important are quantitative skills? Will I have to do research and use statistics frequently in my I/O coursework?     Quantitative skills are very important. You must be competent and technically proficient in statistics for the program, especially for advanced electives.      Do students work or have internships while in the I/O program?     Many students enter the program as current members of the workforce and maintain their jobs. Other students find jobs or internships, usually part-time, while taking classes along the way. While it is strongly recommended to do so in order to gain valuable applied experience to supplement material learned in class, working or completing an internship is not mandatory.      What are the I/O classes like?     While each class is unique, most classes strive to allow you to merge science and applied work. The structure of each class is designed to best facilitate comprehension and execution of the material. Class work includes casework, discussion, lectures, external projects, and individual and group presentations.      What is the average I/O class size?     Classes range from 10 students to the low 20s, with an average of about 16.      What is the ODA?     The Organizational Development Association is the official student and alumni organization for the I/O program at NYU, and it seeks to create a bridge between the classroom and the workplace. We are a community dedicated to building essential skills for successful I/O careers through professional development and networking. The ODA offers students an opportunity to be a functional part of an organization in a learning environment. Leadership roles are available for both new and existing members through managing events and projects related to the ODA&rsquo;s mission.      What are the I/O comprehensive exams like?     To complete the program, students must either take a comprehensive exam or write a thesis. The Comprehensive Exam is the most common choice of the MA I/O program students as the culmination of their work in the program, due to the applied focus of the program. The test requires answering three case-study type questions: one from the Industrial (I) branch, one from the Organizational (O) branch, and one from the Research Methods (R) branch. One hour is allotted for each question. Answers are rated by multiple faculty members based on comprehensiveness, use of I/O theory, and realistic applicability.      How is the I/O program at NYU different than other I/O Master&rsquo;s programs?       NYU offers a balanced Master&rsquo;s program in this field, hitting both the Industrial and the Organizational aspects evenly and stressing the importance of each. NYU also offers a high-caliber, personal experience made possible by the small number of select applicants accepted in each cohort. NYU&rsquo;s schedule encourages students to develop their professional careers while pursuing their degree. Ideally, upon completion of an MA from NYU&rsquo;s program, a graduate can enter an organization in a management position.      How long does it take to complete the I/O Master&rsquo;s program?     Many students complete the program in two calendar years, but some many need more time to complete their thesis or comprehensive exams. Much depends on the working status of the student against the progression of coursework and program completion. Students have anywhere from 2 to 5 years.      Can I work while I&rsquo;m enrolled in the I/O program?     Yes. All master&rsquo;s courses are offered in the evening on weekdays (usually at 4:20 and 6:20), so many students have day jobs while they are in the program. Organizations may be able to help with support through tuition remission programs.      I just want to take a few I/O classes. Do I still need to apply?     There is no I/O non-degree status.\u00a0 To take I/O courses, you must be enrolled as a degree-seeking I/O student, meaning you must apply to the program.                              Academics and Calendar       When does each semester begin?    The fall term usually begins in early September, the spring semester begins in late January, and summer session begins in late May. For more specific dates, consult the university calendar at: http://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/academic-calendar.html    How many classes can or should I take every semester?    Students are considered full-time when taking three courses (9 credits). \u00a0However, if you&rsquo;re working at the same time, it is recommended that you take fewer courses.                     Visiting the Campus    How can I take a campus tour?    We offer two virtual tours of our campus. One tour is an interactive map of the campus: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/gsas.admissions.virtualtour . The second virtual option is a narrated video highlighting some of the most commonly visited buildings on the Washington Square Campus: http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/visit-us/virtual-tour.html .    At this time the Graduate School of Arts and Science is not hosting in-person guided tours. However, if you decide to visit campus in person, you may use the virtual tour map as a guide. Please note that you are not able to enter most NYU buildings without an NYU ID card.    Please note that the Psychology building is a high security building and you will not be able to walk around the building or see any classrooms.    Can I make a personal appointment to meet with an advisor?    Due to the high volume of applications we receive each term (hundreds), demand far outweighs our capacity to meet with students before they are accepted into our program. As an alternative, we suggest that interested students attend one of our open house sessions , where they can meet with the director of the program and ask questions.    Can I sit in on a class?    Unfortunately, no. We have a small program that is quite interactive. We do not allow any visitors in courses as it can be disruptive to the learning process. As an alternative, we suggest that interested students attend one of our open house sessions, which can provide you with more targeted information, and allow you to ask questions to the director to the program. Please visit http://psych.nyu.edu/programs/ma/openhouse.html for the schedule of upcoming open houses.                     Application and Admissions            Where can I access the application?         http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.admissions.onlineapp           Does my undergraduate major have to be psychology in order to apply to the program?    No, we accept students from all concentrations. However, we do require that applicants have completed two courses by the time they apply to the program: an introductory psychology course and a statistics course.    Can I take my prerequisites at NYU? Where else can I take them?    The prerequisite courses can be taken at any accredited university. We accept credits from online schools, but only those that are accredited. To take prerequisites at NYU, you will need to apply as a non-degree student. However, we find online courses to be an acceptable and more accessible alternative. To satisfy a prerequisite, an online course must be affiliated with a University that has a physical campus. For example, we have found the online courses from the University of Colorado at Boulder to be acceptable: http://conted.colorado.edu/programs/independent-learning/courses/self/Psychology%20and%20Neuroscience/5178/independent-learning/?department_id=31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31    What is the undergraduate GPA requirement to apply?    We consider a competitive GPA to be a 3.0 (B). If your GPA is lower than this because of courses unrelated to psychology, such as pre-med courses, this requirement might be relaxed.    Is the reputation of my university taken into consideration during the application process?    The admissions committee recognizes the academic rigor of many universities, but undergraduate institution alone does not provide enough information to accept or deny an applicant.    Is research/work experience in the psychology field required for application?    Neither research nor employment in the field of psychology is a required part of the application. However, experience in psychology absolutely makes an application more competitive for the I/O program.    Who should I ask to write my recommendation letters?    Someone who knows you well academically is best, but professional supervisors are also acceptable. If possible, at least one academic reference is preferable.    Can I request to defer my acceptance?    Although applicants may request a deferral for one semester (not two), unless there is a substantial reason to delay for a semester, it may not necessarily be granted.\u00a0 To do so, you must officially accept the offer of admission, submit your tuition deposit, and request the deferral from the graduate school by emailing gsas.admissions@nyu.edu.    If I am not accepted to the PhD program, can I use the same application for the master&rsquo;s program?    Yes. On the PhD application, there is a checkbox to indicate whether you would like to be considered for the master&rsquo;s programs. In which case if the applicant wishes to be seriously considered they should complete the case analysis and submit that as a part of their application by uploading it to one of the application pages marked &ldquo;additional information.&rdquo;    What is the most important element of the application?    There is no specific part of the application that carries the most weight. Good grades and high GRE scores are both important in the admissions process. Any research or employment in the psychology field also improves an application.\u00a0 We consider all parts of your application.    What are the average GRE scores of accepted students?    The average GRE scores of accepted students vary with each application cycle. We do not publish average GRE scores but the scores that we consider competitive. For the I/O Psychology program, we consider the following competitive:    Quantitative: 154    Verbal: 158    Writing: 4.5    If English is not your first language, we do not place as much emphasis on verbal scores if TOEFL is quite good. If your score is below the minimum, you are still welcome to apply to the program, but please be aware that your application will be less competitive. Accepted students often earn scores significantly higher than the minimums.    My test scores are less than 5 years old, but they're based on the old scoring system out of 800. What scores does the I/O program consider competitive?    Verbal: 580 or above    Quantitative: 630 or above    Writing: 4.5 or above    How do I submit my GRE or GMAT scores?    You submit your official scores through ETS. The NYU code for GRE submission is 2596.\u00a0 The School Code for the GMATs is: 5TF-5G-76    More information is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Science here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.app.faq.test    What if I don&rsquo;t receive my official scores in time for the application deadline?    Plan to take the GRE&rsquo;s well in advance of the application deadline.\u00a0 You may list your unofficial scores in the application.\u00a0 Although we may admit you to the program based on unofficial score reports, your admission may be revoked if official score reports do not match.\u00a0 If your scores are not received (either unofficially or officially) by the end of our admissions process (4-6 weeks), your application may be withdrawn from consideration.    How can I compensate for low GRE or GMAT scores?    If your GRE scores are very low, it is best to retake the test. Otherwise, high grades, good recommendation letters, and experience in the field or in business may compensate to some extent for low scores. Please note that if English is not your first language, the verbal GRE score may be less critical if TOEFL is good.    Do I have to take the advanced PSYCHOLOGY GRE to apply?    No, we do not require that applicants take the GRE in psychology.    What are the application deadlines for each semester?    For Industrial/Organizational Psychology:    Spring Semester: October 1    Fall OR Summer Semester: January 15    What happens if I submit application materials late?    Materials that are submitted late will be accepted but stamped &ldquo;late&rdquo; and to the discretion of the admissions committee considered.\u00a0 If required materials are not received by the end of the admissions process (4-6 weeks after the application deadline), the application may be withdrawn.    Do early applications receive priority?    No. Applications received on or before the deadline are reviewed equally regardless of when they were submitted. The review process for I/O begins the day after the deadline when the pool is complete.    When will I get an answer from the program regarding my application?    The I/O program will generally send out decisions by April 15th for summer and fall applicants, and by November 15th for spring applicants though some applicants may be placed on a wit list and thus wait longer for decisions.    How are admissions decisions distributed?    Admissions decisions are distributed by Graduate Enrollment Services by email.\u00a0 Please ensure that emails from gsas.admissions@nyu.edu are not filtered into your spam folder.    How many students apply each year? What percentage of applicants is accepted?    Each year hundreds of students ask to be considered for the I/O program. The department takes in approximately 20 to 30 applicants from this pool each year.    What is the average age of students in the program?    The average age of students is difficult to gauge. We have students who are anywhere from 22 to over 50 years old. There are experienced professionals as well as relatively new college graduates with internship or HR experience perhaps.                     International Students     I am an international student but I have an undergraduate degree from an institution in the United States or an institution abroad that conducted all classes entirely in English. Do I need to submit TOEFL scores?    Under these circumstances, the TOEFL is not required. Apart from this exception, the TOEFL is required for all international applicants or applicants for whom English is not their native language.    As an international student, who do I contact about inquiries regarding visa applications and other paperwork?    The Office of Global Services (OGS) is the best resource for questions specific to studying at NYU as an international student.: http://www.nyu.edu/life/student-life/international-students-and-scholars.html     Will I need a 4 year degree in order to apply to the I/O program?    As per Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) and the I/O Psychology Department&rsquo;s policy you will need a 4 year study in higher education and cannot apply with 3 years or less under GSAS rules. Applicants from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Bangladesh must show completion of both the baccalaureate and master's examinations prior to registration in the Graduate School. The examinations for the Bachelor of Engineering and the Bachelor of Technology meet the application requirements. For students holding 3 year degrees from Australia, GSAS also requires a 4 year degree to apply. Applicants must have BA-honors in order to apply for degree through GSAS at NYU. If you have further concerns regarding the 4 year degree requirement, please contact Graduate Enrollment Services gsas.admissions@nyu.edu 212-998-8050    As an international student, do I need to submit my application earlier than the official deadline?    No, international students are not required to submit applications before domestic students. However, bear in mind that obtaining a student visa is often a long process, so international students should plan accordingly.                     Finances and Housing     How much is the programs tuition?    Please consult this link for detailed tuition fees. The master&rsquo;s program requires a total of 36 credit points for an average of 9 points per semester of study. Keep in mind that tuition fluctuates yearly. http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.financialaid.tuitionfees    What kind of financial aid is offered?    The department itself does not offer any financial aid. However, there are a few ways to ease the financial burden. We do offer paid teaching appointments to some master&rsquo;s students. There are also research positions. Please note that these opportunities are very competitive, and not normally given to first-year master&rsquo;s students. Usually the compensation from teaching can pay for about 1 course. If you have external funding through grants or foundations already, the graduate school does have matching grant system.

In addition, (1) all core courses must be taken at NYU in the Psychology   Department, and (2) students must earn a grade of at least B in all   core courses.     All of the courses in the M.A. program are 3 points each, so 12 courses   must be taken. Students may take anywhere between one and three courses   each semester. The program is expected to take two years to complete   in most cases, but can be completed a little sooner for full-time students   (especially if some courses are taken during the summer session), or   somewhat later for those working full-time. A student who has completed   all course work, but must stay enrolled to take the comprehensive examination   or complete a thesis, must pay a matriculation fee each semester until   graduation. A maximum of five years from the date of first registration   is allowed for completing the degree.      Basic course requirements (all of the following are required   for all students, and must be completed within the first two semesters   of the M.A. program) :      Introductory Course: G89.2032 Intro to I/O Psychology . Only   if a student has taken a very similar, graduate-level course at another   institution can this requirement be waived.      Statistics: G89.2016 Master's Statistics. In   special cases, G89.1016 (Introductory) or a doctoral course may be   substituted.      Research  : G89.2067 Applied Research Methods. In special cases,   another research course may be substituted.      Core Course requirements (two courses must be taken from each   core):               CORE &quot;I&quot;      CORE &quot;O&quot;                G89.2070 Personnel Selection      G89.2072 Work Motivation and Attitudes                G89.2071 Performance Measurement &amp; Rewards      G89.2074 Organizational Development                G89.2073 Training in Organizations      G89.2076 Leadership and Strategic Change              The above requirements allow for five elective courses, which can   be taken from the general program (e.g., Psychology of Social Behavior;   Introduction to Psychological Testing), other divisions of NYU (e.g.,   graduate-level Economics; Stern School of Business-MBA program), or   other universities (a limit of 9 credits can be transferred from graduate   programs at other institutions). Courses taken outside of the psychology   department must have some psychological content, and be approved by   an adviser. Elective credits can also be taken in the form of non-classroom   courses, such as Fieldwork, Independent Research, and MA Thesis Seminar.   Although Fieldwork (generally, an unpaid internship in an HR department   or consulting firm) is not required, it is strongly recommended for   students who enter the program without relevant work experience.      COMPREHENSIVE EXAM / M.A. THESIS REQUIREMENT     All students must either pass the comprehensive exam, or write an acceptable M.A. thesis.      The Comprehensive Exam: This is a three-hour written test that is given three times each year: October, February, and June. The questions are integrative in nature and are randomly selected from a large study list that is available to all students at any time. Except for rare exceptions, a student must have completed all of the basic and core requirements, as outlined above, before sitting for the exam.     MA Thesis: As an alternative to the comprehensive exam, a student may seek permission to write an M.A. thesis. To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have passed all of the basic and core requirements with at least a B+ average, and have secured the sponsorship of a full-time faculty member (in consultation with the MA director). In general, an MA thesis does not require that the student perform original or independent research, but that the student make an original contribution to the research of his/her sponsor.

Who do I contact with more specific inquiries about the master&rsquo;s program?                                  Questions about the I/O Program      Does the I/O program have any connections to the MBA program?     We do not have a formalized joint degree with the business school (Stern), but students may take related electives there. Courses like &ldquo;Managing Organizations&rdquo;, or Consumer Behavior can be used as electives.\u00a0 Please note that Stern must approve all enrollments and space may be limited.      Is there a significant difference between the General M.A. and I/O M.A. programs?     Yes. The two programs differ greatly in admissions criteria, course structure, and expected outcomes. The I/O program is much smaller and more selective. The applications are similar, but an extra case study is required for I/O admission.      How important are quantitative skills? Will I have to do research and use statistics frequently in my I/O coursework?     Quantitative skills are very important. You must be competent and technically proficient in statistics for the program, especially for advanced electives.      Do students work or have internships while in the I/O program?     Many students enter the program as current members of the workforce and maintain their jobs. Other students find jobs or internships, usually part-time, while taking classes along the way. While it is strongly recommended to do so in order to gain valuable applied experience to supplement material learned in class, working or completing an internship is not mandatory.      What are the I/O classes like?     While each class is unique, most classes strive to allow you to merge science and applied work. The structure of each class is designed to best facilitate comprehension and execution of the material. Class work includes casework, discussion, lectures, external projects, and individual and group presentations.      What is the average I/O class size?     Classes range from 10 students to the low 20s, with an average of about 16.      What is the ODA?     The Organizational Development Association is the official student and alumni organization for the I/O program at NYU, and it seeks to create a bridge between the classroom and the workplace. We are a community dedicated to building essential skills for successful I/O careers through professional development and networking. The ODA offers students an opportunity to be a functional part of an organization in a learning environment. Leadership roles are available for both new and existing members through managing events and projects related to the ODA&rsquo;s mission.      What are the I/O comprehensive exams like?     To complete the program, students must either take a comprehensive exam or write a thesis. The Comprehensive Exam is the most common choice of the MA I/O program students as the culmination of their work in the program, due to the applied focus of the program. The test requires answering three case-study type questions: one from the Industrial (I) branch, one from the Organizational (O) branch, and one from the Research Methods (R) branch. One hour is allotted for each question. Answers are rated by multiple faculty members based on comprehensiveness, use of I/O theory, and realistic applicability.      How is the I/O program at NYU different than other I/O Master&rsquo;s programs?       NYU offers a balanced Master&rsquo;s program in this field, hitting both the Industrial and the Organizational aspects evenly and stressing the importance of each. NYU also offers a high-caliber, personal experience made possible by the small number of select applicants accepted in each cohort. NYU&rsquo;s schedule encourages students to develop their professional careers while pursuing their degree. Ideally, upon completion of an MA from NYU&rsquo;s program, a graduate can enter an organization in a management position.      How long does it take to complete the I/O Master&rsquo;s program?     Many students complete the program in two calendar years, but some many need more time to complete their thesis or comprehensive exams. Much depends on the working status of the student against the progression of coursework and program completion. Students have anywhere from 2 to 5 years.      Can I work while I&rsquo;m enrolled in the I/O program?     Yes. All master&rsquo;s courses are offered in the evening on weekdays (usually at 4:20 and 6:20), so many students have day jobs while they are in the program. Organizations may be able to help with support through tuition remission programs.      I just want to take a few I/O classes. Do I still need to apply?     There is no I/O non-degree status.\u00a0 To take I/O courses, you must be enrolled as a degree-seeking I/O student, meaning you must apply to the program.                              Academics and Calendar       When does each semester begin?    The fall term usually begins in early September, the spring semester begins in late January, and summer session begins in late May. For more specific dates, consult the university calendar at: http://www.nyu.edu/registrar/calendars/academic-calendar.html    How many classes can or should I take every semester?    Students are considered full-time when taking three courses (9 credits). \u00a0However, if you&rsquo;re working at the same time, it is recommended that you take fewer courses.                     Visiting the Campus    How can I take a campus tour?    We offer two virtual tours of our campus. One tour is an interactive map of the campus: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/gsas.admissions.virtualtour . The second virtual option is a narrated video highlighting some of the most commonly visited buildings on the Washington Square Campus: http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/visit-us/virtual-tour.html .    At this time the Graduate School of Arts and Science is not hosting in-person guided tours. However, if you decide to visit campus in person, you may use the virtual tour map as a guide. Please note that you are not able to enter most NYU buildings without an NYU ID card.    Please note that the Psychology building is a high security building and you will not be able to walk around the building or see any classrooms.    Can I make a personal appointment to meet with an advisor?    Due to the high volume of applications we receive each term (hundreds), demand far outweighs our capacity to meet with students before they are accepted into our program. As an alternative, we suggest that interested students attend one of our open house sessions , where they can meet with the director of the program and ask questions.    Can I sit in on a class?    Unfortunately, no. We have a small program that is quite interactive. We do not allow any visitors in courses as it can be disruptive to the learning process. As an alternative, we suggest that interested students attend one of our open house sessions, which can provide you with more targeted information, and allow you to ask questions to the director to the program. Please visit http://psych.nyu.edu/programs/ma/openhouse.html for the schedule of upcoming open houses.                     Application and Admissions            Where can I access the application?         http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.admissions.onlineapp           Does my undergraduate major have to be psychology in order to apply to the program?    No, we accept students from all concentrations. However, we do require that applicants have completed two courses by the time they apply to the program: an introductory psychology course and a statistics course.    Can I take my prerequisites at NYU? Where else can I take them?    The prerequisite courses can be taken at any accredited university. We accept credits from online schools, but only those that are accredited. To take prerequisites at NYU, you will need to apply as a non-degree student. However, we find online courses to be an acceptable and more accessible alternative. To satisfy a prerequisite, an online course must be affiliated with a University that has a physical campus. For example, we have found the online courses from the University of Colorado at Boulder to be acceptable: http://conted.colorado.edu/programs/independent-learning/courses/self/Psychology%20and%20Neuroscience/5178/independent-learning/?department_id=31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31    What is the undergraduate GPA requirement to apply?    We consider a competitive GPA to be a 3.0 (B). If your GPA is lower than this because of courses unrelated to psychology, such as pre-med courses, this requirement might be relaxed.    Is the reputation of my university taken into consideration during the application process?    The admissions committee recognizes the academic rigor of many universities, but undergraduate institution alone does not provide enough information to accept or deny an applicant.    Is research/work experience in the psychology field required for application?    Neither research nor employment in the field of psychology is a required part of the application. However, experience in psychology absolutely makes an application more competitive for the I/O program.    Who should I ask to write my recommendation letters?    Someone who knows you well academically is best, but professional supervisors are also acceptable. If possible, at least one academic reference is preferable.    Can I request to defer my acceptance?    Although applicants may request a deferral for one semester (not two), unless there is a substantial reason to delay for a semester, it may not necessarily be granted.\u00a0 To do so, you must officially accept the offer of admission, submit your tuition deposit, and request the deferral from the graduate school by emailing gsas.admissions@nyu.edu.    If I am not accepted to the PhD program, can I use the same application for the master&rsquo;s program?    Yes. On the PhD application, there is a checkbox to indicate whether you would like to be considered for the master&rsquo;s programs. In which case if the applicant wishes to be seriously considered they should complete the case analysis and submit that as a part of their application by uploading it to one of the application pages marked &ldquo;additional information.&rdquo;    What is the most important element of the application?    There is no specific part of the application that carries the most weight. Good grades and high GRE scores are both important in the admissions process. Any research or employment in the psychology field also improves an application.\u00a0 We consider all parts of your application.    What are the average GRE scores of accepted students?    The average GRE scores of accepted students vary with each application cycle. We do not publish average GRE scores but the scores that we consider competitive. For the I/O Psychology program, we consider the following competitive:    Quantitative: 154    Verbal: 158    Writing: 4.5    If English is not your first language, we do not place as much emphasis on verbal scores if TOEFL is quite good. If your score is below the minimum, you are still welcome to apply to the program, but please be aware that your application will be less competitive. Accepted students often earn scores significantly higher than the minimums.    My test scores are less than 5 years old, but they're based on the old scoring system out of 800. What scores does the I/O program consider competitive?    Verbal: 580 or above    Quantitative: 630 or above    Writing: 4.5 or above    How do I submit my GRE or GMAT scores?    You submit your official scores through ETS. The NYU code for GRE submission is 2596.\u00a0 The School Code for the GMATs is: 5TF-5G-76    More information is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Science here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.app.faq.test    What if I don&rsquo;t receive my official scores in time for the application deadline?    Plan to take the GRE&rsquo;s well in advance of the application deadline.\u00a0 You may list your unofficial scores in the application.\u00a0 Although we may admit you to the program based on unofficial score reports, your admission may be revoked if official score reports do not match.\u00a0 If your scores are not received (either unofficially or officially) by the end of our admissions process (4-6 weeks), your application may be withdrawn from consideration.    How can I compensate for low GRE or GMAT scores?    If your GRE scores are very low, it is best to retake the test. Otherwise, high grades, good recommendation letters, and experience in the field or in business may compensate to some extent for low scores. Please note that if English is not your first language, the verbal GRE score may be less critical if TOEFL is good.    Do I have to take the advanced PSYCHOLOGY GRE to apply?    No, we do not require that applicants take the GRE in psychology.    What are the application deadlines for each semester?    For Industrial/Organizational Psychology:    Spring Semester: October 1    Fall OR Summer Semester: January 15    What happens if I submit application materials late?    Materials that are submitted late will be accepted but stamped &ldquo;late&rdquo; and to the discretion of the admissions committee considered.\u00a0 If required materials are not received by the end of the admissions process (4-6 weeks after the application deadline), the application may be withdrawn.    Do early applications receive priority?    No. Applications received on or before the deadline are reviewed equally regardless of when they were submitted. The review process for I/O begins the day after the deadline when the pool is complete.    When will I get an answer from the program regarding my application?    The I/O program will generally send out decisions by April 15th for summer and fall applicants, and by November 15th for spring applicants though some applicants may be placed on a wit list and thus wait longer for decisions.    How are admissions decisions distributed?    Admissions decisions are distributed by Graduate Enrollment Services by email.\u00a0 Please ensure that emails from gsas.admissions@nyu.edu are not filtered into your spam folder.    How many students apply each year? What percentage of applicants is accepted?    Each year hundreds of students ask to be considered for the I/O program. The department takes in approximately 20 to 30 applicants from this pool each year.    What is the average age of students in the program?    The average age of students is difficult to gauge. We have students who are anywhere from 22 to over 50 years old. There are experienced professionals as well as relatively new college graduates with internship or HR experience perhaps.                     International Students     I am an international student but I have an undergraduate degree from an institution in the United States or an institution abroad that conducted all classes entirely in English. Do I need to submit TOEFL scores?    Under these circumstances, the TOEFL is not required. Apart from this exception, the TOEFL is required for all international applicants or applicants for whom English is not their native language.    As an international student, who do I contact about inquiries regarding visa applications and other paperwork?    The Office of Global Services (OGS) is the best resource for questions specific to studying at NYU as an international student.: http://www.nyu.edu/life/student-life/international-students-and-scholars.html     Will I need a 4 year degree in order to apply to the I/O program?    As per Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) and the I/O Psychology Department&rsquo;s policy you will need a 4 year study in higher education and cannot apply with 3 years or less under GSAS rules. Applicants from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Bangladesh must show completion of both the baccalaureate and master's examinations prior to registration in the Graduate School. The examinations for the Bachelor of Engineering and the Bachelor of Technology meet the application requirements. For students holding 3 year degrees from Australia, GSAS also requires a 4 year degree to apply. Applicants must have BA-honors in order to apply for degree through GSAS at NYU. If you have further concerns regarding the 4 year degree requirement, please contact Graduate Enrollment Services gsas.admissions@nyu.edu 212-998-8050    As an international student, do I need to submit my application earlier than the official deadline?    No, international students are not required to submit applications before domestic students. However, bear in mind that obtaining a student visa is often a long process, so international students should plan accordingly.                     Finances and Housing     How much is the programs tuition?    Please consult this link for detailed tuition fees. The master&rsquo;s program requires a total of 36 credit points for an average of 9 points per semester of study. Keep in mind that tuition fluctuates yearly. http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.financialaid.tuitionfees    What kind of financial aid is offered?    The department itself does not offer any financial aid. However, there are a few ways to ease the financial burden. We do offer paid teaching appointments to some master&rsquo;s students. There are also research positions. Please note that these opportunities are very competitive, and not normally given to first-year master&rsquo;s students. Usually the compensation from teaching can pay for about 1 course. If you have external funding through grants or foundations already, the graduate school does have matching grant system. For more information please visit http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/financialaid.financingeducation    What housing options does the university offer?    Graduate housing is limited and not guaranteed.\u00a0 Many students find apartments in the area. Please consult the offices of on-campus and off-campus housing for more information.    http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living.html    http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/off-campus-living.html                        Learn More     What is the best resource to learn more about the program and talk to faculty members?    The department offers several open houses throughout the year. These sessions are a great opportunity to explore the program further and interact with faculty and staff. Open houses are offered every couple of months.

In addition, (1) all core courses must be taken at NYU in the Psychology   Department, and (2) students must earn a grade of at least B in all   core courses.     All of the courses in the M.A. program are 3 points each, so 12 courses   must be taken. Students may take anywhere between one and three courses   each semester. The program is expected to take two years to complete   in most cases, but can be completed a little sooner for full-time students   (especially if some courses are taken during the summer session), or   somewhat later for those working full-time. A student who has completed   all course work, but must stay enrolled to take the comprehensive examination   or complete a thesis, must pay a matriculation fee each semester until   graduation. A maximum of five years from the date of first registration   is allowed for completing the degree.      Basic course requirements (all of the following are required   for all students, and must be completed within the first two semesters   of the M.A. program) :      Introductory Course: G89.2032 Intro to I/O Psychology . Only   if a student has taken a very similar, graduate-level course at another   institution can this requirement be waived.      Statistics: G89.2016 Master's Statistics. In   special cases, G89.1016 (Introductory) or a doctoral course may be   substituted.      Research  : G89.2067 Applied Research Methods. In special cases,   another research course may be substituted.      Core Course requirements (two courses must be taken from each   core):               CORE &quot;I&quot;      CORE &quot;O&quot;                G89.2070 Personnel Selection      G89.2072 Work Motivation and Attitudes                G89.2071 Performance Measurement &amp; Rewards      G89.2074 Organizational Development                G89.2073 Training in Organizations      G89.2076 Leadership and Strategic Change              The above requirements allow for five elective courses, which can   be taken from the general program (e.g., Psychology of Social Behavior;   Introduction to Psychological Testing), other divisions of NYU (e.g.,   graduate-level Economics; Stern School of Business-MBA program), or   other universities (a limit of 9 credits can be transferred from graduate   programs at other institutions). Courses taken outside of the psychology   department must have some psychological content, and be approved by   an adviser. Elective credits can also be taken in the form of non-classroom   courses, such as Fieldwork, Independent Research, and MA Thesis Seminar.   Although Fieldwork (generally, an unpaid internship in an HR department   or consulting firm) is not required, it is strongly recommended for   students who enter the program without relevant work experience.      COMPREHENSIVE EXAM / M.A. THESIS REQUIREMENT     All students must either pass the comprehensive exam, or write an acceptable M.A. thesis.      The Comprehensive Exam: This is a three-hour written test that is given three times each year: October, February, and June. The questions are integrative in nature and are randomly selected from a large study list that is available to all students at any time. Except for rare exceptions, a student must have completed all of the basic and core requirements, as outlined above, before sitting for the exam.     MA Thesis: As an alternative to the comprehensive exam, a student may seek permission to write an M.A. thesis. To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have passed all of the basic and core requirements with at least a B+ average, and have secured the sponsorship of a full-time faculty member (in consultation with the MA director). In general, an MA thesis does not require that the student perform original or independent research, but that the student make an original contribution to the research of his/her sponsor.
