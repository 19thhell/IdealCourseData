Overview       Software continues to pervade our lives and is now routinely  deployed in safety and security critical systems.

How can one ensure that software works  reliably? Program Verification is the area of computer  science that studies mathematical methods to answer this  question. In the last decade, Program Verification has brought  forth sophisticated tools that assist software engineers in  building reliable software. In this course, we will explore  these tools. We will learn how they are used to enable  rigorous software development, and we will study the  algorithms that work under their hoods.

Topics        Modeling Software    Design by Contract    Runtime Assertion Checking    Automated Test Case Generation    Formal Verification    Semantics of Programming Languages    Static Analysis         Tools        The list of tools that we will discuss in the course includes:         Alloy    JML    JMLUnit    Korat    Dafny         Prerequisites       This course will be open to MS and PhD students. Participants  should have basic understanding of mathematical concepts such  as sets and relations and the ability to write mathematical  proofs. Also, basic programming experience in Java is  assumed. Preliminary knowledge in Logics and Verification is  useful but not mandatory. The course is self-contained and any  required background knowledge is taught in class.

You may also use this list to ask   questions and discuss issues related to the course. If you   have enrolled before the start of the term, you are   automatically subscribed to the list. Otherwise, use the above   link to subscribe manually.       Grading     Homework (30%), term project (30%), final exam (40%).     Academic Integrity        Please review   the    departmental academic integrity policy . In this course,   you may discuss homework problems and assignments with other   students, but the work you turn in must be your own. Do not   copy another student's work. Also, you should consult the   instructor before using materials or code other than that   provided in class. Copying code or other work without giving   appropriate acknowledgment is a serious offense with   consequences ranging from no credit to potential expulsion.
