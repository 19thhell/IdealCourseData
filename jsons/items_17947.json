Future research could include understanding the forces that drive lottery-ticket purchases, what prompts risk-taking behaviors by cab drivers, or identifying the intersections at which pedestrians are most likely to jaywalk\u2014and why.    IISDM will draw upon resources at existing NYU schools and centers\u2014the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), the Stern School of Business, and Langone Medical Center\u2014as well as NYU\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Science and its global academic centers and campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.    \u201cWith access to the massive data streams flowing through the City of New York, IISDM has the opportunity to test models and policies developed by scholars at a previously unimaginable scale,\u201d adds Glimcher. \u201cMoreover, NYU\u2019s unique assets offer an unparalleled opportunity to unite scholars studying decision-making in a synergy that would be possible nowhere else.\u201d      In 2013, NYU launched an Initiative in Data Science and Statistics, which aims to harness today\u2019s torrent of data in order to make advances in medicine, science, technology, business, and a range of other fields. The university-wide effort has included the creation of the Center for Data Science and a masters-degree program in this emerging academic discipline.

Future research could include understanding the forces that drive lottery-ticket purchases, what prompts risk-taking behaviors by cab drivers, or identifying the intersections at which pedestrians are most likely to jaywalk\u2014and why.    IISDM will draw upon resources at existing NYU schools and centers\u2014the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), the Stern School of Business, and Langone Medical Center\u2014as well as NYU\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Science and its global academic centers and campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.    \u201cWith access to the massive data streams flowing through the City of New York, IISDM has the opportunity to test models and policies developed by scholars at a previously unimaginable scale,\u201d adds Glimcher. \u201cMoreover, NYU\u2019s unique assets offer an unparalleled opportunity to unite scholars studying decision-making in a synergy that would be possible nowhere else.\u201d      In 2013, NYU launched an Initiative in Data Science and Statistics, which aims to harness today\u2019s torrent of data in order to make advances in medicine, science, technology, business, and a range of other fields. The university-wide effort has included the creation of the Center for Data Science and a masters-degree program in this emerging academic discipline.
