The majority of entering freshmen are in the top 10% of their class.                  Diversity (Undergraduate)      Our undergraduate student body continues to be increasingly diverse. At NYU, the student body has no ethnic majority. In 2002, international students made up 4% of the total, and in 2012, that grew to 12% . The 2013 freshman class is 18% international from a record-breaking 87 countries .      All 50 states are represented in the undergraduate student body.      In 2012, African American and Latino/a students made up 19% of the freshman class, up from 11% in 2002.      In 2013, 17% of the freshman class are first-generation college students.                                                              Financial Aid (Institutional Aid)      Institutional aid for undergraduates has increased by almost 138% between 2002 and 2012 (from $78,138,160 to $185,828,888), while aid for all students (undergraduate, graduate and PhD students) increased by 134% between 2002 and 2012.                      In 2002, the average aid award for new freshmen was $8,960, which covered 34% of tuition . In 2012, the average aid award for new freshmen was $23,721 and covered 55% of tuition . The difference comes from increases in financial aid and investing financial aid in a way that awards aid to students who need it most.                  Financial Aid (Pell Grants)      Pell grants, in dollar terms, increased by 142% between 2002 and 2011 (from $8,648,286 to $20,896,467 ). Pell is an important metric of economic diversity. The freshman Pell Grant population at Yale is 13%, at Johns Hopkins, 12%, at Princeton, 11%, and at Tufts, 10%. The Pell Grant population among all students at NYU is 22%.                      Percentage of NYU Students Who Receive Pell Grants Compared to Other Institutions                               According to the Institute of International Education\u2019s annual Open Doors Survey, NYU sends more students abroad than any other university, ranking number one for the last ten years. (The IIE survey counts all study-abroad experiences, including those that are shorter than a full semester.)               Study Abroad (Undergraduate)      The number of undergraduates studying abroad for a semester or more has almost doubled from 2002 to 2013.                      In 2002 we had 5 Global Academic Centers. Today we have 13 NYU locations away from New York, including our degree-granting campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.                  Class Size      65% of classes have less than 20 students . This percentage has been stable for 10 years even with an increasing student body. The number of sections with 50 or more students has declined from 10 to 9 percent .                  Areas of Study      Over 40 areas of study have been added at the Undergraduate level.

As such, it is annually budgeted for capital maintenance and other projects authorized by the Board.        Cash &amp; Unrestricted Investments      The University\u2019s cash and unrestricted investments increased from $699 million in fiscal 2002 to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013.

The majority of entering freshmen are in the top 10% of their class.                  Diversity (Undergraduate)      Our undergraduate student body continues to be increasingly diverse. At NYU, the student body has no ethnic majority. In 2002, international students made up 4% of the total, and in 2012, that grew to 12% . The 2013 freshman class is 18% international from a record-breaking 87 countries .      All 50 states are represented in the undergraduate student body.      In 2012, African American and Latino/a students made up 19% of the freshman class, up from 11% in 2002.      In 2013, 17% of the freshman class are first-generation college students.                                                              Financial Aid (Institutional Aid)      Institutional aid for undergraduates has increased by almost 138% between 2002 and 2012 (from $78,138,160 to $185,828,888), while aid for all students (undergraduate, graduate and PhD students) increased by 134% between 2002 and 2012.                      In 2002, the average aid award for new freshmen was $8,960, which covered 34% of tuition . In 2012, the average aid award for new freshmen was $23,721 and covered 55% of tuition . The difference comes from increases in financial aid and investing financial aid in a way that awards aid to students who need it most.                  Financial Aid (Pell Grants)      Pell grants, in dollar terms, increased by 142% between 2002 and 2011 (from $8,648,286 to $20,896,467 ). Pell is an important metric of economic diversity. The freshman Pell Grant population at Yale is 13%, at Johns Hopkins, 12%, at Princeton, 11%, and at Tufts, 10%. The Pell Grant population among all students at NYU is 22%.                      Percentage of NYU Students Who Receive Pell Grants Compared to Other Institutions                               According to the Institute of International Education\u2019s annual Open Doors Survey, NYU sends more students abroad than any other university, ranking number one for the last ten years. (The IIE survey counts all study-abroad experiences, including those that are shorter than a full semester.)               Study Abroad (Undergraduate)      The number of undergraduates studying abroad for a semester or more has almost doubled from 2002 to 2013.                      In 2002 we had 5 Global Academic Centers. Today we have 13 NYU locations away from New York, including our degree-granting campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.                  Class Size      65% of classes have less than 20 students . This percentage has been stable for 10 years even with an increasing student body. The number of sections with 50 or more students has declined from 10 to 9 percent .                  Areas of Study      Over 40 areas of study have been added at the Undergraduate level.

In the past, a U.S. Marshall submitted    his personal journal including narratives of the verbal and nonverbal behavior    of felons, as well as a lecture/dem on verbal judo; a poet/yoga teacher    submitted a webfolio uniting her original poems with drawings of various    yoga postures; an au pair woman studying psychology did a nonverbal/verbal    case study of her manic depressive charge and devised an innovative system    of play therapy to help him; an actress documented her use of sound, movement    and nonverbal communication in the creation of specific characters; a businessman    studied the nonverbal communication of the Chinese in international business    deals during his trip to China. Search this web site for ideas as well as    the links to student projects in all disciplines.                   (A multi-disciplinary course for creative writing and social/health science majors. Dr. Keefer is a published writer of fiction, a screenwriting  consultant, a licensed massage therapist, a certified personal trainer and aerobics  instructor, and a practicing kinesiologist.     Language and the Body is divided into two activities: the Keefer BRAINBODY   GYMNASIUM and nonverbal/verbal communication techniques and character analysis   in plays, screenplays, legal trials and psychophysical therapeutic exchanges.       The first half of the semester consists of physical and mental exercises using   all senses and modalities (Keefer brainbody gymnasium) to integrate language   and the body, followed by lectures, in-class writing and acting, and discussion   on nonverbal communication in the various disciplines. The midterm exam is a   21/2 hour in-class writing exam in the computer lab on communication/character   and how it relates to your individual project.     The second half of the semester consists of class presentations where you use   language and the body to illustrate the communication/character problems in the   discipline of your choice as well as the development of webfolios to be completed   the last day of class.   Early in the semester each student has a private conference with the professor   to determine the needs, boundaries, and characteristics of her/his project.   Thereafter, you will tailor in-class and weekly assignments, the midterm exam and   especially the class presentation and webfolio to fulfill the criteria of your particular   project.   THE KEEFER BRAINBODY GYMNASIUM consists of mental and physical exercises   to develop strength, flexibility, endurance, posture (focus, balance etc.) and   coordination (organization, dynamics, versatility, agility, speed etc.) You   should come to class in gym clothes prepared to move, but you will also be writing   and thinking passionately and furiously as all these categories apply to mental   exercises as well. You need not be a superathlete or an aerobics diva to move.   You are exploring your mindbody, not competing on ESPN. Although we will be   acting out, improvising and creating dramatic, therapeutic and legal scenes,   you need not have acting talent. In fact, shyness and embarrassment are fine.   Darwin spent pages discussing \"blushing\" in his book The Expression of Emotions   in Man and Animals!    Language and the Body is great for:    Creative writers who want to ground  their work in a deeper knowledge of language and the body, character and  communication;   Health care professionals who want to define and explore the  therapeutic relationship;   Social Science majors who want to study the nonverbal/verbal communication  in legal trials and write and perform opening and closing statements,  or work on a problem in cross-cultural communication;   Philosophers and Fitness professionals who want to explore the subtle relationships between   mind and body.     Reading Material    There will be weekly reading assignments from the required texts,  handouts of dramatic scenes and case studies, and material from the internet.   You are expected to add at least 5 more reading items of your choice to help you  with your webfolio and class presentation, including a biography for your characte  analysis. The biography can help you create a character in fiction or serve as  a model for investigation in criminology, disease, politics etc.  You pick whatever sources you want for your projects: for example, you can study a particular disease and add medical books and journals;  or compare two trials and add historical and legal books;  or study the body in cyberspace and submit hypertext;  or read books on screenwriting to help you with a dramatic project.    Under Professor Keefer at NYU Bookstore   The Anatomy Coloring Book   BodyMind by Ken Dychtwald  Perfume by Patrick Suskind ( a contemporary  thriller about monsters and the body in eighteenth century France)  The Natural History of the Senses by Diane Ackerman  Nonverbal Communication   The Psychology of Language and Communication (a psycho-sociological textbook synthesizing current theories on verbal and nonverbal communication)  Descartes' Error ( a scientific/philosophical book including the latest research on the brain) by Antonio R. Damasio   In this course we will explore the body itself, drawing on the sciences of anatomy,  kinesiology and physiology; the state of the body when creating language, (using exercises such as relaxation, breath control, ideokinesis, sense memory,  hypnosis, awareness of pain, posture);  the way the body reacts with the environment while  writing (silence, music, noise, pen, pencil, computer, tape recorder);  the ways the body communicates emotions and information without  language (in both dramatic and therapeutic scenes); words in the language that  refer to the body and bodily functions;  the effect of disease, injury, and health on characterisation; and the rhythms  of literature based on the biological experiences of birth, death, orgasms,   eating and eliminating.            Every 3 hour class will include:         Braingymnasium exercises to develop strength, flexibility, endurance, posture,   coordination and relaxation/stress reduction      Improvisation of fictional and therapeutic scenes using   Keefer's body parts technique      In-class writing about the body, and with body awareness      Readings of students' scenes, essays, monologues, poems and stories      Scientific presentations about the body from the social and   health science majors      Discussion of readings and how they relate to projects      Surfing the net and organization of newsgroups and webfolios.        COURSE REQUIREMENTS   The most important requirements are attendance and participation in the weekly assignments and readings which are graded Excellent, Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory. You cannot get an A if you miss more than one class; if you miss more than 3, you cannot even get a B. You must complete 4 main projects, (which can be related to the same area of interest), for which you will receive letter grades:     The MYfolio: Students prepare a MYfolio to be submitted the last day of class. The MYfolio is for you so it can be as messy, self-indulgent and cathartic as long as you include weekly assignments and in-class writing.  The WEBfolio: This is an html version of your best creative and research writing, graphics, photos, designs or even shockwave to be broadcast eternally in cyberspace for a global audience. The rough draft comes after the midterm; the final project the second to last day of class.  The Midterm Exam: There will be a midterm exam on nonverbal communication based on core lecture material  dealing with the analysis of body posture, gesture, image, facial expression,  musculoskeletal and tissue tonus and adhesions, vocal  resonance, timbre and pitch, effort-shape movement, posturing/ performing/ pretending profiles, vulnerability and the  individual and cultural relationship to time and space.   The Class Presentation: You take over the class for at least 90 minutes with the project of your choice, which should be a combination of physical, mental and multisensory stimuli.

The majority of entering freshmen are in the top 10% of their class.                  Diversity (Undergraduate)      Our undergraduate student body continues to be increasingly diverse. At NYU, the student body has no ethnic majority. In 2002, international students made up 4% of the total, and in 2012, that grew to 12% . The 2013 freshman class is 18% international from a record-breaking 87 countries .      All 50 states are represented in the undergraduate student body.      In 2012, African American and Latino/a students made up 19% of the freshman class, up from 11% in 2002.      In 2013, 17% of the freshman class are first-generation college students.                                                              Financial Aid (Institutional Aid)      Institutional aid for undergraduates has increased by almost 138% between 2002 and 2012 (from $78,138,160 to $185,828,888), while aid for all students (undergraduate, graduate and PhD students) increased by 134% between 2002 and 2012.                      In 2002, the average aid award for new freshmen was $8,960, which covered 34% of tuition . In 2012, the average aid award for new freshmen was $23,721 and covered 55% of tuition . The difference comes from increases in financial aid and investing financial aid in a way that awards aid to students who need it most.                  Financial Aid (Pell Grants)      Pell grants, in dollar terms, increased by 142% between 2002 and 2011 (from $8,648,286 to $20,896,467 ). Pell is an important metric of economic diversity. The freshman Pell Grant population at Yale is 13%, at Johns Hopkins, 12%, at Princeton, 11%, and at Tufts, 10%. The Pell Grant population among all students at NYU is 22%.                      Percentage of NYU Students Who Receive Pell Grants Compared to Other Institutions                               According to the Institute of International Education\u2019s annual Open Doors Survey, NYU sends more students abroad than any other university, ranking number one for the last ten years. (The IIE survey counts all study-abroad experiences, including those that are shorter than a full semester.)               Study Abroad (Undergraduate)      The number of undergraduates studying abroad for a semester or more has almost doubled from 2002 to 2013.                      In 2002 we had 5 Global Academic Centers. Today we have 13 NYU locations away from New York, including our degree-granting campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.                  Class Size      65% of classes have less than 20 students . This percentage has been stable for 10 years even with an increasing student body. The number of sections with 50 or more students has declined from 10 to 9 percent .                  Areas of Study      Over 40 areas of study have been added at the Undergraduate level.

The vast majority were either renovations of existing space or newly acquired space that replaced leased space. University capital investments over the past 10 years have been funded from a combination of university borrowing, philanthropy and working capital funds generated from operations .           Academic Investments      There was $905 million invested in academic capital improvements across nine schools between 2002 and 2011. Over 50% of the general purpose classrooms have been renovated, replaced, or added since 2006.

Student Investments       Between 2002 and 2011, there was $628 million invested in student housing and student services. Part of that investment was a move from leased to owned space, which will result in a cumulative cash flow surplus of $275 million over 30 years.

Endowment      The endowment for all parts of the University including NYU Langone Medical Center was $3.121 billion at the end of fiscal 2013 \u2013 an increase of 175% .           The data below include NYU's Washington Square campus and all NYU sites within the global network, but not the assets and operating results of NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.        Net Assets      Net assets more than doubled over this period, to $3.6 billion .        Excess of Operating Revenues over Operating Expenses      The University's Excess of Operating Revenues over Operating Expenses increased from $10 million to $63 million between 2002 and 2013, according to the University's audited financial statements. As part of the the University's capital budgeting process, the University Board directs that the Excess of Operating Revenues over Operating Expenses be used as working capital in support of the University's capital requirements. As such, it is annually budgeted for capital maintenance and other projects authorized by the Board.        Cash &amp; Unrestricted Investments      The University\u2019s cash and unrestricted investments increased from $699 million in fiscal 2002 to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013.        Financial Aid      Total disbursements of financial aid increased by 151% , compared with a 105% increase in total revenue from tuition and fees. As a percentage of tuition and fees, financial aid increased from 17% in fiscal 2002 to 22% in fiscal 2013.        Grants and Contracts      There was a 324% increase in grants and contracts.

Keefer--Fall1996, Spring 1997, Fall 1997              N.B. For those seeking to obtain life experience credit for this course,    the requirements are simple: Students submit a CREATIVE portfolio or webfolio    showing the unique ways they have brought language and the body together.    They can approach it from any discipline. In the past, a U.S. Marshall submitted    his personal journal including narratives of the verbal and nonverbal behavior    of felons, as well as a lecture/dem on verbal judo; a poet/yoga teacher    submitted a webfolio uniting her original poems with drawings of various    yoga postures; an au pair woman studying psychology did a nonverbal/verbal    case study of her manic depressive charge and devised an innovative system    of play therapy to help him; an actress documented her use of sound, movement    and nonverbal communication in the creation of specific characters; a businessman    studied the nonverbal communication of the Chinese in international business    deals during his trip to China. Search this web site for ideas as well as    the links to student projects in all disciplines.                   (A multi-disciplinary course for creative writing and social/health science majors. Dr. Keefer is a published writer of fiction, a screenwriting  consultant, a licensed massage therapist, a certified personal trainer and aerobics  instructor, and a practicing kinesiologist.     Language and the Body is divided into two activities: the Keefer BRAINBODY   GYMNASIUM and nonverbal/verbal communication techniques and character analysis   in plays, screenplays, legal trials and psychophysical therapeutic exchanges.       The first half of the semester consists of physical and mental exercises using   all senses and modalities (Keefer brainbody gymnasium) to integrate language   and the body, followed by lectures, in-class writing and acting, and discussion   on nonverbal communication in the various disciplines. The midterm exam is a   21/2 hour in-class writing exam in the computer lab on communication/character   and how it relates to your individual project.     The second half of the semester consists of class presentations where you use   language and the body to illustrate the communication/character problems in the   discipline of your choice as well as the development of webfolios to be completed   the last day of class.   Early in the semester each student has a private conference with the professor   to determine the needs, boundaries, and characteristics of her/his project.   Thereafter, you will tailor in-class and weekly assignments, the midterm exam and   especially the class presentation and webfolio to fulfill the criteria of your particular   project.   THE KEEFER BRAINBODY GYMNASIUM consists of mental and physical exercises   to develop strength, flexibility, endurance, posture (focus, balance etc.) and   coordination (organization, dynamics, versatility, agility, speed etc.) You   should come to class in gym clothes prepared to move, but you will also be writing   and thinking passionately and furiously as all these categories apply to mental   exercises as well. You need not be a superathlete or an aerobics diva to move.   You are exploring your mindbody, not competing on ESPN. Although we will be   acting out, improvising and creating dramatic, therapeutic and legal scenes,   you need not have acting talent. In fact, shyness and embarrassment are fine.   Darwin spent pages discussing \"blushing\" in his book The Expression of Emotions   in Man and Animals!    Language and the Body is great for:    Creative writers who want to ground  their work in a deeper knowledge of language and the body, character and  communication;   Health care professionals who want to define and explore the  therapeutic relationship;   Social Science majors who want to study the nonverbal/verbal communication  in legal trials and write and perform opening and closing statements,  or work on a problem in cross-cultural communication;   Philosophers and Fitness professionals who want to explore the subtle relationships between   mind and body.     Reading Material    There will be weekly reading assignments from the required texts,  handouts of dramatic scenes and case studies, and material from the internet.   You are expected to add at least 5 more reading items of your choice to help you  with your webfolio and class presentation, including a biography for your characte  analysis. The biography can help you create a character in fiction or serve as  a model for investigation in criminology, disease, politics etc.  You pick whatever sources you want for your projects: for example, you can study a particular disease and add medical books and journals;  or compare two trials and add historical and legal books;  or study the body in cyberspace and submit hypertext;  or read books on screenwriting to help you with a dramatic project.    Under Professor Keefer at NYU Bookstore   The Anatomy Coloring Book   BodyMind by Ken Dychtwald  Perfume by Patrick Suskind ( a contemporary  thriller about monsters and the body in eighteenth century France)  The Natural History of the Senses by Diane Ackerman  Nonverbal Communication   The Psychology of Language and Communication (a psycho-sociological textbook synthesizing current theories on verbal and nonverbal communication)  Descartes' Error ( a scientific/philosophical book including the latest research on the brain) by Antonio R. Damasio   In this course we will explore the body itself, drawing on the sciences of anatomy,  kinesiology and physiology; the state of the body when creating language, (using exercises such as relaxation, breath control, ideokinesis, sense memory,  hypnosis, awareness of pain, posture);  the way the body reacts with the environment while  writing (silence, music, noise, pen, pencil, computer, tape recorder);  the ways the body communicates emotions and information without  language (in both dramatic and therapeutic scenes); words in the language that  refer to the body and bodily functions;  the effect of disease, injury, and health on characterisation; and the rhythms  of literature based on the biological experiences of birth, death, orgasms,   eating and eliminating.            Every 3 hour class will include:         Braingymnasium exercises to develop strength, flexibility, endurance, posture,   coordination and relaxation/stress reduction      Improvisation of fictional and therapeutic scenes using   Keefer's body parts technique      In-class writing about the body, and with body awareness      Readings of students' scenes, essays, monologues, poems and stories      Scientific presentations about the body from the social and   health science majors      Discussion of readings and how they relate to projects      Surfing the net and organization of newsgroups and webfolios.        COURSE REQUIREMENTS   The most important requirements are attendance and participation in the weekly assignments and readings which are graded Excellent, Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory. You cannot get an A if you miss more than one class; if you miss more than 3, you cannot even get a B. You must complete 4 main projects, (which can be related to the same area of interest), for which you will receive letter grades:     The MYfolio: Students prepare a MYfolio to be submitted the last day of class. The MYfolio is for you so it can be as messy, self-indulgent and cathartic as long as you include weekly assignments and in-class writing.  The WEBfolio: This is an html version of your best creative and research writing, graphics, photos, designs or even shockwave to be broadcast eternally in cyberspace for a global audience. The rough draft comes after the midterm; the final project the second to last day of class.  The Midterm Exam: There will be a midterm exam on nonverbal communication based on core lecture material  dealing with the analysis of body posture, gesture, image, facial expression,  musculoskeletal and tissue tonus and adhesions, vocal  resonance, timbre and pitch, effort-shape movement, posturing/ performing/ pretending profiles, vulnerability and the  individual and cultural relationship to time and space.   The Class Presentation: You take over the class for at least 90 minutes with the project of your choice, which should be a combination of physical, mental and multisensory stimuli.
