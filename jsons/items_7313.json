The semester-long series is also free and open to the public. Students will receive priority. For additional information, contact Martha Diaz, director of the Hip Hop Education Center at Martha.diaz@nyu.edu.   \u201cThe Hip-Hop Education Center continues to keep us connected to the current work in the field, but this time through technology,\u201d said Pedro Noguera, Metro Center director. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to collaborating with our partners to engage our students and the public at large in this Hip-Hop conversation to illustrate how this phenomenon continues to impact education, culture, and society.\u201d    Curated by Willie Ney, director of UW-Madison\u2019s Office of Multicultural Arts Initiative (OMAI) and HHEC Director Martha Diaz, the series will be hosted by Noguera and Ernest Morrell, director of the Institute for Urban and Minority Education (IUME). Guest speakers will include MC Lyte on the campus of UW-Madison, Chris Walker, Marcella Runell Hall, Jen Johnson, Christopher Emdin, and Carlos \u201cMare139\u201d Rodriguez. Class topics include: Promising Practices for Utilizing a Social Justice Hip-Hop Pedagogy: Notes from the Real World; Art for the Next Century: How Graffiti Transformed Contemporary Art and Remixed History; From the Source to the Course: Issues and Strategies for Collaborative Hip-Hop Scholarship; Rhyme, Rhythm &amp; Resistance: Afro-Cosmopolitanism, Art and Public Pedagogy in South Africa\u2019s Social Justice Struggles.   \u201cUW-Madison is proud to be in partnership with the Hip-Hop Education Center and its partners for \u201cGetting Real,\u201d said UW-Madison Vice Provost Damon A. Williams. \u201cOur role as the only university campus with a spoken-word and Hip-Hop arts residential learning community is magnified and supported through these innovative approaches to teaching an emerging discipline in cutting-edge art. This cooperative venture will bring learning into a virtual forum and result in the creation of a transcendent national instruction network.\u201d    Since launching in 2010, the HHEC has cultivated Hip-Hop scholars, teaching artists, cultural workers, activists, and social entrepreneurs to utilize the Hip-Hop power to educate and transform communities. A key strategy for the HHEC is to partner with institutions of higher learning and community building organizations in order to professionalize the field of Hip-Hop education and contribute best practices to the education reform movement at-large. One of the main goals of the HHEC, OMAI and IUME collaboration is to develop a teaching certificate for teaching artists, in-service teachers, and students of education using Hip-Hop in the classroom and extended-day programs.                         About The Office of Multicultural Arts Initiative (OMAI)  The Office of Multicultural Arts Initiatives (OMAI) provides culturally relevant and transformative arts programming to promote positive social dialogue and to give cultural art forms a legitimate academic forum. By harnessing the broad cultural influence of spoken word, hip hop and emerging, as well as traditional art forms, OMAI initiatives create learning environments that improve retention and graduation success and prepares future leaders to reinvest in their communities. By continually refreshing this paradigm that integrates traditional academics and cutting edge arts activism, OMAI empowers transnational leaders with new tools for inclusive community building. Founded in 2005, OMAI is a unit of the Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity and Climate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. http://omai.wisc.edu.
