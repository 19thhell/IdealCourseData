For this reason it feels quite risky but it can produce surprises and respond to possibilities unrestricted by fixed narrative.       (Collective Statement of IOU Theatre)      Absurd, naturalistic, funny, touching, and lyrical are words that best describ e The High Line group devised site specific project, which was created during the Educational Theatre Devised Theatre class in the Summer of 2014.\u00a0 I was challenged by the process of devising a piece of theatre that was fashioned by numerous writers, the explorations through movement, and the observations of the space. Throughout the start of the process I would ask myself questions such as: \u00a0How would a group of ten people create a work from scratch in three weeks? What would our piece be about? How could a performance travel through The High Line ? The answers to those questions would come along through a creative process that had me wondering at every turn.   Upon the first day of class, I was unsure of what our group project would entail. I originally thought that we would pair with other classmates and create a piece that would be performed in the classroom setting. When I realized that it was the entire class creating a piece of site specific theatre, my thoughts were filled with questions and worries. How are all of these people going to be able to agree on anything?   I was nervous and excited when the suggestion of performing on The High Line was proposed.\u00a0 I had never been apart of a site specific theatre piece. I did not know what to expect from the process or how the piece would be created.\u00a0 It was not until the assigned readings of theory and technique did I understand the methodology for Devised Theatre, which is all about experimentation with ideas, images, and concepts. The process is creatively chaotic but will lead to editing, revision, and re-shaping.   The writings that the group created brought about some unique challenges and insight about The High Line. The writings varied in style. For example, there were several works about children and parents interacting in the space, there was a young woman stalking a past lover, and a daughter relaying her dissatisfaction of traveling with her mother by the use of hash tags. Because of the different tones and subjects within the group writings, the question of cohesiveness came into play within the process. What would our work be about? Should we incorporate some fictional historical narratives or should we remain in the present day experiences of The High Line ? Should we fuse the two and meld the past and the present to create one cohesive unit?   Another challenge in the process creating the piece was The High Line itself. We needed to effectively perform on a 1.45 mile elevated railway park that is surrounded by construction noise fitting our written pieces and new historical narratives fit into the space. We asked: What do we want our audience to gain from the work we created? How would we perform around so many patrons to The High Line \u2013 a multitude of tourists, business people and casual onlookers?   The role of director became important to the eventual flow of the piece. Dr. Smithner created a proposed outline of the pieces and suggested rewrites that created a more cohesive project. The inclusion of a few members of the group to brainstorm and edit the structure continued, but the only way to really understand where the different scenes and monologues would work was to physically return to The High Line . Returning to The High Line allowed the group to make adjustments and trouble shoot instances when certain locations would not be available due to noise or patrons lounging within the performance space.   The day of performance was an exciting time because we had no real concrete idea about how the performance would be received. The actual performance on The High Line was subject to several challenges &#8212; construction noise, unexpected patrons being in performances spaces, and an interruption by the park police all created sense of adventure among the group. \u00a0I think that the use of music, movement, and text gave our audience members a varied and playful experience. We came together as an ensemble and worked together to problem solve and create a piece of devised theatre that was unique to that day and the collaborative. What I learned most through the group collaboration was that you must expect the unexpected and move forward. There will be times where the work will not make much sense, but if you stay true to your purpose and goal it will end in an adventure that you did not expect.

Her 28 second graders at Stuart Country Day School in Princeton, NJ, have been working on crafting clear enunciation, appropriate projection, and unique character voices. In October, her students produced two Halloween Radio Shows, capturing sound effects and working on creating a spooky environment. In late fall, Audible recording talent Virginia Bosch spoke with the girls about professional recording. As their culminating project, each class worked with a partner to record books by Eric Carle and Dr. Seuss, constructing unique voices to distinguish between characters. These fourteen titles were given to the kindergarten class to serve as a part of the media library for years to come. Christina is proud of her students and thrilled to share with them all she gained while at NYU!

I feel gratitude for the experience, gratitude for the depth of learning, and gratitude for being able to work with a talented design team and ensemble. This experience was new for me because it was my first time serving as a director for a new play in development.    Table read at first rehearsal.     This past summer I was able to take Problems in Play Production with professor and playwright, Joe Salvatore. During that class, I was able to track the role of a director in the new play development process. That learning got to come full circle once I was able to put it to practice, by working alongside Joe as a director for one of his plays.    Window Cast (L to R): Kirstin Kammermeyer, Megan Ibarra, and Kyla Blocker   I immediately connected with \u201cHow do You Say \u2018Window\u2019 in Italian?\u201d, catching the\u00a0 Three Sisters Chekhov reference in the title. The play appealed to me because of the strong sibling dynamic and the way that the sisters resembled Olga, Masha, and Irina. It was impossible not to connect to this play on a personal level because of my husband\u2019s work as a nurse, specifically caring for those that suffer from dementia.          Window cast with director, Elena Stephenson (second from left)       What I loved most about all these plays is though they were very different, they all held a common thread of exploring human connection and capturing a moment &#8220;in real time.&#8221;    Photo \u00a9 Chianan Yen                          Posted by jpj201 on March 25, 2015 11:48 am   | Permalink |   Comments                                  Directing M Squared              By Nick Robertson   When Joe Salvatore posted the Student Directing notice for In Real Time , I jumped at the opportunity.\u00a0 I\u2019d taken three directing classes in the department (with Nan Smithner and Amy Cordileone, all of which I highly recommend) and was eager to put the concrete skills I\u2019d learned into real-world practice.\u00a0 I applied to direct M Squared , a mysterious little play about a semi-schlub of a guy, Chad, whose sedate life is totally disrupted when Marilyn Monroe crashes into his kitchen one night.\u00a0 As I began my application, I realized skills alone were not going to be enough to successfully direct this show.\u00a0 The play spoke to me in a very personal way and I would need to acknowledge that, lean into it, and be able to share it with other people in order to do the story justice.\u00a0 Deep down, what I connected to was this person who\u2019d built a safe and static life, denying himself of some very deep-seated desires (passion! excitement! beauty! glamor!) until his subconscious literally had to wake him up to the possibility of a more integrated and joyous existence.\u00a0 Talk about a classic equation for comedy!\u00a0 What followed were three and a half months of continually jumping into the void of vulnerability, sharing a private part of myself through this play, first with Joe, then my cast, then the designers, then finally with the audience.\u00a0 I found that at each step of the journey, people not only accepted what I shared with them, but supported and appropriated it so that by opening night, all of us were telling the same story from our own very personal points of view.\u00a0 It was a really magical collaborative experience throughout, and one I hope to replicate in all my other theatrical work.

The second of our esteemed new students is Michael Yurchak.    A teacher once told me that to experience the sensation of being thrilled is to embrace the space where fear and excitement meet. I am thrilled! Thrilled to be embarking on a new journey at NYU and to be returning to the department of Educational Theater after 11 years in the field. I am also truly honored to be invited back to be part of this community. I live in Los Angeles and will be commuting virtually as well as joining study groups and intensive semesters whenever possible. As a teacher, I am particularly influenced by the work I do as an associate instructor of Fitzmaurice Voicework, focused on the release of breath and body tension in order to discover and express with authentic voice. I try to incorporate the principles of this practice into my work as a teaching artist, in an effort to help facilitate the empowerment of students as they seek to make themselves heard. I also perform regularly as a voice artist and actor and (most importantly) I&#8217;m a dad to two amazing little creatures (Luca 9 and Sascha 6) who want desperately to see New York City! I hope to focus my doctoral work on the design and implementation of meaningful teaching artist programs within the context of urban nonprofit arts organizations. As equal parts artist, educator, and administrator, I work full time across many facets of the field, and I hope to learn more about ways to add leadership and value to the various organizations I represent. Since I started my career after getting my masters in 2004, I have consistently found connection with and inspiration from fellow NYU alums as mentors, colleagues, and friends all over the country. There is no other program I know of with as far reaching impact, and it is with the most sincere gratitude that I join you!

The first of our esteemed new students is Carmen Meyers.      Carmen Meyers: Thrilled and Honored   I am thrilled to be one of the first two students in the newly revised Educational Theatre Ed.D program for the Fall 2015 semester. \u00a0As I embark on this unfamiliar path of doctoral work, I am excited, honored, and to be honest a little nervous.\u00a0 As with most things, I\u2019ve learned that this combination is the perfect environment for me to begin my work.\u00a0 I feel proud and a great sense of responsibility to continue to create and explore new strategies for teaching and learning through theatre practice.\u00a0 As I am a full time instructor in the Communication Arts and Sciences Department at Bronx Community College, my hopes are that my doctoral work will continue to help me serve my students. I am currently working with the Psychological Services Department to address domestic abuse and mental health issues on campus.\u00a0 It is in this area that I would like to focus my doctoral work by delving deeper in to the barriers of mental health services within Latino/Hispanic cultures. \u00a0I plan to create forum pieces to help aid these conversations and bring awareness and understanding to this issue.\u00a0 I am eager to gain the knowledge and expertise that this program offers and that I will need to go forward.\u00a0 This program has been a pioneer in the exploration and potency of applied theatre practice and education around the world, and through its outstanding faculty I hope to add to the work that has already been done.
