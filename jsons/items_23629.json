Search:             Editorial Statement    The goals of JOE, The Journal for Online Education, are to encourage   and document creativity in online education,    optimal mindbody conditioning in cyberspace   culture, and cultural diversity in global communication   in a range of discourse from abstract, esoteric articles in academic styles,   cutting edge experimental research, news articles, business reports, creative   writing and art work to the stories and drawings of children. The journal   is not organized by discipline but seeks to develop new paradigms of thought   by developing multi-, inter-, cross-, and trans-disciplinary and anti-disciplinary   activities in basic adventure and problem areas related to cyberspace. The   WWW Journal of Online Education is inclusive but experimental, and therefore   seeks the most original, provocative submissions possible. The mission of   the WWW Journal of Online Education is to turn us all into intellectual activists,   to provide access and quality education to all people around the world, to   develop and condition our physiology and kinesiology so that our meat doesn't   rot in cyberspace, and to preserve freedom of expression, inquiry, creativity   and cultural integrity as technology continues to develop. Although JOE is   based in New York, its audience is global. In his keynote address, \"Online   Education as a New Professional Discipline\" at the TCC98 online conference   (organized by Jim Shimabukuro), Professor Steve McCarty writes: \"The future   will thus be a co-creation of Westerners and non-Westerners.\"     GUIDELINES for the WWW Journal of Online Education    Subject Matter: We accept anything related   to teaching or researching online or in cyber-enhanced classes anywhere in   the world; or how traditional knowledge and/or conventional cognitive processing   are enhanced, destroyed and transformed by the medium of cyberspace.

THE BRAIN GYM (cross-disciplinary articles   to solve the problem of how to make our brains work better)                   This section includes academic APA articles on hard-core cognitive     science addressing the issues of how the brain processes, remembers,     creates and forgets information in cyberspace, as well as hypothetical     and experimental articles on the metaphorical comparison to exercise     physiology and application of different cognitive domains to the wild     west of cyberspace. Creativity needs rules and structures but when and     how do we break these rules to enhance our thinking, charting new territory     in those cerebral fissures, increasing our synaptic connections? What     are the connections between mental and physical conditioning? We encourage     the submission of nonlinear experiments, games, poetry, artwork and     stories to encourage synchronicity between right and left brain functions.The     brain gym paradigm continues with creative ways to make learning fun     for children.           &quot;Hi-Tech   Online Anthem to Creativity&quot; by Mihkel Pilv    Motivation in Filmmaking by Zach Golden     Cognitive Development and Cognitive Domain: Connecting the Paths to Success by Rachel Hanley       II: How does the Internet Change the Way We   Think?

If information is simple, clear, accessible, and &quot;dumbed down,&quot;   it will be easy to distribute all over the world, to even the most impoverished,   illiterate group of people. In some ways this is good. It gives everyone in   the global community a baseline of knowledge, a common language. But now we   are not only compromising creativity, but also global diversity.

New York University. May 1995. Author: Mona de Vestel &ndash; Assistant Professor of Writing &amp; New Media. SUNY Institute of Technology.   In a time when flesh is lethal, what does it mean for us to turn on our computers to touch one another? What does it mean for us to spend our time in a state of disembodiment? Whether it is online or in the dimension of virtual reality, we become bodiless.    Mundus Imaginalis: Time in Cyberspace by   Mona de Vestel , 2009   Temporality, the thread of time, is in fact the container for the demarcation of real or   imagined events in our lives. Historically, philosophers have crystallized the definitions of time   within parameters of succession. Western philosophy indulges in the inflated importance given to   the notion of the past and the grandiose role it plays in referencing our modes of temporal   existence.          &ldquo; Virtual&rdquo; Honesty: The Chains of Technology by Courtney Graham, December 2007           Photo:   Albert Lung     How do we present ourselves to others in cyberspace? Do we lose   our \"souls\" in virtual communities or discover parts of our unconscious we   were not aware of? Does this WWW global magazine virtualize the archetypes   of the Jungian collective unconscious? When does the internet become a destructive   addiction? Is privacy still important in the global age and if so, how do   we preserve it? Is there such a thing as cyber-fright, like stage-fright or   writers block, or does the nature of the medium encourage us to let it \"all   hang out\"? How does the Western concept of self conflict with the non-Western   sense of state and community, or even &quot;soul&quot;? Creativity demands   a respect for the self, a Western concept in terms of material goals, but   an Eastern one when developing spiritual goals. The self is messy, complicated,   chaotic and contradictory, as all of you who have studied Jung and Freud,   or even remembered your own dreams, know. Where is the place in our online   educational model for the &quot;deepspace&quot; of the unconscious? What studies   are being done on how the internet affects pathologies such as attention deficit   disorder, autism and manic depression?

Hultin, President of the Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly), told students in the Pfizer Auditorium at the second Sloan Cyber Security Lecture. In his opening remarks, Hultin stressed a simple point: a career in cyber security equals job security. Hultin also called for more women to consider it, citing the day&rsquo;s Distinguished Lecturer, Debora Plunkett, Director of the Information Assurance Directorate for the National Security Agency, as an example. &ldquo;She has a career we can all try to emulate,&rdquo; Hultin said.     In her lecture, Plunkett echoed the sentiment: &ldquo;I need fresh legs, and I see a lot of them here in the room.&rdquo; Plunkett, whose role involves defending national security systems, addressed emerging cyber security threats and mitigation strategy: with more technology used every day, &ldquo;the more we need to protect it.&rdquo; She focused on defining emerging threats, why we should study them, and &ldquo;what opportunities exist for you as you leave this institution and go out into the work world.&rdquo;     Her concluding remarks emphasized the broad spectrum of new and growing threats, and that effective response strategies must target both the attacker and defender motivations. Academia and business must work together to respond effectively, crossing lines between &ldquo;government, industry, and infrastructure.&rdquo;     A panel discussion featuring Hamilton William J. Wansley, Senior VP at Booz Allen, and Bill Phelps, a Managing Director in Accenture&rsquo;s security practice, followed the lecture. During the panel, moderated by Professor Nasir Memon, Phelps echoed Plunkett&rsquo;s call to protecting cyberspace: we need to &ldquo;build a fence to keep people out,&rdquo; moving beyond defense. &ldquo;For all the students, you&rsquo;re in a great place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is zero unemployment in cyber security.&rdquo;     In the hallway outside the Pfizer auditorium, students displayed posters highlighting their research in cyber security and dealing with threats and attacks. &ldquo;Survivable Key Compromise in Software Update Systems,&rdquo; by a group of students including NYU-Poly Vladimir Diaz and Konstantin Andrianov demonstrated the danger of compromise in software updates via a chart with principles for &ldquo;Designing for Survivability.&rdquo;     Jeyavijayan (JV) Rajendran, a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering who is researching Integrated Circuit Security, said &ldquo;The Sloan lecture was great,&rdquo; Rajendran added. It gave him &ldquo;excellent feedback about our research&rdquo; and &ldquo;an experience about how to convey our research ideas effectively to others who might not be aware of that problem.&rdquo;     &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a huge demand for cyber security right now, across the board,&rdquo; said James Sillcox, Director of NYU-Poly&rsquo;s Wasserman Center for Career Development. &ldquo;The problems evolve and the solutions evolve with them.

Search:             Editorial Statement    The goals of JOE, The Journal for Online Education, are to encourage   and document creativity in online education,    optimal mindbody conditioning in cyberspace   culture, and cultural diversity in global communication   in a range of discourse from abstract, esoteric articles in academic styles,   cutting edge experimental research, news articles, business reports, creative   writing and art work to the stories and drawings of children. The journal   is not organized by discipline but seeks to develop new paradigms of thought   by developing multi-, inter-, cross-, and trans-disciplinary and anti-disciplinary   activities in basic adventure and problem areas related to cyberspace. The   WWW Journal of Online Education is inclusive but experimental, and therefore   seeks the most original, provocative submissions possible. The mission of   the WWW Journal of Online Education is to turn us all into intellectual activists,   to provide access and quality education to all people around the world, to   develop and condition our physiology and kinesiology so that our meat doesn't   rot in cyberspace, and to preserve freedom of expression, inquiry, creativity   and cultural integrity as technology continues to develop. Although JOE is   based in New York, its audience is global. In his keynote address, \"Online   Education as a New Professional Discipline\" at the TCC98 online conference   (organized by Jim Shimabukuro), Professor Steve McCarty writes: \"The future   will thus be a co-creation of Westerners and non-Westerners.\"     GUIDELINES for the WWW Journal of Online Education    Subject Matter: We accept anything related   to teaching or researching online or in cyber-enhanced classes anywhere in   the world; or how traditional knowledge and/or conventional cognitive processing   are enhanced, destroyed and transformed by the medium of cyberspace.

Creativity needs rules and structures but when and     how do we break these rules to enhance our thinking, charting new territory     in those cerebral fissures, increasing our synaptic connections? What     are the connections between mental and physical conditioning?

In a time when flesh is lethal, what does it mean for us to turn on our computers to touch one another? What does it mean for us to spend our time in a state of disembodiment? Whether it is online or in the dimension of virtual reality, we become bodiless.    Mundus Imaginalis: Time in Cyberspace by   Mona de Vestel , 2009   Temporality, the thread of time, is in fact the container for the demarcation of real or   imagined events in our lives. Historically, philosophers have crystallized the definitions of time   within parameters of succession. Western philosophy indulges in the inflated importance given to   the notion of the past and the grandiose role it plays in referencing our modes of temporal   existence.          &ldquo; Virtual&rdquo; Honesty: The Chains of Technology by Courtney Graham, December 2007           Photo:   Albert Lung     How do we present ourselves to others in cyberspace?

A response by Toni Sant        \"Cyberspace exists, insofar as it can be said to exist, by virtue of human agency.\"    (William Gibson, Mona Lisa Overdrive : 107)       The 'mind' is not a separate entity from the 'body'. Mind-without-body and body-without-mind is not what we mean when we say 'mind' or 'body'. The 'body-mind' is where the 'mind' and the 'body' fulfill their ontology. Similarly, what is commonly accepted as 'reality' is not be taken to be the diametrical opposite of 'virtuality'. Virtual reality is not an oxymoron.    This paper introduces an articulation of my personal exploration of the performative aspects of cyberspace. By declaring my convictions on the body-mind and the reality of the virtual, I am presenting an a priori setting for my investigation. It is within this value-system that I operate as a professionally-trained broadcaster, a 'licensed' theatre-maker, and a graduate student of performance studies. With this paper I am attempting to find a space within which my training and my academic interests can be recombined towards a reality that makes my research and my practice come so close to each other that they function as one, like my body-mind.    The body-mind is the organic body, yet there exists a virtual body; a body without organs. The relationship between these two bodies is one of the best resources for performance material (Critical Art Ensemble: 69). Anthropologist David Tomas proposes \"parallels that can be drawn between the postindustrial, cyberspatial transubstantiation of the human body and related social and symbolic transformations of the human body in traditional rites de passage rituals.\" (36) I shall use his theory to examine the transubstantiation of my own body-mind to what is known and recognized as cyberspace.    The concept of encounter is particularly important for anyone studying performance. It is central to any performance, even when the exchange is not between organic bodies in the same space at the same time. Like the Critical Art Ensemble I believe that \"[performance] has become the site of mediation, not so much between social relationships proper, but between the concrete and the virtual worlds, the sedentary and the nomadic, the organic and the electronic, and the present and the absent\" (68-69). This immediately presents us with a vital link which can help us blur out all the dualistic elements and Cartesian arguments that instantly attempt to invade the scenario.    A fundamental (\" in principio erat Verbum et Verbum erat apud Deum et Deus erat Verbum \") discourse on performativity was proposed by linguistic theorist J.L. Austin in 1955. He indicates two types of verbal utterance: the \"constative\" and the \"performative\". The constative refers to descriptive language; this category is not of immediate interest to us.) Austin defines the performative as \"derived, of course, from 'perform', the usual verb which is the noun 'action': it indicates that the issuing of the utterance is the performing of an action - it is not normally thought of as just saying something\"(6-7). Thus we speak of \"a performative utterance\" as the single most powerful unit of Austian performativity. The performative utterance is so very powerful because, as Austin suggests, it creates the organic/everyday world.    During a preliminary exercise dealing with the same question posed in the title to this paper, I constructed a practical experiment based on my encounter with the presence of a particular body in cyberspace known as Leonardo da Vinci. My Leonardo web-pages were an experiment into the possibilities of a hypertext as a recombinant cyber-performance. The red and green buttons on the gateway to the website and the performative \"I shall not return...\" and \"I promise to explore all the links\" were my attempt to create obvious Austinian concepts which could articulate themselves in cyberspace.    I have a strong resistance to thinking about the term performative as being only what Austin says it is. My opposition is mainly derived from the way I have been academically instructed to devalue the spoken word in performance contexts; especially if written in the form of dramatic literature. With the Internet, words have acquired a value which was negated to them by non-literary studies of theatre and other forms of theatrical performance. Thus, taking Austin's theory as a springboard for a re-evaluation of performativity, I propose that the essential elements of the performative act are:      encounter-interaction-exchange     not as separate circumstances but as inseparable qualities of performativity. The performative act is a convergence of these actions as one. Encounter: a coming together of at least two bodies. Interaction: action which is somehow always in re-action. Exchange: constant change is imperative, ex- stasis, ecstacy, in search of a virtual reality.    In its discussion on The Recombinant Theater and the Performative Matrix , the Critical Art Ensemble has made me realize that organic space corresponds to Austin's \"constative\", and that cyberspace is necessarily \"performative\" by its very nature (57-79). This becomes even more evident when the terrain of \"cyberspace\" is mapped out in a precise manner with the intention of finding the various possibilities to understanding some of its performative aspects.    The term \"cyberspace\" is attributed to William Gibson who in his novel Neuromancer  (1984) speculated about the role of computers and hackers in the future:   Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical conceptsA graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding(51)   We should not be mislead to think of cyberspace as a specific physical place. It seems that the meaning, if not the structure, of cyberspace has somewhat evolved since Gibson first outlined it. The on-line hacker Jargon File, version 3.1.0, 15 OCT 1994 has an entry for the term which looks something like this:  Cyberspace /si:'ber-spays/ n.   1. Notional 'information-space' loaded with visual cues and navigable with brain-computer interfaces called 'cyberspace decks'; a characteristic prop of cyberpunk. At the time of this writing (mid-1991), serious efforts to construct virtual reality interfaces modeled explicitly on Gibsonian cyberspace are already under way, using more conventional devices such as glove sensors and binocular TV headsets.   Over time the term has come to signify a specific nonspace, unaffected by the cyberpunk. Consider the claims made by two of the scholars whose research work informs mine.   David Tomas: \"cyberspace is a postindustrial work environment predicted on a new hardwired communications interface that provides a direct and total sensorial access to a parallel world of potential work spaces\"(35).    Phil Morle: \"'Cyberspace' is not just another word for 'virtual reality' but is a particular manifestation of it. It is created the moment the human being encounters itself, or others, virtually with mediating technology such as computers, TVs, videos, and telephones - where interaction with the world is through a technological interface\"(1996b).   As far as I'm concerned, all communication between two or more parties done through a computer interface is performed in cyberspace. Thus, when I insert a floppy disk or a CD-ROM into my computer and read whatever is on it, I am interfacing with the creator(s) of whatever is on that disk; even though the information transmitted through diskettes and CDs has preset parameters. When the contents call for interactivity, we enter the sphere of the performative in cyberspace.    Since the Internet is steadily assimilating all mediating technology, cyberspace now implies communicaton over the Internet more than through any other medium. Performative elements related to cyberspace outside the cyberspatial sphere of the Internet are beyond my current interests. Their exclusion is of no immediate consequence to my research, and I am aware of the fact that cyberspace, even as I have just explained it, precedes the Internet.    Before we go any further, I must stress that it is essential that we do not think of the Internet as a specific physical place. In her introduction to the special issue of Women &amp; Performance on Sexuality and Cyberspace (Fall 1996), Theresa Senft explains the nature of the Internet very eloquently:   Properly speaking, the Internet is not a thing at all, but rather the effect of millions of performances called \"packet switching.\" In packet switching, messages are sent out via modem from one computer to a \"switching node\" where they are then divided into workable units. The units are, in turn, transmitted to their destination and reassembled. Packet switching protocol requires a series of computer and telephone calculations, occurring in many different locations around the world, simultaneously. The effect of packet switching, what we call \"The Internet,\" then, is really a series of cooperative performance gestures from multiple computer and telephone systems. The Net functions in a way that the telephone alone (because it operates on a dedicated circuit) does not. Although there is a thing called \"the telephone,\" there is not, properly speaking, a place called the Internet. Rather, the Net's status as a place is a metaphorical hallucination, although an understandably useful one.   The Internet is a preeminent virtual space, and its nature is constantly being re-created by every person who taps into it to impart or search for information. It is fundamentally pluralistic and embraces differing and often conflicting positions. Surprisingly, Baudrillard maintains that \" le virtuel n'est peut-&ecirc;tre pas une forme universelle de vie mais une singularit&eacute; .\" 1  This view works out in the context of the Internet only if we recognize that it is \"a singularity\" in constant flux. And, although five years have passed since Michael Benedikt declared that \"cyberspace itself is an elusive and future thing, and one can hardly be definitive at this early stage\"(22), we are still far from being \"definitive\" about it.    My first encounter with an academic idea of performance and cyberspace happened during the winter of 1994/95 when I discovered Phil Morle's Communitek: Performance at the Electronic Frontier at the website for the Center of Theatre Practice. 2  I was intrigued by this work and the rest of the material at the site, particularly because I felt that Kaos Theatre , of which Phil Morle is the artistic director, and Platonium, the performance group I work with in a similar capacity, shared a set of common values. In spite of this, a series of email messages to and from Morle developed into what I believe to be a misunderstanding of each other's intentions. At the time I did not possess the basic technical/academic knowledge to clarify my thoughts to him through cyberspace. I failed to recognize a basic principle which Morle himself presents so clearly in Communitek : \"The first mistakeis to consider this new medium in the same way, and with the same rules as the one we are currently working in\" (1995a).    It is also possible that the miscommunication arose from the \"abstracted representations of self and the body, separate from the individual, [which] are simultaneously present in numerous locations, interacting and recombining with others, beyond the control of the individual\" (Critical Art Ensemble: 58). But, if they are \"beyond the control of the individual,\" where is the matrix of control? Is it determined by chance in the same way that two live performances of the same 'theatrical production' are never exactly the same? Phil Morle's words resonate with deeper meaning now.   I am starting to use the term 'Communitek' rather than 'theatre' so that we do not get confused. I am not talking about grafting existing artforms onto new media I am talking about new environments for interactions - new artforms - new entertainments - new media. The structures we will eventually create for Cyberspace over the next ten years are yet to be designed (1995a).   Regardless of Morle's call for new terminology and \"new environments for interaction, we often think of cyberspace in terms of ritual, one of the primary loci for performance studies. One expressive articulation of this nature is presented by William J. Mitchell in his 1995 book City of Bits: Space, Place and the Infobahn .   Each morning I turn to some nearby machine to log into electronic mail. I click on an icon to open an \"inbox\" filled with messages from round the worldI type replies immediately, then drop them into an \"outbox,\" from which they are forwarded automatically to the appropriate destinations. [] If I have time before I finish gulping my coffee, I also check the wire services and a couple of specialized news services to which I subscribe, then glance at the latest weather report. This ritual is repeated whenever I have a spare moment during the day (7).   Like many others, Mitchell thinks of his everyday use of the Internet as a ritual. This is a clear indication that it may be useful to examine cyberspace from a ritual perspective. David Tomas proposes that such a treatment \"allows us to make sense of an advanced information technology that has the potential to not only change the economic structure of human societies but also overthrow the sensorial and organic architecture of the human body, this by disembodying and reformatting its sensorium in powerful, computer-generated, digitalized spaces.\" (32)    If we are to take this route we must look, as Tomas does, at Arnold Van Gennep's seminal work Les Rites de Passage . 3  Van Gennep was the first anthropologist to write a detailed study about specific rituals that mark major individual or collective social stages. Significantly he explains that,   although a complete scheme of rites of passage theoretically includes preliminal rites (rites of separation), liminal rites (rites of transition), and postliminal rites (rites of incorporation), in specific instances these three types are not always equally important or equally elaborated (11).   Since Van Gennep's theory has been applied mainly to 'identifiable' social structures it may not appear to be so obviously applicable to the \"nonspace\" of cyberspace. However, through his own explaination we can still argue that, as Tomas puts it, \"there are a number of similarities between the overall structure of rites of passages and cyberspace that suggest that the latter might be closely related to the former in a functional sense\"(40). The action, or rather encounter-interaction-exchange, which occurs in the 'rituals' of cyberspace is the focus of the similarities. Tomas explains the various points of contact within this parallelism very clearly:   First, the action of \"jacking in\" and out of cyberspace by way of cyberdecks and matrix simulators suggest radically truncated versions of seperation and aggregation \"rites\" in which the hardware serves as a portal to, and exit from, a parallel virtual reality. [] Second, jacking into cyberspace involves a passage from the everyday space and finite time of the organically human or postorganic hardware-based cyborg to a digital - as opposed to analogical - space and time that is both transorganic and cyberpsychically collective (40).   The passage is between the organic human body-mind and cyberphysical self as reconfigured through the computer hardware and software systems necessary for navigation in cyberspace. Note that I maintain that the passage is between the organic and the electronic, and not unidirectional. \"We interact with these spaces, sending our virtual prosthetics into the limen for re-configuration, forcing a process of simultaneous separation and re-aggregation\" (Morle, 1996b). The body-mind is changed by the electronic experience as much as the virtual self 'projected' in cyberspace is determined by the body-mind it emanates from.    Is it coincidental that the interactive performance journal of which Phil Morle is the managing editor is called Limen ? As he points out in Virtuality , \"Within this world we struggle to reach the transcendent relentlessly searching for gateways into the new domain; the liminal becomes the primary reality and our need for the transcendent world-in-itself disappears.\" (1996b) A theory of performance based on ritual has been elaborated through Victor Turner. 4  On the creative aspect of liminality, Turner claims that it is \"a realm of pure possibility whence novel configurations of ideas and relations may arise\" (1967: 97). If we accept encounter-interaction-exchange in cyberspace as a liminal experience, its performative nature is evidently \"creative\" too.    Terri Senft refers to the Internet as a metaphorical hallucination, while Phil Morle likens performance to Gibson's image of cyberspace as a consensual hallucination, claiming that \"performance is not something performers do and spectators watch - it is Gibson's 'consensual hallucination' created in the virtuality of the liminal space\" (1996c) This is undoubtedly because \"cyberspace's inherent immateriality and malleability of content provides the most tempting stage for the acting out of mythic realities, realities once \"confined\" to drug-enhanced ritual, to theater, painting, books, and to such media that are always, in themselves, somehow less than what they reach for, mere gateways\" (Benedikt: 6).    Performance cannot concentrate solely on the virtual. We are enveloped by the virtual in ways which are mostly electronic, and therefore possibly unrecognizable. Virtuality must share its nature of being with the so-called real world in the experience we call performance. The performative in cyberspace is essentially the encounter-interaction-exchange that occurs whenever the virtual aspects of reality are reconfigured by the body-mind.    Is cyberspace a new social space? Undoubtedly, yes. Is my encounter with Phil Morle (and his work) an example of performativity in cyberspace? Yes again. And I insist on this not in spite of but because of the fact that the experience has been very valuable in shaping my chosen paths since then. It is also one which is now helping me articulate better what I believe to be performative about cyberspace.   December 1996    Manhattan, NY          Sources and references:    Austin, J.L.

Search:             Editorial Statement    The goals of JOE, The Journal for Online Education, are to encourage   and document creativity in online education,    optimal mindbody conditioning in cyberspace   culture, and cultural diversity in global communication   in a range of discourse from abstract, esoteric articles in academic styles,   cutting edge experimental research, news articles, business reports, creative   writing and art work to the stories and drawings of children. The journal   is not organized by discipline but seeks to develop new paradigms of thought   by developing multi-, inter-, cross-, and trans-disciplinary and anti-disciplinary   activities in basic adventure and problem areas related to cyberspace. The   WWW Journal of Online Education is inclusive but experimental, and therefore   seeks the most original, provocative submissions possible. The mission of   the WWW Journal of Online Education is to turn us all into intellectual activists,   to provide access and quality education to all people around the world, to   develop and condition our physiology and kinesiology so that our meat doesn't   rot in cyberspace, and to preserve freedom of expression, inquiry, creativity   and cultural integrity as technology continues to develop. Although JOE is   based in New York, its audience is global. In his keynote address, \"Online   Education as a New Professional Discipline\" at the TCC98 online conference   (organized by Jim Shimabukuro), Professor Steve McCarty writes: \"The future   will thus be a co-creation of Westerners and non-Westerners.\"     GUIDELINES for the WWW Journal of Online Education    Subject Matter: We accept anything related   to teaching or researching online or in cyber-enhanced classes anywhere in   the world; or how traditional knowledge and/or conventional cognitive processing   are enhanced, destroyed and transformed by the medium of cyberspace.

THE BRAIN GYM (cross-disciplinary articles   to solve the problem of how to make our brains work better)                   This section includes academic APA articles on hard-core cognitive     science addressing the issues of how the brain processes, remembers,     creates and forgets information in cyberspace, as well as hypothetical     and experimental articles on the metaphorical comparison to exercise     physiology and application of different cognitive domains to the wild     west of cyberspace. Creativity needs rules and structures but when and     how do we break these rules to enhance our thinking, charting new territory     in those cerebral fissures, increasing our synaptic connections? What     are the connections between mental and physical conditioning? We encourage     the submission of nonlinear experiments, games, poetry, artwork and     stories to encourage synchronicity between right and left brain functions.The     brain gym paradigm continues with creative ways to make learning fun     for children.           &quot;Hi-Tech   Online Anthem to Creativity&quot; by Mihkel Pilv    Motivation in Filmmaking by Zach Golden     Cognitive Development and Cognitive Domain: Connecting the Paths to Success by Rachel Hanley       II: How does the Internet Change the Way We   Think?

If information is simple, clear, accessible, and &quot;dumbed down,&quot;   it will be easy to distribute all over the world, to even the most impoverished,   illiterate group of people. In some ways this is good. It gives everyone in   the global community a baseline of knowledge, a common language. But now we   are not only compromising creativity, but also global diversity.

New York University. May 1995. Author: Mona de Vestel &ndash; Assistant Professor of Writing &amp; New Media. SUNY Institute of Technology.   In a time when flesh is lethal, what does it mean for us to turn on our computers to touch one another? What does it mean for us to spend our time in a state of disembodiment? Whether it is online or in the dimension of virtual reality, we become bodiless.    Mundus Imaginalis: Time in Cyberspace by   Mona de Vestel , 2009   Temporality, the thread of time, is in fact the container for the demarcation of real or   imagined events in our lives. Historically, philosophers have crystallized the definitions of time   within parameters of succession. Western philosophy indulges in the inflated importance given to   the notion of the past and the grandiose role it plays in referencing our modes of temporal   existence.          &ldquo; Virtual&rdquo; Honesty: The Chains of Technology by Courtney Graham, December 2007           Photo:   Albert Lung     How do we present ourselves to others in cyberspace? Do we lose   our \"souls\" in virtual communities or discover parts of our unconscious we   were not aware of? Does this WWW global magazine virtualize the archetypes   of the Jungian collective unconscious? When does the internet become a destructive   addiction? Is privacy still important in the global age and if so, how do   we preserve it? Is there such a thing as cyber-fright, like stage-fright or   writers block, or does the nature of the medium encourage us to let it \"all   hang out\"? How does the Western concept of self conflict with the non-Western   sense of state and community, or even &quot;soul&quot;? Creativity demands   a respect for the self, a Western concept in terms of material goals, but   an Eastern one when developing spiritual goals. The self is messy, complicated,   chaotic and contradictory, as all of you who have studied Jung and Freud,   or even remembered your own dreams, know. Where is the place in our online   educational model for the &quot;deepspace&quot; of the unconscious?

Search:             Editorial Statement    The goals of JOE, The Journal for Online Education, are to encourage   and document creativity in online education,    optimal mindbody conditioning in cyberspace   culture, and cultural diversity in global communication   in a range of discourse from abstract, esoteric articles in academic styles,   cutting edge experimental research, news articles, business reports, creative   writing and art work to the stories and drawings of children. The journal   is not organized by discipline but seeks to develop new paradigms of thought   by developing multi-, inter-, cross-, and trans-disciplinary and anti-disciplinary   activities in basic adventure and problem areas related to cyberspace. The   WWW Journal of Online Education is inclusive but experimental, and therefore   seeks the most original, provocative submissions possible. The mission of   the WWW Journal of Online Education is to turn us all into intellectual activists,   to provide access and quality education to all people around the world, to   develop and condition our physiology and kinesiology so that our meat doesn't   rot in cyberspace, and to preserve freedom of expression, inquiry, creativity   and cultural integrity as technology continues to develop. Although JOE is   based in New York, its audience is global. In his keynote address, \"Online   Education as a New Professional Discipline\" at the TCC98 online conference   (organized by Jim Shimabukuro), Professor Steve McCarty writes: \"The future   will thus be a co-creation of Westerners and non-Westerners.\"     GUIDELINES for the WWW Journal of Online Education    Subject Matter: We accept anything related   to teaching or researching online or in cyber-enhanced classes anywhere in   the world; or how traditional knowledge and/or conventional cognitive processing   are enhanced, destroyed and transformed by the medium of cyberspace.

THE BRAIN GYM (cross-disciplinary articles   to solve the problem of how to make our brains work better)                   This section includes academic APA articles on hard-core cognitive     science addressing the issues of how the brain processes, remembers,     creates and forgets information in cyberspace, as well as hypothetical     and experimental articles on the metaphorical comparison to exercise     physiology and application of different cognitive domains to the wild     west of cyberspace. Creativity needs rules and structures but when and     how do we break these rules to enhance our thinking, charting new territory     in those cerebral fissures, increasing our synaptic connections? What     are the connections between mental and physical conditioning? We encourage     the submission of nonlinear experiments, games, poetry, artwork and     stories to encourage synchronicity between right and left brain functions.The     brain gym paradigm continues with creative ways to make learning fun     for children.           &quot;Hi-Tech   Online Anthem to Creativity&quot; by Mihkel Pilv    Motivation in Filmmaking by Zach Golden     Cognitive Development and Cognitive Domain: Connecting the Paths to Success by Rachel Hanley       II: How does the Internet Change the Way We   Think?

If information is simple, clear, accessible, and &quot;dumbed down,&quot;   it will be easy to distribute all over the world, to even the most impoverished,   illiterate group of people. In some ways this is good. It gives everyone in   the global community a baseline of knowledge, a common language. But now we   are not only compromising creativity, but also global diversity.

New York University. May 1995. Author: Mona de Vestel &ndash; Assistant Professor of Writing &amp; New Media. SUNY Institute of Technology.   In a time when flesh is lethal, what does it mean for us to turn on our computers to touch one another? What does it mean for us to spend our time in a state of disembodiment? Whether it is online or in the dimension of virtual reality, we become bodiless.    Mundus Imaginalis: Time in Cyberspace by   Mona de Vestel , 2009   Temporality, the thread of time, is in fact the container for the demarcation of real or   imagined events in our lives. Historically, philosophers have crystallized the definitions of time   within parameters of succession. Western philosophy indulges in the inflated importance given to   the notion of the past and the grandiose role it plays in referencing our modes of temporal   existence.          &ldquo; Virtual&rdquo; Honesty: The Chains of Technology by Courtney Graham, December 2007           Photo:   Albert Lung     How do we present ourselves to others in cyberspace? Do we lose   our \"souls\" in virtual communities or discover parts of our unconscious we   were not aware of? Does this WWW global magazine virtualize the archetypes   of the Jungian collective unconscious? When does the internet become a destructive   addiction? Is privacy still important in the global age and if so, how do   we preserve it? Is there such a thing as cyber-fright, like stage-fright or   writers block, or does the nature of the medium encourage us to let it \"all   hang out\"? How does the Western concept of self conflict with the non-Western   sense of state and community, or even &quot;soul&quot;? Creativity demands   a respect for the self, a Western concept in terms of material goals, but   an Eastern one when developing spiritual goals. The self is messy, complicated,   chaotic and contradictory, as all of you who have studied Jung and Freud,   or even remembered your own dreams, know. Where is the place in our online   educational model for the &quot;deepspace&quot; of the unconscious? What studies   are being done on how the internet affects pathologies such as attention deficit   disorder, autism and manic depression?      How can children protect themselves against predators but still express themselves   and have fun?     &quot;Elephant   Surveillance to Thought&quot;   by Andrew Levy, Ph.D.     THE BODY IN CYBERSPACE (cross-disciplinary   articles to investigate mindbody duality in cyberspace)                 This section includes     philosophical and cultural discussions of the representation, deconstruction     and duality of the mindbody in cyberspace.

Will societies always reward and worship models, movie and pop stars more    than educators,or will cyberspace improve the social status of professors?

Hultin, President of the Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly), told students in the Pfizer Auditorium at the second Sloan Cyber Security Lecture. In his opening remarks, Hultin stressed a simple point: a career in cyber security equals job security. Hultin also called for more women to consider it, citing the day&rsquo;s Distinguished Lecturer, Debora Plunkett, Director of the Information Assurance Directorate for the National Security Agency, as an example. &ldquo;She has a career we can all try to emulate,&rdquo; Hultin said.     In her lecture, Plunkett echoed the sentiment: &ldquo;I need fresh legs, and I see a lot of them here in the room.&rdquo; Plunkett, whose role involves defending national security systems, addressed emerging cyber security threats and mitigation strategy: with more technology used every day, &ldquo;the more we need to protect it.&rdquo; She focused on defining emerging threats, why we should study them, and &ldquo;what opportunities exist for you as you leave this institution and go out into the work world.&rdquo;     Her concluding remarks emphasized the broad spectrum of new and growing threats, and that effective response strategies must target both the attacker and defender motivations. Academia and business must work together to respond effectively, crossing lines between &ldquo;government, industry, and infrastructure.&rdquo;     A panel discussion featuring Hamilton William J. Wansley, Senior VP at Booz Allen, and Bill Phelps, a Managing Director in Accenture&rsquo;s security practice, followed the lecture. During the panel, moderated by Professor Nasir Memon, Phelps echoed Plunkett&rsquo;s call to protecting cyberspace: we need to &ldquo;build a fence to keep people out,&rdquo; moving beyond defense. &ldquo;For all the students, you&rsquo;re in a great place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is zero unemployment in cyber security.&rdquo;     In the hallway outside the Pfizer auditorium, students displayed posters highlighting their research in cyber security and dealing with threats and attacks. &ldquo;Survivable Key Compromise in Software Update Systems,&rdquo; by a group of students including NYU-Poly Vladimir Diaz and Konstantin Andrianov demonstrated the danger of compromise in software updates via a chart with principles for &ldquo;Designing for Survivability.&rdquo;     Jeyavijayan (JV) Rajendran, a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering who is researching Integrated Circuit Security, said &ldquo;The Sloan lecture was great,&rdquo; Rajendran added. It gave him &ldquo;excellent feedback about our research&rdquo; and &ldquo;an experience about how to convey our research ideas effectively to others who might not be aware of that problem.&rdquo;     &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a huge demand for cyber security right now, across the board,&rdquo; said James Sillcox, Director of NYU-Poly&rsquo;s Wasserman Center for Career Development. &ldquo;The problems evolve and the solutions evolve with them.

Search:             Editorial Statement    The goals of JOE, The Journal for Online Education, are to encourage   and document creativity in online education,    optimal mindbody conditioning in cyberspace   culture, and cultural diversity in global communication   in a range of discourse from abstract, esoteric articles in academic styles,   cutting edge experimental research, news articles, business reports, creative   writing and art work to the stories and drawings of children. The journal   is not organized by discipline but seeks to develop new paradigms of thought   by developing multi-, inter-, cross-, and trans-disciplinary and anti-disciplinary   activities in basic adventure and problem areas related to cyberspace. The   WWW Journal of Online Education is inclusive but experimental, and therefore   seeks the most original, provocative submissions possible. The mission of   the WWW Journal of Online Education is to turn us all into intellectual activists,   to provide access and quality education to all people around the world, to   develop and condition our physiology and kinesiology so that our meat doesn't   rot in cyberspace, and to preserve freedom of expression, inquiry, creativity   and cultural integrity as technology continues to develop. Although JOE is   based in New York, its audience is global. In his keynote address, \"Online   Education as a New Professional Discipline\" at the TCC98 online conference   (organized by Jim Shimabukuro), Professor Steve McCarty writes: \"The future   will thus be a co-creation of Westerners and non-Westerners.\"     GUIDELINES for the WWW Journal of Online Education    Subject Matter: We accept anything related   to teaching or researching online or in cyber-enhanced classes anywhere in   the world; or how traditional knowledge and/or conventional cognitive processing   are enhanced, destroyed and transformed by the medium of cyberspace.

Creativity needs rules and structures but when and     how do we break these rules to enhance our thinking, charting new territory     in those cerebral fissures, increasing our synaptic connections? What     are the connections between mental and physical conditioning?

In a time when flesh is lethal, what does it mean for us to turn on our computers to touch one another? What does it mean for us to spend our time in a state of disembodiment? Whether it is online or in the dimension of virtual reality, we become bodiless.    Mundus Imaginalis: Time in Cyberspace by   Mona de Vestel , 2009   Temporality, the thread of time, is in fact the container for the demarcation of real or   imagined events in our lives. Historically, philosophers have crystallized the definitions of time   within parameters of succession. Western philosophy indulges in the inflated importance given to   the notion of the past and the grandiose role it plays in referencing our modes of temporal   existence.          &ldquo; Virtual&rdquo; Honesty: The Chains of Technology by Courtney Graham, December 2007           Photo:   Albert Lung     How do we present ourselves to others in cyberspace?

What is performative about cyberspace?    A response by Toni Sant        \"Cyberspace exists, insofar as it can be said to exist, by virtue of human agency.\"    (William Gibson, Mona Lisa Overdrive : 107)       The 'mind' is not a separate entity from the 'body'. Mind-without-body and body-without-mind is not what we mean when we say 'mind' or 'body'. The 'body-mind' is where the 'mind' and the 'body' fulfill their ontology. Similarly, what is commonly accepted as 'reality' is not be taken to be the diametrical opposite of 'virtuality'. Virtual reality is not an oxymoron.    This paper introduces an articulation of my personal exploration of the performative aspects of cyberspace. By declaring my convictions on the body-mind and the reality of the virtual, I am presenting an a priori setting for my investigation. It is within this value-system that I operate as a professionally-trained broadcaster, a 'licensed' theatre-maker, and a graduate student of performance studies. With this paper I am attempting to find a space within which my training and my academic interests can be recombined towards a reality that makes my research and my practice come so close to each other that they function as one, like my body-mind.    The body-mind is the organic body, yet there exists a virtual body; a body without organs. The relationship between these two bodies is one of the best resources for performance material (Critical Art Ensemble: 69). Anthropologist David Tomas proposes \"parallels that can be drawn between the postindustrial, cyberspatial transubstantiation of the human body and related social and symbolic transformations of the human body in traditional rites de passage rituals.\" (36) I shall use his theory to examine the transubstantiation of my own body-mind to what is known and recognized as cyberspace.    The concept of encounter is particularly important for anyone studying performance. It is central to any performance, even when the exchange is not between organic bodies in the same space at the same time. Like the Critical Art Ensemble I believe that \"[performance] has become the site of mediation, not so much between social relationships proper, but between the concrete and the virtual worlds, the sedentary and the nomadic, the organic and the electronic, and the present and the absent\" (68-69). This immediately presents us with a vital link which can help us blur out all the dualistic elements and Cartesian arguments that instantly attempt to invade the scenario.    A fundamental (\" in principio erat Verbum et Verbum erat apud Deum et Deus erat Verbum \") discourse on performativity was proposed by linguistic theorist J.L. Austin in 1955. He indicates two types of verbal utterance: the \"constative\" and the \"performative\". The constative refers to descriptive language; this category is not of immediate interest to us.) Austin defines the performative as \"derived, of course, from 'perform', the usual verb which is the noun 'action': it indicates that the issuing of the utterance is the performing of an action - it is not normally thought of as just saying something\"(6-7). Thus we speak of \"a performative utterance\" as the single most powerful unit of Austian performativity. The performative utterance is so very powerful because, as Austin suggests, it creates the organic/everyday world.    During a preliminary exercise dealing with the same question posed in the title to this paper, I constructed a practical experiment based on my encounter with the presence of a particular body in cyberspace known as Leonardo da Vinci. My Leonardo web-pages were an experiment into the possibilities of a hypertext as a recombinant cyber-performance. The red and green buttons on the gateway to the website and the performative \"I shall not return...\" and \"I promise to explore all the links\" were my attempt to create obvious Austinian concepts which could articulate themselves in cyberspace.    I have a strong resistance to thinking about the term performative as being only what Austin says it is. My opposition is mainly derived from the way I have been academically instructed to devalue the spoken word in performance contexts; especially if written in the form of dramatic literature. With the Internet, words have acquired a value which was negated to them by non-literary studies of theatre and other forms of theatrical performance. Thus, taking Austin's theory as a springboard for a re-evaluation of performativity, I propose that the essential elements of the performative act are:      encounter-interaction-exchange     not as separate circumstances but as inseparable qualities of performativity. The performative act is a convergence of these actions as one. Encounter: a coming together of at least two bodies. Interaction: action which is somehow always in re-action. Exchange: constant change is imperative, ex- stasis, ecstacy, in search of a virtual reality.    In its discussion on The Recombinant Theater and the Performative Matrix , the Critical Art Ensemble has made me realize that organic space corresponds to Austin's \"constative\", and that cyberspace is necessarily \"performative\" by its very nature (57-79). This becomes even more evident when the terrain of \"cyberspace\" is mapped out in a precise manner with the intention of finding the various possibilities to understanding some of its performative aspects.    The term \"cyberspace\" is attributed to William Gibson who in his novel Neuromancer  (1984) speculated about the role of computers and hackers in the future:   Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical conceptsA graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding(51)   We should not be mislead to think of cyberspace as a specific physical place. It seems that the meaning, if not the structure, of cyberspace has somewhat evolved since Gibson first outlined it. The on-line hacker Jargon File, version 3.1.0, 15 OCT 1994 has an entry for the term which looks something like this:  Cyberspace /si:'ber-spays/ n.   1. Notional 'information-space' loaded with visual cues and navigable with brain-computer interfaces called 'cyberspace decks'; a characteristic prop of cyberpunk. At the time of this writing (mid-1991), serious efforts to construct virtual reality interfaces modeled explicitly on Gibsonian cyberspace are already under way, using more conventional devices such as glove sensors and binocular TV headsets.   Over time the term has come to signify a specific nonspace, unaffected by the cyberpunk. Consider the claims made by two of the scholars whose research work informs mine.   David Tomas: \"cyberspace is a postindustrial work environment predicted on a new hardwired communications interface that provides a direct and total sensorial access to a parallel world of potential work spaces\"(35).    Phil Morle: \"'Cyberspace' is not just another word for 'virtual reality' but is a particular manifestation of it. It is created the moment the human being encounters itself, or others, virtually with mediating technology such as computers, TVs, videos, and telephones - where interaction with the world is through a technological interface\"(1996b).   As far as I'm concerned, all communication between two or more parties done through a computer interface is performed in cyberspace. Thus, when I insert a floppy disk or a CD-ROM into my computer and read whatever is on it, I am interfacing with the creator(s) of whatever is on that disk; even though the information transmitted through diskettes and CDs has preset parameters. When the contents call for interactivity, we enter the sphere of the performative in cyberspace.    Since the Internet is steadily assimilating all mediating technology, cyberspace now implies communicaton over the Internet more than through any other medium. Performative elements related to cyberspace outside the cyberspatial sphere of the Internet are beyond my current interests. Their exclusion is of no immediate consequence to my research, and I am aware of the fact that cyberspace, even as I have just explained it, precedes the Internet.    Before we go any further, I must stress that it is essential that we do not think of the Internet as a specific physical place. In her introduction to the special issue of Women &amp; Performance on Sexuality and Cyberspace (Fall 1996), Theresa Senft explains the nature of the Internet very eloquently:   Properly speaking, the Internet is not a thing at all, but rather the effect of millions of performances called \"packet switching.\" In packet switching, messages are sent out via modem from one computer to a \"switching node\" where they are then divided into workable units. The units are, in turn, transmitted to their destination and reassembled. Packet switching protocol requires a series of computer and telephone calculations, occurring in many different locations around the world, simultaneously. The effect of packet switching, what we call \"The Internet,\" then, is really a series of cooperative performance gestures from multiple computer and telephone systems. The Net functions in a way that the telephone alone (because it operates on a dedicated circuit) does not. Although there is a thing called \"the telephone,\" there is not, properly speaking, a place called the Internet. Rather, the Net's status as a place is a metaphorical hallucination, although an understandably useful one.   The Internet is a preeminent virtual space, and its nature is constantly being re-created by every person who taps into it to impart or search for information. It is fundamentally pluralistic and embraces differing and often conflicting positions. Surprisingly, Baudrillard maintains that \" le virtuel n'est peut-&ecirc;tre pas une forme universelle de vie mais une singularit&eacute; .\" 1  This view works out in the context of the Internet only if we recognize that it is \"a singularity\" in constant flux. And, although five years have passed since Michael Benedikt declared that \"cyberspace itself is an elusive and future thing, and one can hardly be definitive at this early stage\"(22), we are still far from being \"definitive\" about it.    My first encounter with an academic idea of performance and cyberspace happened during the winter of 1994/95 when I discovered Phil Morle's Communitek: Performance at the Electronic Frontier at the website for the Center of Theatre Practice. 2  I was intrigued by this work and the rest of the material at the site, particularly because I felt that Kaos Theatre , of which Phil Morle is the artistic director, and Platonium, the performance group I work with in a similar capacity, shared a set of common values. In spite of this, a series of email messages to and from Morle developed into what I believe to be a misunderstanding of each other's intentions. At the time I did not possess the basic technical/academic knowledge to clarify my thoughts to him through cyberspace. I failed to recognize a basic principle which Morle himself presents so clearly in Communitek : \"The first mistakeis to consider this new medium in the same way, and with the same rules as the one we are currently working in\" (1995a).    It is also possible that the miscommunication arose from the \"abstracted representations of self and the body, separate from the individual, [which] are simultaneously present in numerous locations, interacting and recombining with others, beyond the control of the individual\" (Critical Art Ensemble: 58). But, if they are \"beyond the control of the individual,\" where is the matrix of control? Is it determined by chance in the same way that two live performances of the same 'theatrical production' are never exactly the same? Phil Morle's words resonate with deeper meaning now.   I am starting to use the term 'Communitek' rather than 'theatre' so that we do not get confused. I am not talking about grafting existing artforms onto new media I am talking about new environments for interactions - new artforms - new entertainments - new media. The structures we will eventually create for Cyberspace over the next ten years are yet to be designed (1995a).   Regardless of Morle's call for new terminology and \"new environments for interaction, we often think of cyberspace in terms of ritual, one of the primary loci for performance studies. One expressive articulation of this nature is presented by William J. Mitchell in his 1995 book City of Bits: Space, Place and the Infobahn .   Each morning I turn to some nearby machine to log into electronic mail. I click on an icon to open an \"inbox\" filled with messages from round the worldI type replies immediately, then drop them into an \"outbox,\" from which they are forwarded automatically to the appropriate destinations. [] If I have time before I finish gulping my coffee, I also check the wire services and a couple of specialized news services to which I subscribe, then glance at the latest weather report. This ritual is repeated whenever I have a spare moment during the day (7).   Like many others, Mitchell thinks of his everyday use of the Internet as a ritual. This is a clear indication that it may be useful to examine cyberspace from a ritual perspective. David Tomas proposes that such a treatment \"allows us to make sense of an advanced information technology that has the potential to not only change the economic structure of human societies but also overthrow the sensorial and organic architecture of the human body, this by disembodying and reformatting its sensorium in powerful, computer-generated, digitalized spaces.\" (32)    If we are to take this route we must look, as Tomas does, at Arnold Van Gennep's seminal work Les Rites de Passage . 3  Van Gennep was the first anthropologist to write a detailed study about specific rituals that mark major individual or collective social stages. Significantly he explains that,   although a complete scheme of rites of passage theoretically includes preliminal rites (rites of separation), liminal rites (rites of transition), and postliminal rites (rites of incorporation), in specific instances these three types are not always equally important or equally elaborated (11).   Since Van Gennep's theory has been applied mainly to 'identifiable' social structures it may not appear to be so obviously applicable to the \"nonspace\" of cyberspace. However, through his own explaination we can still argue that, as Tomas puts it, \"there are a number of similarities between the overall structure of rites of passages and cyberspace that suggest that the latter might be closely related to the former in a functional sense\"(40). The action, or rather encounter-interaction-exchange, which occurs in the 'rituals' of cyberspace is the focus of the similarities. Tomas explains the various points of contact within this parallelism very clearly:   First, the action of \"jacking in\" and out of cyberspace by way of cyberdecks and matrix simulators suggest radically truncated versions of seperation and aggregation \"rites\" in which the hardware serves as a portal to, and exit from, a parallel virtual reality. [] Second, jacking into cyberspace involves a passage from the everyday space and finite time of the organically human or postorganic hardware-based cyborg to a digital - as opposed to analogical - space and time that is both transorganic and cyberpsychically collective (40).   The passage is between the organic human body-mind and cyberphysical self as reconfigured through the computer hardware and software systems necessary for navigation in cyberspace. Note that I maintain that the passage is between the organic and the electronic, and not unidirectional. \"We interact with these spaces, sending our virtual prosthetics into the limen for re-configuration, forcing a process of simultaneous separation and re-aggregation\" (Morle, 1996b). The body-mind is changed by the electronic experience as much as the virtual self 'projected' in cyberspace is determined by the body-mind it emanates from.    Is it coincidental that the interactive performance journal of which Phil Morle is the managing editor is called Limen ? As he points out in Virtuality , \"Within this world we struggle to reach the transcendent relentlessly searching for gateways into the new domain; the liminal becomes the primary reality and our need for the transcendent world-in-itself disappears.\" (1996b) A theory of performance based on ritual has been elaborated through Victor Turner. 4  On the creative aspect of liminality, Turner claims that it is \"a realm of pure possibility whence novel configurations of ideas and relations may arise\" (1967: 97). If we accept encounter-interaction-exchange in cyberspace as a liminal experience, its performative nature is evidently \"creative\" too.    Terri Senft refers to the Internet as a metaphorical hallucination, while Phil Morle likens performance to Gibson's image of cyberspace as a consensual hallucination, claiming that \"performance is not something performers do and spectators watch - it is Gibson's 'consensual hallucination' created in the virtuality of the liminal space\" (1996c) This is undoubtedly because \"cyberspace's inherent immateriality and malleability of content provides the most tempting stage for the acting out of mythic realities, realities once \"confined\" to drug-enhanced ritual, to theater, painting, books, and to such media that are always, in themselves, somehow less than what they reach for, mere gateways\" (Benedikt: 6).    Performance cannot concentrate solely on the virtual. We are enveloped by the virtual in ways which are mostly electronic, and therefore possibly unrecognizable. Virtuality must share its nature of being with the so-called real world in the experience we call performance. The performative in cyberspace is essentially the encounter-interaction-exchange that occurs whenever the virtual aspects of reality are reconfigured by the body-mind.    Is cyberspace a new social space? Undoubtedly, yes. Is my encounter with Phil Morle (and his work) an example of performativity in cyberspace? Yes again. And I insist on this not in spite of but because of the fact that the experience has been very valuable in shaping my chosen paths since then. It is also one which is now helping me articulate better what I believe to be performative about cyberspace.   December 1996    Manhattan, NY          Sources and references:    Austin, J.L.
