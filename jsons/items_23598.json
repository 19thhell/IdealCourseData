This course will serve as an introduction to the diverse perspectives that are taught in the NYU Postdoctoral Program by exposing students to the key ideas and concepts, the historical development, and the clinical approach of each of the major orientations or schools. Ethical considerations relevant to psychoanalytic practice will be emphasized. ( Ethics   component of the course )    Writing Psychoanalytically (PDPSA.4553)  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch    This course is designed to be taken concomitant with any other course in the Postdoctoral Program or as an independent study project. It serves as an opportunity to write about a particular topic or question either emerging within another course taken at the same time as this course, or as an independent writing project. It is unique to the program as it offers six classes in which candidates are able to compare and contrast their writing over time and with each other.    Psychoanalytic Supervision (PDPSA.4543)  Instructor: Helen Gediman        This course reviews the present state of psychoanalytic thinking on the supervisory process with major emphases on the supervisory process in a climate of theoretical diversity and heterogeneity and the supervisory process as a triadic system with multiple interactions as the focus. Readings and clinical presentations by students are utilized to illustrate the main issues being studied.            THE HISTORY &amp; DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTORS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4580)    As in the humanities, and unlike some sciences, psychoanalysis must be studied historically. Whatever one\u2019s current point of view, a well-educated analyst must have a solid understanding of Freud\u2019s contributions and texts as well as those of other significant contributors. Often the contributions of seminal psychoanalytic writers must also be studied in conjunction with their school of thought. This course teaches students the theory and practice of psychoanalysis through a study of notable individuals\u2019 contributions, developmentally and historically, as well as by studying the historical development of specific schools of thought. In various semesters or in different sections this course will focus on one contributor or tradition.             The Evolution of Freud\u2019s Thought I, 1895-1915   Instructor: Elliot Kronish      The Evolution of Freud\u2019s Thought II, 1915-1937  Instructor: Elliot Kronish  The Evolution of Interpersonal Psychoanalysis: From Ferenczi, Sullivan and Fromm to Contemporary Psychoanalysis   Instructors: Ann D'Ercole &amp; Barbara Suter   Psychoanalytic History and Changes in Technique: The Place of Interpretation in the Therapeutic Process   Instructor:       The Contemporary Kleinians of London  Instructor: Naama Kushnir Barash    Melanie Klein and Wilfred Bion  Instructor: Michael Eigen          Sandor Ferenczi and Relational Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Jay Frankel    British Object Relations Theory: Fairbairn and Guntrip  Instructor:  Neil Skolnick      Winnicott: The Evolution and Impact of His Work   Instructor: Joyce Slochower    Jungian Ways of Working with Images: Interpretative and Experiential Techniques    Instructor: Michael Vannoy Adams  Hans Loewald and the Emergence of Contemporary Freudian Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Seymour Moscovitz     Introduction to the Work of Jacques Lacan  Instructor: Jeanne Wolff-Bernstein  Individuating the Psychoanalytic Experience: Benjamin Wolstein's Contribution to Theory &amp; Practice  Instructor: Tom Jordan Desire's Voice: Agency, Truth, and Free Association  Instructor: Jill Gentile  The Relational Turn in Psychoanalysis: The Work &amp; Legacy of Stephen A. Mitchell  Instructors: Lewis Aron, Anthony Bass, Ken Corbett, Jody Messler Davies, Adrienne Harris       CLINICAL CASE SEMINARS \u2014 THE PSYCHOANALYTIC RELATIONSHIP: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4581)       Case seminars and careful, detailed monitoring of psychoanalytic process over time are among the hallmarks of clinical psychoanalytic education. This course encourages students to present their own clinical work in detail over time working with feedback from other students and with the guidance of faculty. Depending on the semester or section the focus may be on treatment from a particular theoretical slant or on specific aspects of the treatment.    Clinical Seminar in Psychoanalytic Process  Instructor: Philip Bromberg    Clinical Case Seminar--Doing the Work: The Experience of Analyst and Patient  Instructor: Barbra Locker         Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Jessica Benjamin     The Analytic Relationship: Case Seminar and Clinical Theory  Instructor: Anthony Bass    The Therapeutic Object Relationship  Instructor: Mark Grunes                Countertransference: A Clinical Seminar  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch  Working at the \"Intimate Edge\"  Instructor: Darlene Ehrenberg  Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Continuous Case Seminar: Problems in Early Integration and the Holding Environment  Instructor: Aaron Thaler  Clinical Case Seminar: How Different Theoretical Approaches Inform the Analyst's Direct Clinical Experience with Patients  Instructor: Warren Wilner The Art of Psychoanalysis: A Clinical Case Seminar on Working (and Playing) with the Unconscious  Instructor: Danielle Knafo Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Muriel Dimen    CLINICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISORDERS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4582)         The psychotherapist and psychoanalyst must learn to tailor the treatment to the needs of the individual patient. One factor in individualizing treatment is to take into account diagnostic considerations and various dimensions of psychopathology. This course introduces students to current, sophisticated thinking about how psychoanalysis works with various styles of personality and forms of pathology. Each semester or section will focus on a different category or personality style taught from one or more theoretical perspectives.          Narcissistic States and the Therapeutic Process  Instructor: Sheldon Bach    Treatment of Depressive Conditions  Instructor: Martin Nass       Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse  Instructor: Judith Alpert    Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy with the Person with Psychotic Processes  Instructor: Brian Koehler    Neurotic Personality Organization  Instructor: TBA    Treatment of the Difficult Patient  Instructor: Richard Lasky    Treatment of Borderline and Narcissistic Disorders  Instructor: Isaac Tylim    Selected Issues in Trauma Studies  Instructors: Judith Alpert , Robert Prince , Nina Thomas , &amp; Isaac Tylim    Repetitive Painful States  Instructor: Elliot Kronish    Shame and Narcissism: Developmental Issues and Clinical Approaches  Instructor: Mary Libbey     Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Addictive Disorders: Integrating Contemporary Theory and Traditional Treatment Approaches  Instructor: Debra Rothschild    Adult Onset Trauma  Instructor: Ghislaine Boulanger  An Object Relations Theory Approach to Technical Challenges  Instructor: Monica Carsky  When the Body Has a Mind of Its Own: An Interpersonal Approach to Eating Disorders  Instructor: Jean Petrucelli  Ghosts in the Consulting Room: A Seminar on Repetitive (Re)Enactments  Instructor: Margery Kalb  Clinical &amp; Theoretical Issues in the Treatment of Pathological Dissociation &amp; DID   Instructors: Elizabeth Howell &amp; Sheldon Itzkowitz  Treating Forms of Catastrophic Anxiety in Analytic Work  Instructor: Marvin Hurvich  Narcissism in the Interactive Matrix: Contemporary Perspectives on Technique  Instructor: Sarah Schoen   THE STUDY &amp; CLINICAL USE OF DREAMS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4583)        The origins of psychoanalysis go back to Freud\u2019s study of his own and his patients\u2019 dreams and to his first major work, The Interpretation of Dreams . This course introduces students to current theories of dreaming, empirical research on dreaming, and clinical work with dreams. Each semester or section will focus on a specific aspect of dreams, such as methodology for dream interpretation or comparative study of dream theories.           Clinical Seminar on Dreams  Instructor: Mark Blechner    Current Perspectives on Dreaming: Theory, Research and Practice  Instructor: James Fosshage   COMPARATIVE PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4584)    Contemporary psychoanalysis is diverse and pluralistic, some might even say fragmented into various schools and theories. This course examines psychoanalytic theories and clinical practices using a model of \u201ccomparative psychoanalysis.\u201d Theories and practices are examined historically, compared along the lines of theoretical and clinical issues, and compared for their implications in the treatment situation. Readings and course discussions add complexity and depth to the student\u2019s sense of the contributions and limitations of each model for clinical practice.       Comparative Analysis of Major Contemporary Orientations  Instructor: Warren Wilner    Comparative theories of Therapeutic Action  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch    On Termination: Theoretical, Technical and Relational Considerations  Instructor: Jill Salberg  Inter-Orientation Case Seminar  Instructor: Barbara Dusansky  A Clinical Approach to Transforming Enactment  Instructor: Michael Varga   Comparing Models of Intersubjectivity from Different Theoretical Perspectives  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch  Relational Practice: An Integrative Psychoanalytic Perspective   Instructor: Paul Wachtel   Theoretical Pluralism and the Working Clinician  Instructor: Fred Pine   Comparative Models in Psychoanalytic Theory  Instructor: Steven Ellman    Our Bodies, Our Patients' Bodies, the Dance  Instructors: Katie Gentile , Steven Knoblauch , &amp; Sue Shapiro  Transformations of Agency: Theory and Clinical Phenomenology  Instructor: Jill Gentile  Clinical Implications of the Cognitive Neuroscience Revolution  Instructor: Michael Moskowitz  Psychotherapy Integration: CBT &amp; Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Jill Bresler  Mourning as Transformation: the Creative Edge of Traumatic &amp; \"Ordinary Loss\"  Instructor: Donna Bassin       PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY &amp; TECHNIQUE: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4585)      This course focuses on the intricate and complex relationship between theory and clinical technique. How do we understand the psychoanalytic method? What are the technical implications of diverse theories? What is the relationship between theory and technique and when can theory aid or interfere in treatment? Each semester or section will examine a specific theory and its application in depth and detail.            Theory of Psychoanalytic Technique I  Instructor: Andrew Druck   Theory of Psychoanalytic Technique II  Instructor: Andrew Druck  Relational Concepts: An Integrative Seminar  Instructor: Jody Davies  Fundamentals of the Psychoanalytic Situation  Instructor: Lisa Director  Introduction to Relational Models of Psychoanalysis and Their Implications for Treatment  Instructor: Jeremy Safran  Relational Self Psychology: Essential Contributions  Instructor: Carolyn Clement  Relational Self Psychology: Contemporary Trends in Relational Self Psychology: Theories &amp; Clinical Applications  Instructor: James Fosshage  The Analysis of Conflict in Contemporary Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice  Instructor: Stanley Grand  Interaction in Psychoanalysis: Transference, Countertransference, and Enactment  Instructor: Gil Katz   Psyche-Soma and Soma-Psyche: The Foregrounded Body in Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice  Instructor: Sharone Bergner  Hate, Envy, and Destructiveness  Instructor: Sue Grand   Constructivism and the Psychoanalytic Situation  Instructor: Donnel Stern   Subjectivity and Intersubjectivity in Relational Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Bruce Reis  Dialectical Constructivism I  Instructor: Irwin Z.

From this point of view, psychoanalysis itself can be critiqued as constructing and constraining such discourses. In addition, psychoanalysis is viewed as part of the larger mental health system, with all its social welfare and social control functions. But psychoanalysis can also function in service of social critique, as when it offers understandings of socio-economic-political structures that are concealed in the surface of ordinary discourses. These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.                Psychoanalysis and Politics  Instructor: Steven Botticelli  More Than Personal: Political and Spiritual Dimensions of the Therapeutic Relationship  Instructor: Andrew Samuels   Race, Racism and Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren  Psychoanalysis and Buddhism: Phenomenological, Spiritual, and Cultural Issues  Instructor: Sara Weber &amp; William Auerbach  Dissociation and Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Foundations of Intersubjectivity: An Introduction to the Philosophy that Grounds Relational Thinking  Instructor: Jack Foehl Psychoanalysis &amp; Religious Narratives: The Christian Narrative  Instructor: Marie Hoffman  Psychoanalysis &amp; Cultural Studies  Instructors: Steven Botticelli &amp; Katie Gentile  Dissociation &amp; Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Social Identities: Race, Class, Gender &amp; Sexuality  Instructor: Melanie Suchet &amp; Cleonie White  The Politics of Psychoanalysis &amp; the Psychoanalysis of Politics  Instructor: Nancy Hollander        GENDER &amp; SEXUALITY: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4587)       Historically, aspects of psychoanalysis were rooted in 19 th century cultural assumptions about sexuality and gender. Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.                 Autogynephilia, Barebacking, Cisgenderism: Can We Talk (about Gender &amp; Sexuality)?  Instructor: Jack Drescher   Gender and Psychoanalysis: History, Critique, Queering &amp; Complicating (NB: instructor is in the process of updating the readings)  Instructor: Virginia Goldner  Sexuality in Relational Perspective  Instructor: TBA Advanced Seminar on Sexuality in Relational Perspective   Instructor: Muriel Dimen  The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman  Comparative Perspectives on Sexuality: Theoretical &amp; Clinical Perspectives  Instructor: Galit Atlas (Koch)       DEVELOPMENTAL &amp; LIFE SPAN ISSUES: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4588)       The genetic and epigenetic (developmental) points of view have long been important to psychoanalysis. Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.               Developmental Perspectives in Psychoanalysis: Infancy through Latency  Instructor: Neal Vorus   Adolescence in Development &amp; Adult Treatment  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren   The Analytic Process &amp; the Process of Development: Emerging Developmental Perspectives &amp; the Actuality of Analytic Work  Instructor: Susan Warshaw Developmental Issues in the Analytic Setting  Instructor: Adrienne Harris Object Loss in Clinical Practice   Instructor: TBA The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality, and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman   Coupling: An Interpersonal Perspective on Adult Development and Intimacy  Instructor: Mary-Joan Gerson   The Developmental Lens and Adult Analytic Work  Instructor: Katherine Oram   Anxiety, Envy, Shame &amp; the Developmental Process  Instructor: Christopher Bonovitz       INFANCY &amp; PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4589)       The past several decades have seen an explosion of research on infancy, and the findings of infancy research have had a significant impact on psychoanalytic theory and practice. Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.

Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.

Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.

Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

This course will serve as an introduction to the diverse perspectives that are taught in the NYU Postdoctoral Program by exposing students to the key ideas and concepts, the historical development, and the clinical approach of each of the major orientations or schools. Ethical considerations relevant to psychoanalytic practice will be emphasized. ( Ethics   component of the course )    Writing Psychoanalytically (PDPSA.4553)  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch    This course is designed to be taken concomitant with any other course in the Postdoctoral Program or as an independent study project. It serves as an opportunity to write about a particular topic or question either emerging within another course taken at the same time as this course, or as an independent writing project. It is unique to the program as it offers six classes in which candidates are able to compare and contrast their writing over time and with each other.    Psychoanalytic Supervision (PDPSA.4543)  Instructor: Helen Gediman        This course reviews the present state of psychoanalytic thinking on the supervisory process with major emphases on the supervisory process in a climate of theoretical diversity and heterogeneity and the supervisory process as a triadic system with multiple interactions as the focus. Readings and clinical presentations by students are utilized to illustrate the main issues being studied.            THE HISTORY &amp; DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTORS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4580)    As in the humanities, and unlike some sciences, psychoanalysis must be studied historically. Whatever one\u2019s current point of view, a well-educated analyst must have a solid understanding of Freud\u2019s contributions and texts as well as those of other significant contributors. Often the contributions of seminal psychoanalytic writers must also be studied in conjunction with their school of thought. This course teaches students the theory and practice of psychoanalysis through a study of notable individuals\u2019 contributions, developmentally and historically, as well as by studying the historical development of specific schools of thought. In various semesters or in different sections this course will focus on one contributor or tradition.

This course encourages students to present their own clinical work in detail over time working with feedback from other students and with the guidance of faculty. Depending on the semester or section the focus may be on treatment from a particular theoretical slant or on specific aspects of the treatment.

One factor in individualizing treatment is to take into account diagnostic considerations and various dimensions of psychopathology. This course introduces students to current, sophisticated thinking about how psychoanalysis works with various styles of personality and forms of pathology. Each semester or section will focus on a different category or personality style taught from one or more theoretical perspectives.

This course introduces students to current theories of dreaming, empirical research on dreaming, and clinical work with dreams. Each semester or section will focus on a specific aspect of dreams, such as methodology for dream interpretation or comparative study of dream theories.           Clinical Seminar on Dreams  Instructor: Mark Blechner    Current Perspectives on Dreaming: Theory, Research and Practice  Instructor: James Fosshage   COMPARATIVE PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4584)    Contemporary psychoanalysis is diverse and pluralistic, some might even say fragmented into various schools and theories. This course examines psychoanalytic theories and clinical practices using a model of \u201ccomparative psychoanalysis.\u201d Theories and practices are examined historically, compared along the lines of theoretical and clinical issues, and compared for their implications in the treatment situation. Readings and course discussions add complexity and depth to the student\u2019s sense of the contributions and limitations of each model for clinical practice.

From this point of view, psychoanalysis itself can be critiqued as constructing and constraining such discourses. In addition, psychoanalysis is viewed as part of the larger mental health system, with all its social welfare and social control functions. But psychoanalysis can also function in service of social critique, as when it offers understandings of socio-economic-political structures that are concealed in the surface of ordinary discourses. These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.

Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.

Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.

Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.
