My first book, on the French aircraft industry, examined the internal dynamics of a politically turbulent industry from the Great Depression through the early Cold War. I am now finishing a book on the social and economic reconstruction of France after the Second World War with a focus on why government elites and a variety of social groups came to regard state authority in new ways during what I call the \u201clong Liberation\u201d from 1944 to 1962. This project makes comparisons across several areas of public policy--industrial renewal, family policy, immigration, taxation, and the regulation of the retail trade--where state intervention took controversial new forms. I also have an abiding interest in comparative history and work that examines France in a broader European, colonial, and trans-Atlantic context. In this spirit I have written on steel towns in the U.S. and Europe, have co-authored a textbook stressing inter-regional comparisons in Europe, and have co-edited books on democratization across the globe, on labor relations, and on \u201cRace in France\u201d as understood through French-American comparisons. My current research interests include issues of race and ethnicity, cultures of work, postwar state planning, and center-periphery dynamics in twentieth-century France. I also serve as the editor of the journal French Politics, Culture & Society, which is jointly sponsored by NYU's Institute of French Studies and Harvard University's Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies.
