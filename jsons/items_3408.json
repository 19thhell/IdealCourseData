I will give a Keynote Address: \u201cDewesternizing Production   Studies: Lessons from Bollywood\u201d at the international conference -   \u201cFeaturing Africa: Exploring the Plurality of African Digital Film   Cultures\u201d \u2014 organized by the Laboratoire d\u2019Anthropologie Sociale et   Culturelle at the University of Liege, Belgium, on October 3, 2014 . Ongoing Research  Film Schools and Film Training in India I began in early 2013 what I anticipate will be a long-term, multi-sited fieldwork project about the development of film schools and film training in India. My initial impetus for this project emerged from my previous fieldwork about the Hindi film industry where I traced its growing processes of formalization and professionalization. My ethnographic focus thus far has been a film school, Whistling Woods International, conceptualized and developed by one of the prominent producer-directors of the Bombay industry, specifically to train personnel to feed into the mainstream film industry. During four research trips to Bombay in 2013 and 2014 where I have met faculty, students, administrators, as well as attended classes on screenwriting, directing, and editing, I am trying to understand what is involved in the process of formalizing knowledge that was previously very tacit, informal, and experiential and transplanting it from a film set into a classroom. I envision expanding the focus to include other film schools in India as well as the numerous short-term for profit film training workshops offered by varied film practitioners throughout Bombay. Language Ideologies in the Hindi Film Industry Emerging from my film school fieldwork, observations of contemporary Hindi cinema, as well as my long-term fieldwork about the production cultures of the Hindi film industry, this project examines the relationship between Hindi and English in the Bombay film industry. There are two broad dimensions that I am exploring: the state and status of Hindi linguistic skill within the Hindi film industry; and practices of translation between Hindi and English. I\u2019ve been meeting and interacting with an array of film industry personnel in Bombay who deal centrally with the aforementioned dimensions \u2013 from screenwriters to dialect coaches to subtitling and dubbing professionals. With the increasing opportunities and attractions afforded by the Hindi film industry and the growing international profile of \u201cBollywood,\u201d I am investigating how language and linguistic competence become sites for the elaboration of distinction, the performance of cultural capital, and the enactment of new hierarchies within the Hindi film industry. Indian Cinema in the United States I received a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipend Fellowship for 2013 to start my research about the social life of Indian cinema in the U.S., which dates back to 1928. This project examines how films, filmmakers, and filmmaking have been implicated in the political, economic, and cultural relations between India and the United States. The larger goal is to produce a social history of Indian filmmaking that broadens and complicates our understanding of the relationship between India and the U.S. and reframes the study of both Indian and Hollywood cinemas. During the summer of 2013, through archival research at the New York Public Library and other sites, I began to unearth the history of the early circulation of Indian films and filmmakers in the U.S, specifically in New York City, but of course there is much more research to be done across a number of archives.  Publications I was asked to be on the editorial board of a new multi-media and open access online journal entitled Media Industries for which I was asked to contribute a short essay for its inaugural issue. My reflection, \u201cThe Value of Ethnography\u201d (v.1 no.1) argues that an ethnographic approach to media industries can help us to accomplish three important goals: to diversify the study of media ndustries; to take into account contestations over status and other forms of cultural and symbolic capital that characterize the field of media production; and to be able to critically examine discourses and quantitative data generated by media industries. My review essay, \u201cNeoliberalism\u201d for the Annual Review of Anthropology has been published in volume 43 of the journal. It examines current anthropological engagements with neoliberalism and explains why the concept has been so attractive for anthropologists since the millennium. For anthropologists, neoliberalism frequently functions as an index of the global political-economic order and allows for a vast array of ethnographic sites and topics to be contained within the same frame. However, I discuss how neoliberalism as an analytical framework can also obscure ethnographic particularities and foreclose certain avenues of inquiry. I finished revising an article, \u201cThe Necessity of Chance: Negotiating Ambiguity and Uncertainty in Commercial Hindi Cinema Production,\u201d which is under review for a special section about speculation and new economic imaginaries in India in the journal Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. This article grew out of a presentation that I made at a seminar, \u201cSpeculation in India: Seminar on Imaginaries of Indian Economies\u201d organized by the Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies at the University of Copenhagen in March 2013. In my presentation and subsequent article, I argue that unlike other spheres of contemporary life, which are marked by the dominance of enumerative logics as part of the modern regimes of discipline, governance, and control, mainstream film production is significantly characterized by speculative logics. In large-scale culture industries like \u201cBollywood\u201d or even Hollywood, I contend that the presence of ambiguity, chance, and uncertainty are necessary and actually critical for the long-term existence of such industries. My article, \u201cThinking in English, Speaking in Hindi: The Linguistic Division of Labor in the Hindi Film Industry,\u201d is in press for an edited volume provisionally titled Precarious Creativity: Global Media, Local Labor to be published by University of California Press. The volume grows out of an international conference of the same name held at UC-Santa Barbara, which brought scholars of media industries together to discuss a variety of issues having to do with creative labor. In my essay I focus on what seems to be a curious paradox \u2013 the spoken language in contemporary Hindi films appears much more diverse and regionally specific than films from earlier decades, at the same time that English has become the virtual lingua franca of production among the elite categories of creative workers [writers, directors, actors, production designers] within the film industry. I argue that changes in language or code choice within Hindi cinema animate very concretely the transformations in the political economy of the Hindi film industry that have taken place since the advent of economic liberalization, thus demonstrating how language plays a critical role in the political economy of a media industry.

I will give a Keynote Address: \u201cDewesternizing Production   Studies: Lessons from Bollywood\u201d at the international conference -   \u201cFeaturing Africa: Exploring the Plurality of African Digital Film   Cultures\u201d \u2014 organized by the Laboratoire d\u2019Anthropologie Sociale et   Culturelle at the University of Liege, Belgium, on October 3, 2014 . Ongoing Research  Film Schools and Film Training in India I began in early 2013 what I anticipate will be a long-term, multi-sited fieldwork project about the development of film schools and film training in India. My initial impetus for this project emerged from my previous fieldwork about the Hindi film industry where I traced its growing processes of formalization and professionalization. My ethnographic focus thus far has been a film school, Whistling Woods International, conceptualized and developed by one of the prominent producer-directors of the Bombay industry, specifically to train personnel to feed into the mainstream film industry. During four research trips to Bombay in 2013 and 2014 where I have met faculty, students, administrators, as well as attended classes on screenwriting, directing, and editing, I am trying to understand what is involved in the process of formalizing knowledge that was previously very tacit, informal, and experiential and transplanting it from a film set into a classroom. I envision expanding the focus to include other film schools in India as well as the numerous short-term for profit film training workshops offered by varied film practitioners throughout Bombay. Language Ideologies in the Hindi Film Industry Emerging from my film school fieldwork, observations of contemporary Hindi cinema, as well as my long-term fieldwork about the production cultures of the Hindi film industry, this project examines the relationship between Hindi and English in the Bombay film industry. There are two broad dimensions that I am exploring: the state and status of Hindi linguistic skill within the Hindi film industry; and practices of translation between Hindi and English. I\u2019ve been meeting and interacting with an array of film industry personnel in Bombay who deal centrally with the aforementioned dimensions \u2013 from screenwriters to dialect coaches to subtitling and dubbing professionals. With the increasing opportunities and attractions afforded by the Hindi film industry and the growing international profile of \u201cBollywood,\u201d I am investigating how language and linguistic competence become sites for the elaboration of distinction, the performance of cultural capital, and the enactment of new hierarchies within the Hindi film industry. Indian Cinema in the United States I received a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipend Fellowship for 2013 to start my research about the social life of Indian cinema in the U.S., which dates back to 1928. This project examines how films, filmmakers, and filmmaking have been implicated in the political, economic, and cultural relations between India and the United States. The larger goal is to produce a social history of Indian filmmaking that broadens and complicates our understanding of the relationship between India and the U.S. and reframes the study of both Indian and Hollywood cinemas. During the summer of 2013, through archival research at the New York Public Library and other sites, I began to unearth the history of the early circulation of Indian films and filmmakers in the U.S, specifically in New York City, but of course there is much more research to be done across a number of archives.  Publications I was asked to be on the editorial board of a new multi-media and open access online journal entitled Media Industries for which I was asked to contribute a short essay for its inaugural issue. My reflection, \u201cThe Value of Ethnography\u201d (v.1 no.1) argues that an ethnographic approach to media industries can help us to accomplish three important goals: to diversify the study of media ndustries; to take into account contestations over status and other forms of cultural and symbolic capital that characterize the field of media production; and to be able to critically examine discourses and quantitative data generated by media industries. My review essay, \u201cNeoliberalism\u201d for the Annual Review of Anthropology has been published in volume 43 of the journal. It examines current anthropological engagements with neoliberalism and explains why the concept has been so attractive for anthropologists since the millennium. For anthropologists, neoliberalism frequently functions as an index of the global political-economic order and allows for a vast array of ethnographic sites and topics to be contained within the same frame. However, I discuss how neoliberalism as an analytical framework can also obscure ethnographic particularities and foreclose certain avenues of inquiry. I finished revising an article, \u201cThe Necessity of Chance: Negotiating Ambiguity and Uncertainty in Commercial Hindi Cinema Production,\u201d which is under review for a special section about speculation and new economic imaginaries in India in the journal Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. This article grew out of a presentation that I made at a seminar, \u201cSpeculation in India: Seminar on Imaginaries of Indian Economies\u201d organized by the Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies at the University of Copenhagen in March 2013. In my presentation and subsequent article, I argue that unlike other spheres of contemporary life, which are marked by the dominance of enumerative logics as part of the modern regimes of discipline, governance, and control, mainstream film production is significantly characterized by speculative logics. In large-scale culture industries like \u201cBollywood\u201d or even Hollywood, I contend that the presence of ambiguity, chance, and uncertainty are necessary and actually critical for the long-term existence of such industries. My article, \u201cThinking in English, Speaking in Hindi: The Linguistic Division of Labor in the Hindi Film Industry,\u201d is in press for an edited volume provisionally titled Precarious Creativity: Global Media, Local Labor to be published by University of California Press. The volume grows out of an international conference of the same name held at UC-Santa Barbara, which brought scholars of media industries together to discuss a variety of issues having to do with creative labor. In my essay I focus on what seems to be a curious paradox \u2013 the spoken language in contemporary Hindi films appears much more diverse and regionally specific than films from earlier decades, at the same time that English has become the virtual lingua franca of production among the elite categories of creative workers [writers, directors, actors, production designers] within the film industry. I argue that changes in language or code choice within Hindi cinema animate very concretely the transformations in the political economy of the Hindi film industry that have taken place since the advent of economic liberalization, thus demonstrating how language plays a critical role in the political economy of a media industry.

NYU\u2019s Study Abroad programs offer students the chance to combine total-emersion experience of everyday life in an unfamiliar setting with formal classroom learning about it. What better way to explore anthropological understandings of the world around us? Or to get a firmer grasp on the lifeways of a new place?  Paris   Buenos Aires   Madrid   Prague  WHAT CAN I EXPECT? All anthropology courses offered at NYU Study Abroad sites are taught by professional anthropologists and focus on aspects of the host society and culture. All aim to draw from\u2014and sharpen\u2014students\u2019 own experience and observations in the study-abroad setting. These courses count toward the anthropology major and minor, but are also designed to be accessible and appealing to non-majors.

But they are just as strongly encouraged to complement this work with courses offering other approaches to their study abroad setting: its language, history, literature, politics, art, etc. Students should seriously take account of these offerings in cognate fields when making their study abroad choices. When Should I Go? There is no general rule about the best semester for anthropology majors to study abroad, but individual circumstances--aiming to participate in the Honors Program in Anthropology, for example--may affect optimal timing. Students are encouraged to consult with the Anthropology Department Director of Undergraduate Studies early in their planning.  Biological Anthropology and Archaeology At present, no courses in these subfields are offered at NYU study abroad sites. Students specializing in biological anthropology have often taken advantage of the general science offerings at NYU in London (especially during sophomore year) to advance in their major. Students most interested in archaeology have generally found it useful to enroll in summer field schools outside of NYU offerings. They are strongly advised to consult well in advance with their archaeology professors and the Anthropology Department Director of Undergraduate Studies for advice on recommended programs, course credits, and funding possibilities.  Applying to Study Abroad To learn more about Study Abroad, students are encouraged to attend one of  NYU Global Programs' weekly information sessions held every Friday during the  school year. To register, please complete the RSVP form at Access NYU's Global  Network: NYU Global Programs Info Sessions . To enroll in any of the courses offered abroad, students must first apply   to the relevant Study Abroad program through the Office of Global Programs.  Course offerings are subject to change.    Consult NYU Study Abroad Site webpages for detailed information for  all courses offered in particular semesters.    For updates on anthropology offerings, consult  the Anthropology Department Global Coordinator [ scr1@nyu.edu ]. For more information on registering for Study Abroad courses consult the NYU Study Abroad Program   Website  Study Abroad Scholarships Global Pathways Scholarship Program (GPS) All admitted Study Away undergraduate students who will receive a degree from NYU in New York applying for financial aid will be automatically evaluated for an additional need-based award: the GPS is up to $4,000 per semester (depending on demonstrated need) to cover the additional costs of studying away. Students will receive an award notification beginning in June (for fall semester) and in November (for spring semester). Students follow the regular Office of Financial Aid process for applying for need based aid. Global Programs Merit Scholarships A small group of students that have been admitted for a   semester study at one of the NYU Academic Centers will be awarded a   merit grant of $1,500. Awards will be determined based on the quality   of the student\u2019s application and academic record. Selected students will   be informed shortly after notification. All funding is posted as tuition credit to the recipient\u2019s NYU student account. No separate application is   required.
