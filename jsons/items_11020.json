Arriving  Walking Directions In terms of getting to the session location--the convenient thing is that all of the AME sessions are being held at the NYU: Kimmel Center for University Life , located on Washington Square South between LaGuardia and Thompson Streets. The building number is 60, though you can&#39;t miss it--it&#39;s ten floors high, and a mix of tan brick and glass. The closest subway connection is the A/C/E (the Blue line), which stops at West Fourth Street and Sixth Avenue. When you reach West Fourth, you come up the station stairs to the street and walk straight ahead to the end of the block (You are walking north/uptown,with Sixth Avenue on your left side.) On the corner you have reached West Fourth Street; turn right and keep going straight. You will cross MacDougall Street where Washington Square Park begins, and West Fourth Street becomes Washington Square South. You will cross Sullivan Street, then Thompson street, and pass the church on your right, which is next to the Kimmel Center. Enter the building, and by the time you need to do this, we will have let everyone know of the exact room locations of each session. For additional travel information please see: AME: Getting Here   Preparing for Your Session  Poster Presentations Poster boards and thumbtacks will be provided. Poster board size is 20 x 30 inches. Roundtable Presentation **Note Roundtable will begin at 4:30-5:45 on Thursday!

Arriving  Walking Directions In terms of getting to the session location--the convenient thing is that all of the AME sessions are being held at the NYU: Kimmel Center for University Life , located on Washington Square South between LaGuardia and Thompson Streets. The building number is 60, though you can&#39;t miss it--it&#39;s ten floors high, and a mix of tan brick and glass. The closest subway connection is the A/C/E (the Blue line), which stops at West Fourth Street and Sixth Avenue. When you reach West Fourth, you come up the station stairs to the street and walk straight ahead to the end of the block (You are walking north/uptown,with Sixth Avenue on your left side.) On the corner you have reached West Fourth Street; turn right and keep going straight. You will cross MacDougall Street where Washington Square Park begins, and West Fourth Street becomes Washington Square South. You will cross Sullivan Street, then Thompson street, and pass the church on your right, which is next to the Kimmel Center. Enter the building, and by the time you need to do this, we will have let everyone know of the exact room locations of each session. For additional travel information please see: AME: Getting Here   Preparing for Your Session  Poster Presentations Poster boards and thumbtacks will be provided. Poster board size is 20 x 30 inches. Roundtable Presentation **Note Roundtable will begin at 4:30-5:45 on Thursday!
