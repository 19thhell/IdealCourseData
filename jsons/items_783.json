Currently, Shapshay is working on a book provisionally titled Degrees of Inherent Value: Schopenhauer\u2019s Ethical Thought that reconstructs Schopenhauer\u2019s ethics of compassion and argues that it offers a hybrid Kantian-Moral Sense theory of ethics that promises to interject a novel, less-anthropocentric option into the ethical-theoretical landscape.
