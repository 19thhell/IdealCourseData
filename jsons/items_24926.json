The algorithm was developed with the advice of a panel of ED and primary care physicians, and it is based on an examination of a sample of almost 6,000 full ED records. Data abstracted from these records included the initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, age, gender, diagnoses, procedures performed, and resources used in the ED. Based on this information, each case was classified into one of the following categories:   Non-emergent - The patient's initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, and age indicated that immediate medical care was not required within 12 hours;   Emergent/Primary Care Treatable - Based on information in the record, treatment was required within 12 hours, but care could have been provided effectively and safely in a primary care setting. The complaint did not require continuous observation, and no procedures were performed or resources used that are not available in a primary care setting (e.g., CAT scan or certain lab tests);   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required based on the complaint or procedures performed/resources used, but the emergent nature of the condition was potentially preventable/avoidable if timely and effective ambulatory care had been received during the episode of illness (e.g., the flare-ups of asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure, etc.); and   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Not Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required and ambulatory care treatment could not have prevented the condition (e.g., trauma, appendicitis, myocardial infarction, etc.).   This information that was used to develop the algorithm required analysis of the full medical record. Since such detailed information is not generally available on computerized ED or claims records, these classifications were then \"mapped\" to the discharge diagnosis of each case in our sample to determine for each diagnosis the percentage of sample cases that fell into these four categories. For example, patients discharged with a final diagnosis of \"abdominal pain\" may include both patients who arrived at the ED complaining of stomach pain, as well as those who reported chest pain (an a possible heart attack). Accordingly, for abdominal pain, the algorithm assigns a specific percentage of the visit into the categories of \"non-emergent\", \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and \"emergent/ED care needed-not preventable/avoidable\" based on what we observed in our sample for cases with an ultimate discharge diagnosis of abdominal pain.   It is important to recognize that the algorithm is not intended as a triage tool or a mechanism to determine whether ED use in a specific case is \"appropriate\" (e.g., for reimbursement purposes). Since few diagnostic categories are clear-cut in all cases, the algorithm assigns cases probabilistically on a percentage basis, reflecting this potential uncertainty and variation.   Since the original development of the algorithm, users have expressed an interest in examining separately cases involving a primary diagnosis of injury, mental health problems, alcohol, or substance abuse. Accordingly, we have pulled these conditions out of the standard classification scheme, and tabulate them separately. There are also a residual of conditions (approximately 15%) where our sample was not of sufficient size to assign percentages for the standard classification - these conditions are also tabulated separately. See Attachment for schematic diagram of algorithm.   Applying the Algorithm to an ED Data Base   We have developed software for applying the algorithm using three different software applications: SAS, SPSS, and ACCESS. Detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm are included in Download section of this website. All three applications produce an output data set that adds a new set of variables to your original data set - the names of the new variables are:   ne = \"Non-emergent\"   \u00a0   epct = \"Emergent/Primary Care Treatable\"   \u00a0   edcnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   edcnnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Not Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   injury = \"Injury principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   psych = \"Mental health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   alcohol = \"Alcohol-related health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   drug = \"Drug-related health principal diagnoses (excluding alcohol)\"   \u00a0   unclassified = \"Not classified - not in one of the above categories\"   For each ED encounter, the numbers in the new fields represent the relative percentage of cases for that diagnosis falling into the various classification categories. For example, in the case of urinary tract infections (ICD-9-CM code 599.0), each case is assigned 66% \"non-emergent\", 17% \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and 17% \"emergent - ED care needed - preventable/avoidable\". The sum of the data new data fields will always total 1\", and the injury, psych, alcohol, drug, and unclassified fields are always binary (equal to 1\" or 0\").   In addition, the ACCESS program produce output files in EXCEL format that profiles ED use by hospital, payor group, zip code area, and by patient race/ethnicity. For SAS and SPSS applications, this output can be obtained by simply aggregated these values to find the total percentage of cases by hospital, payor group, zip code, race/ethnicity, etc.                                                                                      \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}]},

Notify us in case of errors or questions about your bill. If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write to us on a separate sheet of paper (not on your billing statement) at:          New York University     Office of the Bursar     105 East 17th street, 3rd Floor      New York, NY 10003        Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following information:          Your name and University ID number      The dollar amount of the suspected error      Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.               Your Rights and Our Responsibilities     After We Receive Your Written Notice      We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days of its receipt by us, unless we have corrected the error by then (within two billing cycles and no more than 90 days). We must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill is correct.      After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill for the amount in question including finance charges. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question.      If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.      If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. In the event that our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. We must also tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We are obligated to tell anyone we reported you to that the matter has been resolved once everything is finally settled.      If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50.00 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.      Your Account at New York University is subject to the following Conditions and Terms:          A Finance Charge will be imposed on unpaid student accounts, from the first day of classes, until the outstanding balance is paid in full. The amount of the Finance Charge is determined by applying a periodic rate of one percent (1%) per month to the &quot;average daily balance&quot; of your account. The corresponding annual percentage rate is twelve percent (12%).      To get the &quot;average daily balance,&quot; we take the beginning balance of your account (which includes any unpaid tuition and fees) each day, we add any new charges to your account, and subtract any payments or credits made to your account. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle.

The algorithm was developed with the advice of a panel of ED and primary care physicians, and it is based on an examination of a sample of almost 6,000 full ED records. Data abstracted from these records included the initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, age, gender, diagnoses, procedures performed, and resources used in the ED. Based on this information, each case was classified into one of the following categories:   Non-emergent - The patient's initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, and age indicated that immediate medical care was not required within 12 hours;   Emergent/Primary Care Treatable - Based on information in the record, treatment was required within 12 hours, but care could have been provided effectively and safely in a primary care setting. The complaint did not require continuous observation, and no procedures were performed or resources used that are not available in a primary care setting (e.g., CAT scan or certain lab tests);   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required based on the complaint or procedures performed/resources used, but the emergent nature of the condition was potentially preventable/avoidable if timely and effective ambulatory care had been received during the episode of illness (e.g., the flare-ups of asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure, etc.); and   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Not Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required and ambulatory care treatment could not have prevented the condition (e.g., trauma, appendicitis, myocardial infarction, etc.).   This information that was used to develop the algorithm required analysis of the full medical record. Since such detailed information is not generally available on computerized ED or claims records, these classifications were then \"mapped\" to the discharge diagnosis of each case in our sample to determine for each diagnosis the percentage of sample cases that fell into these four categories. For example, patients discharged with a final diagnosis of \"abdominal pain\" may include both patients who arrived at the ED complaining of stomach pain, as well as those who reported chest pain (an a possible heart attack). Accordingly, for abdominal pain, the algorithm assigns a specific percentage of the visit into the categories of \"non-emergent\", \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and \"emergent/ED care needed-not preventable/avoidable\" based on what we observed in our sample for cases with an ultimate discharge diagnosis of abdominal pain.   It is important to recognize that the algorithm is not intended as a triage tool or a mechanism to determine whether ED use in a specific case is \"appropriate\" (e.g., for reimbursement purposes). Since few diagnostic categories are clear-cut in all cases, the algorithm assigns cases probabilistically on a percentage basis, reflecting this potential uncertainty and variation.   Since the original development of the algorithm, users have expressed an interest in examining separately cases involving a primary diagnosis of injury, mental health problems, alcohol, or substance abuse. Accordingly, we have pulled these conditions out of the standard classification scheme, and tabulate them separately. There are also a residual of conditions (approximately 15%) where our sample was not of sufficient size to assign percentages for the standard classification - these conditions are also tabulated separately. See Attachment for schematic diagram of algorithm.   Applying the Algorithm to an ED Data Base   We have developed software for applying the algorithm using three different software applications: SAS, SPSS, and ACCESS. Detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm are included in Download section of this website. All three applications produce an output data set that adds a new set of variables to your original data set - the names of the new variables are:   ne = \"Non-emergent\"   \u00a0   epct = \"Emergent/Primary Care Treatable\"   \u00a0   edcnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   edcnnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Not Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   injury = \"Injury principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   psych = \"Mental health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   alcohol = \"Alcohol-related health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   drug = \"Drug-related health principal diagnoses (excluding alcohol)\"   \u00a0   unclassified = \"Not classified - not in one of the above categories\"   For each ED encounter, the numbers in the new fields represent the relative percentage of cases for that diagnosis falling into the various classification categories. For example, in the case of urinary tract infections (ICD-9-CM code 599.0), each case is assigned 66% \"non-emergent\", 17% \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and 17% \"emergent - ED care needed - preventable/avoidable\". The sum of the data new data fields will always total 1\", and the injury, psych, alcohol, drug, and unclassified fields are always binary (equal to 1\" or 0\").   In addition, the ACCESS program produce output files in EXCEL format that profiles ED use by hospital, payor group, zip code area, and by patient race/ethnicity. For SAS and SPSS applications, this output can be obtained by simply aggregated these values to find the total percentage of cases by hospital, payor group, zip code, race/ethnicity, etc.                                                                                      \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}, {"content": "NYU &gt;    Office of the Bursar    &gt; Your Account    &gt; Your Billing Rights                                                                                                        Skip to Navigation | Skip to Content                                                       Home | Location &amp; Hours | Contact                         Quick Links         Academic Calendars      Albert      Athletics      Bookstores      Career Development      Giving to NYU      Health Center      Housing      ITS      Job Listings      Libraries      NYU Apparel      NYU Facts      Public Affairs      Public Safety      Registrar      Student Resource Center      Wellness Exchange      NYU A-Z               Schools         Arts and Science      College of Arts and Science      College of Dentistry      College of Nursing      Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences      Gallatin School of Individualized Study      Graduate School of Arts and Science      Institute of Fine Arts      Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Leonard N.

Notify us in case of errors or questions about your bill. If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write to us on a separate sheet of paper (not on your billing statement) at:          New York University     Office of the Bursar     105 East 17th street, 3rd Floor      New York, NY 10003        Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following information:          Your name and University ID number      The dollar amount of the suspected error      Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.               Your Rights and Our Responsibilities     After We Receive Your Written Notice      We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days of its receipt by us, unless we have corrected the error by then (within two billing cycles and no more than 90 days). We must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill is correct.      After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill for the amount in question including finance charges. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question.      If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.      If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. In the event that our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. We must also tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We are obligated to tell anyone we reported you to that the matter has been resolved once everything is finally settled.      If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50.00 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.      Your Account at New York University is subject to the following Conditions and Terms:          A Finance Charge will be imposed on unpaid student accounts, from the first day of classes, until the outstanding balance is paid in full. The amount of the Finance Charge is determined by applying a periodic rate of one percent (1%) per month to the &quot;average daily balance&quot; of your account. The corresponding annual percentage rate is twelve percent (12%).      To get the &quot;average daily balance,&quot; we take the beginning balance of your account (which includes any unpaid tuition and fees) each day, we add any new charges to your account, and subtract any payments or credits made to your account. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the &quot;average daily balance.&quot;      If the University refers any unpaid accounts for collection, you will be held responsible for all associated charges including attorney's fees of up to one-third of the balance to the full extent permitted by law.      The University reserves the right to withhold registration material and all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for interest, housing, dining or other activities) or for as long as any arrears remain."}, {"content": "NYU &gt;    Office of the Bursar    &gt; Your Account    &gt; Billing Schedule                                                                                                        Skip to Navigation | Skip to Content                                                       Home | Location &amp; Hours | Contact                         Quick Links         Academic Calendars      Albert      Athletics      Bookstores      Career Development      Giving to NYU      Health Center      Housing      ITS      Job Listings      Libraries      NYU Apparel      NYU Facts      Public Affairs      Public Safety      Registrar      Student Resource Center      Wellness Exchange      NYU A-Z               Schools         Arts and Science      College of Arts and Science      College of Dentistry      College of Nursing      Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences      Gallatin School of Individualized Study      Graduate School of Arts and Science      Institute of Fine Arts      Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Leonard N.

The algorithm was developed with the advice of a panel of ED and primary care physicians, and it is based on an examination of a sample of almost 6,000 full ED records. Data abstracted from these records included the initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, age, gender, diagnoses, procedures performed, and resources used in the ED. Based on this information, each case was classified into one of the following categories:   Non-emergent - The patient's initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, and age indicated that immediate medical care was not required within 12 hours;   Emergent/Primary Care Treatable - Based on information in the record, treatment was required within 12 hours, but care could have been provided effectively and safely in a primary care setting. The complaint did not require continuous observation, and no procedures were performed or resources used that are not available in a primary care setting (e.g., CAT scan or certain lab tests);   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required based on the complaint or procedures performed/resources used, but the emergent nature of the condition was potentially preventable/avoidable if timely and effective ambulatory care had been received during the episode of illness (e.g., the flare-ups of asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure, etc.); and   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Not Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required and ambulatory care treatment could not have prevented the condition (e.g., trauma, appendicitis, myocardial infarction, etc.).   This information that was used to develop the algorithm required analysis of the full medical record. Since such detailed information is not generally available on computerized ED or claims records, these classifications were then \"mapped\" to the discharge diagnosis of each case in our sample to determine for each diagnosis the percentage of sample cases that fell into these four categories. For example, patients discharged with a final diagnosis of \"abdominal pain\" may include both patients who arrived at the ED complaining of stomach pain, as well as those who reported chest pain (an a possible heart attack). Accordingly, for abdominal pain, the algorithm assigns a specific percentage of the visit into the categories of \"non-emergent\", \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and \"emergent/ED care needed-not preventable/avoidable\" based on what we observed in our sample for cases with an ultimate discharge diagnosis of abdominal pain.   It is important to recognize that the algorithm is not intended as a triage tool or a mechanism to determine whether ED use in a specific case is \"appropriate\" (e.g., for reimbursement purposes). Since few diagnostic categories are clear-cut in all cases, the algorithm assigns cases probabilistically on a percentage basis, reflecting this potential uncertainty and variation.   Since the original development of the algorithm, users have expressed an interest in examining separately cases involving a primary diagnosis of injury, mental health problems, alcohol, or substance abuse. Accordingly, we have pulled these conditions out of the standard classification scheme, and tabulate them separately. There are also a residual of conditions (approximately 15%) where our sample was not of sufficient size to assign percentages for the standard classification - these conditions are also tabulated separately. See Attachment for schematic diagram of algorithm.   Applying the Algorithm to an ED Data Base   We have developed software for applying the algorithm using three different software applications: SAS, SPSS, and ACCESS. Detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm are included in Download section of this website. All three applications produce an output data set that adds a new set of variables to your original data set - the names of the new variables are:   ne = \"Non-emergent\"   \u00a0   epct = \"Emergent/Primary Care Treatable\"   \u00a0   edcnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   edcnnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Not Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   injury = \"Injury principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   psych = \"Mental health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   alcohol = \"Alcohol-related health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   drug = \"Drug-related health principal diagnoses (excluding alcohol)\"   \u00a0   unclassified = \"Not classified - not in one of the above categories\"   For each ED encounter, the numbers in the new fields represent the relative percentage of cases for that diagnosis falling into the various classification categories. For example, in the case of urinary tract infections (ICD-9-CM code 599.0), each case is assigned 66% \"non-emergent\", 17% \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and 17% \"emergent - ED care needed - preventable/avoidable\". The sum of the data new data fields will always total 1\", and the injury, psych, alcohol, drug, and unclassified fields are always binary (equal to 1\" or 0\").   In addition, the ACCESS program produce output files in EXCEL format that profiles ED use by hospital, payor group, zip code area, and by patient race/ethnicity. For SAS and SPSS applications, this output can be obtained by simply aggregated these values to find the total percentage of cases by hospital, payor group, zip code, race/ethnicity, etc.                                                                                      \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}]},

In your letter, give us the following information:          Your name and University ID number      The dollar amount of the suspected error      Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.               Your Rights and Our Responsibilities     After We Receive Your Written Notice      We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days of its receipt by us, unless we have corrected the error by then (within two billing cycles and no more than 90 days). We must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill is correct.      After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill for the amount in question including finance charges. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question.      If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.      If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. In the event that our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. We must also tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We are obligated to tell anyone we reported you to that the matter has been resolved once everything is finally settled.      If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50.00 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.      Your Account at New York University is subject to the following Conditions and Terms:          A Finance Charge will be imposed on unpaid student accounts, from the first day of classes, until the outstanding balance is paid in full. The amount of the Finance Charge is determined by applying a periodic rate of one percent (1%) per month to the &quot;average daily balance&quot; of your account. The corresponding annual percentage rate is twelve percent (12%).      To get the &quot;average daily balance,&quot; we take the beginning balance of your account (which includes any unpaid tuition and fees) each day, we add any new charges to your account, and subtract any payments or credits made to your account. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the &quot;average daily balance.&quot;      If the University refers any unpaid accounts for collection, you will be held responsible for all associated charges including attorney's fees of up to one-third of the balance to the full extent permitted by law.      The University reserves the right to withhold registration material and all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for interest, housing, dining or other activities) or for as long as any arrears remain."}]},

The algorithm was developed with the advice of a panel of ED and primary care physicians, and it is based on an examination of a sample of almost 6,000 full ED records. Data abstracted from these records included the initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, age, gender, diagnoses, procedures performed, and resources used in the ED. Based on this information, each case was classified into one of the following categories:   Non-emergent - The patient's initial complaint, presenting symptoms, vital signs, medical history, and age indicated that immediate medical care was not required within 12 hours;   Emergent/Primary Care Treatable - Based on information in the record, treatment was required within 12 hours, but care could have been provided effectively and safely in a primary care setting. The complaint did not require continuous observation, and no procedures were performed or resources used that are not available in a primary care setting (e.g., CAT scan or certain lab tests);   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required based on the complaint or procedures performed/resources used, but the emergent nature of the condition was potentially preventable/avoidable if timely and effective ambulatory care had been received during the episode of illness (e.g., the flare-ups of asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure, etc.); and   Emergent - ED Care Needed - Not Preventable/Avoidable - Emergency department care was required and ambulatory care treatment could not have prevented the condition (e.g., trauma, appendicitis, myocardial infarction, etc.).   This information that was used to develop the algorithm required analysis of the full medical record. Since such detailed information is not generally available on computerized ED or claims records, these classifications were then \"mapped\" to the discharge diagnosis of each case in our sample to determine for each diagnosis the percentage of sample cases that fell into these four categories. For example, patients discharged with a final diagnosis of \"abdominal pain\" may include both patients who arrived at the ED complaining of stomach pain, as well as those who reported chest pain (an a possible heart attack). Accordingly, for abdominal pain, the algorithm assigns a specific percentage of the visit into the categories of \"non-emergent\", \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and \"emergent/ED care needed-not preventable/avoidable\" based on what we observed in our sample for cases with an ultimate discharge diagnosis of abdominal pain.   It is important to recognize that the algorithm is not intended as a triage tool or a mechanism to determine whether ED use in a specific case is \"appropriate\" (e.g., for reimbursement purposes). Since few diagnostic categories are clear-cut in all cases, the algorithm assigns cases probabilistically on a percentage basis, reflecting this potential uncertainty and variation.   Since the original development of the algorithm, users have expressed an interest in examining separately cases involving a primary diagnosis of injury, mental health problems, alcohol, or substance abuse. Accordingly, we have pulled these conditions out of the standard classification scheme, and tabulate them separately. There are also a residual of conditions (approximately 15%) where our sample was not of sufficient size to assign percentages for the standard classification - these conditions are also tabulated separately. See Attachment for schematic diagram of algorithm.   Applying the Algorithm to an ED Data Base   We have developed software for applying the algorithm using three different software applications: SAS, SPSS, and ACCESS. Detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm are included in Download section of this website. All three applications produce an output data set that adds a new set of variables to your original data set - the names of the new variables are:   ne = \"Non-emergent\"   \u00a0   epct = \"Emergent/Primary Care Treatable\"   \u00a0   edcnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   edcnnpa = \"Emergent ? ED Care Needed ? Not Preventable/Avoidable\"   \u00a0   injury = \"Injury principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   psych = \"Mental health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   alcohol = \"Alcohol-related health principal diagnoses\"   \u00a0   drug = \"Drug-related health principal diagnoses (excluding alcohol)\"   \u00a0   unclassified = \"Not classified - not in one of the above categories\"   For each ED encounter, the numbers in the new fields represent the relative percentage of cases for that diagnosis falling into the various classification categories. For example, in the case of urinary tract infections (ICD-9-CM code 599.0), each case is assigned 66% \"non-emergent\", 17% \"emergent/primary care treatable\", and 17% \"emergent - ED care needed - preventable/avoidable\". The sum of the data new data fields will always total 1\", and the injury, psych, alcohol, drug, and unclassified fields are always binary (equal to 1\" or 0\").   In addition, the ACCESS program produce output files in EXCEL format that profiles ED use by hospital, payor group, zip code area, and by patient race/ethnicity. For SAS and SPSS applications, this output can be obtained by simply aggregated these values to find the total percentage of cases by hospital, payor group, zip code, race/ethnicity, etc.                                                                                      \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}, {"content": "NYU &gt;    Office of the Bursar    &gt; Your Account    &gt; Your Billing Rights                                                                                                        Skip to Navigation | Skip to Content                                                       Home | Location &amp; Hours | Contact                         Quick Links         Academic Calendars      Albert      Athletics      Bookstores      Career Development      Giving to NYU      Health Center      Housing      ITS      Job Listings      Libraries      NYU Apparel      NYU Facts      Public Affairs      Public Safety      Registrar      Student Resource Center      Wellness Exchange      NYU A-Z               Schools         Arts and Science      College of Arts and Science      College of Dentistry      College of Nursing      Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences      Gallatin School of Individualized Study      Graduate School of Arts and Science      Institute of Fine Arts      Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Leonard N.
