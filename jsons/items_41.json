Currently, Shapshay is working on a book provisionally titled Degrees of Inherent Value: Schopenhauer\u2019s Ethical Thought that reconstructs Schopenhauer\u2019s ethics of compassion and argues that it offers a hybrid Kantian-Moral Sense theory of ethics that promises to interject a novel, less-anthropocentric option into the ethical-theoretical landscape.

Under terms of the agreement, NYU and the UAW agreed to withdraw their proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board. The University and the UAW also committed to bargain in good faith for a contract upon confirmation of a majority vote by graduate employees for UAW representation in collective bargaining.   The statement outlining the agreement is here .   In December, the graduate assistants and research assistants covered by the agreement voted to affiliate with the UAW. Negotiations for a contract are expected to commence during the spring 2014 semester.

Each conference in the series examines the development of a central philosophical problem from early modern philosophy to the present, exploring the evolution of formulations of the problem and of approaches to resolving it. By examining the work of philosophers of the past both in historical context and in relation to contemporary philosophical thinking, the conferences allow philosophy\u2019s past and present to illuminate one another.

Hide biography.      Sandra Shapshay is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Indiana University. Her interests center on 19 th century German philosophy, especially Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary aesthetics and ethics.

Levinson, ed. Suffering Art Gladly. She has also investigated Schopenhauer\u2019s theory of freedom in a paper co-authored with Alex Neill and published in the International Yearbook of German Idealism . Currently, Shapshay is working on a book provisionally titled Degrees of Inherent Value: Schopenhauer\u2019s Ethical Thought that reconstructs Schopenhauer\u2019s ethics of compassion and argues that it offers a hybrid Kantian-Moral Sense theory of ethics that promises to interject a novel, less-anthropocentric option into the ethical-theoretical landscape.
