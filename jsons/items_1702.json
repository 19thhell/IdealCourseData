Historians, literary scholars, folklorists, psychologists,  medievalists, theater scholars, and performers gather once a month at New  York University to discuss storytelling and its role in society. Professors  and students tackle issues such as the nature of oral and written  narratives and the persuasiveness of stories.   Two French professors at NYU, Evelyn \"Timmie\" Birge Vitz and Nancy  Regalado, and one of their colleagues in the history department, Martha  Hodes, organize this remarkable workshop sponsored by the NYU Humanities  Council. The group's fifth meeting will take place on February 4 and  consist of a day of graduate student roundtables. At its sixth meeting on  March 4, two panel discussions will focus on storytelling in the Middle Ages.   In December, the chosen topic was \"Storytelling in American History.\" In  the morning session, Ms. Hodes spoke on skin color and memory in the  context of family stories in the 19th century. She discussed the mutable  nature of perception of color in the present as well as the past. Ms. Hodes  is currently writing a book about a family whose racial and national  boundaries range between the British West Indies, New England, and the South.   The session also offered remarks by Rutgers law professor David Dante Troutt.   An earlier workshop explored the relation of storytelling to law and  medicine, and how stories can aid in healing and conflict resolution. A law  professor at NYU, Peggy Cooper-Davis, moderated one session in her field.  Cognitive psychologist and NYU law school professor Jerome Bruner gave the  principal address.   Mr. Bruner expressed his concerns that details that make stories powerful  are often ruled inadmissible in court. Law stories are highly ritualized,  he said, and focus on the act rather than the context of the act. Law  narratives are terse and to the point, he added.   For facts to ring true, Mr. Bruner said, they must to have narrative  coherence. Law stories told before a court of law, he said, \"are obsessed  with the peripeteia,\" or the turn of events, that has upended the ordinary  state of affairs.   Another law professor from NYU, Anthony Amsterdam, spoke next. When he  opened his talk, he joked that trying to comment on Mr. Bruner's words was  like \"trying to polish a moving Ferris wheel with a Kleenex dipped in Windex.\"   \"What makes law stories unique?\" Mr. Amsterdam asked. They are  characterized by four C's - \"constrained, combative, closed, and  compulsive.\" If all storytellers may be said to be liars, legal  storytellers are constrained liars, he said. The litigants are constrained  by facts and legal rules. If there is a knife in his client's back, the  court will look at fingerprints on the knife or will consider \"feckless  fumbling at the fingerprint lab.\" But the law limits what the court will  look at to such a small part \"so you can purport to talk knowledgeably\"  about it. Operationally, law stories respect what is called the elements of  a crime, he said.   Law stories are combative by nature, Mr. Amsterdam said. There is a winner  and a loser, and the stories are close ended: They point to a single  conclusion designed to leave no doubts. Given the high stakes at a trial,  lawyers' arguments and judicial briefs are designed to explain a result  ordained by, rather than fall prey to, \"frail, fallible human judgment.\"   Later that day, an afternoon session considered the link between medicine  and storytelling. The principal speaker was Dr. Rita Charon, director of  the program in narrative medicine and a professor of clinical medicine at  Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She said  physicians, nurses, and their colleagues had to listen for, hope to elicit,  and invite \"the story of the person who comes to us in trouble.\" An open  question such as, \"What brought you to the clinic today?\" may or may not  draw out the patient's story. The standard barrage of written questions may  not in fact be the most productive way for a doctor to spend the first hour  with the patient, Dr. Charon said. Once, while encouraging one patient to  speak up about his problems, the patient responded to Dr. Charon's  inquisitiveness with, \"You mean, you want me to talk?\"   \"When people become ill, they become storytellers,\" Dr. Charon said. She  spoke of the therapeutic potential of narrative in medicine, in particular  of attentive listening. \"The site of clinical telling,\" namely, the office  containing two people, one suffering and the other empathetically  listening, was another area she touched on. After allowing a patient to  express himself or herself, the doctor or clinician generally makes notes  on a medical chart or private journal. Dr. Charon supports, as one  approach, an alternative collaborative practice where both the patient and  the doctor together write a narrative record for future use.   The director of Columbia University's Oral History Research Office, Mary  Marshall Clark, spoke movingly about the \"September 11, 2001, Oral History  Memory and Narrative Project,\" which is gathering a wide range of accounts  of persons both directly and indirectly affected by the tragedy of  September 11. She spoke of \"entering the life story of the teller.\""}]},

{"detail": [{"content": "NY Sun article on Storytelling Workshop            January 4, 2005 Edition  Section: On the Town  NYU Workshops Address Storytelling In Law and Medicine Knickerbocker   BY GARY SHAPIRO  January 4, 2005  URL: http://www.nysun.com/article/7163  Once upon a time a group of academics analyzed storytelling - and they're  still at it. Historians, literary scholars, folklorists, psychologists,  medievalists, theater scholars, and performers gather once a month at New  York University to discuss storytelling and its role in society. Professors  and students tackle issues such as the nature of oral and written  narratives and the persuasiveness of stories.   Two French professors at NYU, Evelyn \"Timmie\" Birge Vitz and Nancy  Regalado, and one of their colleagues in the history department, Martha  Hodes, organize this remarkable workshop sponsored by the NYU Humanities  Council. The group's fifth meeting will take place on February 4 and  consist of a day of graduate student roundtables. At its sixth meeting on  March 4, two panel discussions will focus on storytelling in the Middle Ages.   In December, the chosen topic was \"Storytelling in American History.\" In  the morning session, Ms. Hodes spoke on skin color and memory in the  context of family stories in the 19th century. She discussed the mutable  nature of perception of color in the present as well as the past. Ms. Hodes  is currently writing a book about a family whose racial and national  boundaries range between the British West Indies, New England, and the South.   The session also offered remarks by Rutgers law professor David Dante Troutt.   An earlier workshop explored the relation of storytelling to law and  medicine, and how stories can aid in healing and conflict resolution. A law  professor at NYU, Peggy Cooper-Davis, moderated one session in her field.  Cognitive psychologist and NYU law school professor Jerome Bruner gave the  principal address.   Mr. Bruner expressed his concerns that details that make stories powerful  are often ruled inadmissible in court. Law stories are highly ritualized,  he said, and focus on the act rather than the context of the act. Law  narratives are terse and to the point, he added.   For facts to ring true, Mr. Bruner said, they must to have narrative  coherence. Law stories told before a court of law, he said, \"are obsessed  with the peripeteia,\" or the turn of events, that has upended the ordinary  state of affairs.   Another law professor from NYU, Anthony Amsterdam, spoke next. When he  opened his talk, he joked that trying to comment on Mr. Bruner's words was  like \"trying to polish a moving Ferris wheel with a Kleenex dipped in Windex.\"   \"What makes law stories unique?\" Mr. Amsterdam asked. They are  characterized by four C's - \"constrained, combative, closed, and  compulsive.\" If all storytellers may be said to be liars, legal  storytellers are constrained liars, he said. The litigants are constrained  by facts and legal rules. If there is a knife in his client's back, the  court will look at fingerprints on the knife or will consider \"feckless  fumbling at the fingerprint lab.\" But the law limits what the court will  look at to such a small part \"so you can purport to talk knowledgeably\"  about it. Operationally, law stories respect what is called the elements of  a crime, he said.   Law stories are combative by nature, Mr. Amsterdam said. There is a winner  and a loser, and the stories are close ended: They point to a single  conclusion designed to leave no doubts. Given the high stakes at a trial,  lawyers' arguments and judicial briefs are designed to explain a result  ordained by, rather than fall prey to, \"frail, fallible human judgment.\"   Later that day, an afternoon session considered the link between medicine  and storytelling. The principal speaker was Dr. Rita Charon, director of  the program in narrative medicine and a professor of clinical medicine at  Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She said  physicians, nurses, and their colleagues had to listen for, hope to elicit,  and invite \"the story of the person who comes to us in trouble.\" An open  question such as, \"What brought you to the clinic today?\" may or may not  draw out the patient's story. The standard barrage of written questions may  not in fact be the most productive way for a doctor to spend the first hour  with the patient, Dr. Charon said. Once, while encouraging one patient to  speak up about his problems, the patient responded to Dr. Charon's  inquisitiveness with, \"You mean, you want me to talk?\"   \"When people become ill, they become storytellers,\" Dr. Charon said. She  spoke of the therapeutic potential of narrative in medicine, in particular  of attentive listening. \"The site of clinical telling,\" namely, the office  containing two people, one suffering and the other empathetically  listening, was another area she touched on. After allowing a patient to  express himself or herself, the doctor or clinician generally makes notes  on a medical chart or private journal. Dr. Charon supports, as one  approach, an alternative collaborative practice where both the patient and  the doctor together write a narrative record for future use.   The director of Columbia University's Oral History Research Office, Mary  Marshall Clark, spoke movingly about the \"September 11, 2001, Oral History  Memory and Narrative Project,\" which is gathering a wide range of accounts  of persons both directly and indirectly affected by the tragedy of  September 11. She spoke of \"entering the life story of the teller.\""}, {"content": "Intensives                                                                                          The NYU School of Professional Studies Website    Faculty    Degrees    Professional Certificates    Upcoming Events        Search Courses     Credit Course     Non-Credit Course          Site    Noncredit Courses    Faculty                                                                                                                                 About             History & Mission The School and NYC Message from the Dean Academic Accreditation Administration Newsroom The School Community Convocation Visual Identity and Editorial Guidelines School Events                   Admissions             Graduate Admissions Undergraduate Admissions Events You@NYU Apply                   Academics             Academic Departments Academic Policies and Procedures Academic Accreditation Degree Programs Graduate Programs Undergraduate Programs Online Offerings Diploma Program Admissions  High School Academy Noncredit Offerings Course Search Certificates Intensives New Courses Online Offerings Professional Advantage Programs Information Sessions  Online Offerings                   Noncredit                 Faculty             Office of Faculty Affairs Faculty Search                   Career             About For Students For Employers For Alumni For Faculty                   Conferences & Events                 Giving                 Alumni             Alumni Community Stay Connected Alumni Benefits and Services Alumni Award Programs and Events                                                     Noncredit Intensive Programs                                            Intensives &rsaquo;                  Certificates &rsaquo;           New Courses &rsaquo;           Online Offerings &rsaquo;           Professional Advantage &rsaquo;           Programs &rsaquo;           Information Sessions &rsaquo;           Noncredit Academic Policies and Procedures &rsaquo;           Bulletin &rsaquo;           Noncredit Certificate Digital Badge &rsaquo;           Winter Session &rsaquo;                        Ready to Proceed?

The ability to understand \u201cwhat makes a good story well told\u201d is a skill that is crucial to your growth as a filmmaker whether you become a writer, director, actor, editor, cinematographer, etc. Storytelling Strategies looks at how narrative stories work through an examination of the structural and mythic elements first established by the ancient Greek playwrights and recognized by Aristotle in his \u201cPoetics\u201d thousands of years ago. The course continues this examination up to and including such contemporary story models as Joseph Campbell\u2019s \u201cThe Hero with a Thousand Faces\u201d as well as the current Hollywood paradigm, \u201cthe three-act structure.\u201d We will seek to find those principles that for the backbone of successful narrative screenplays and contribute to a film\u2019s ability to resonate with an audience. The lecture is for analysis. The recitations are for applying what you have learned to the writing of your short screenplay.
