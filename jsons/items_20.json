Description       \u00a0 Finnegans Wake \u00a0is often described as the most difficult work of literature ever written, and it is still debated whether the novel is a masterpiece or an elaborate hoax. This class will be part interdisciplinary seminar and part arts workshop. Half of the class will be devoted to the work itself. We will read short sections of the Wake in concert with various commentaries, histories, and annotations, exploring possible \u201cmeanings\u201d the text suggests. The other half of the class will engage with artistic pieces that have been inspired by or that incorporate elements of\u00a0 Finnegans Wake \u00a0, including visual art, film, music, sound art, theater, and dance. Students will study these pieces (for example John Cage\u2019s sound piece Roaratoriao and Ulick O\u2019Conner\u2019s one act play\u00a0 Joyicity \u00a0) as well as create and present their own creative works. Class requirements will include an analytical paper and a creative work. The course will also feature invited guest speakers and artists.
