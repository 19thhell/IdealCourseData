About the hawks     NYU is committed to protecting biodiversity for its own merit, and to enhance our pedagogical mission to educate students and engage the public. When Bobby and Violet, a pair of red-tailed hawks , made their home on the windowsill outside President John Sextons office on the 12th floor of Bobst Library , they took the city by storm.    Millions watched the Hawkcam video streaming live on the internet, witnessing these intensely beautiful and sophisticated creatures as they built a nest, laid eggs, and successfully hatched and fledged offspring - only to experience sorrow first-hand as Violet passed away after being captured by authorities for emergency surgery for a prior leg injury.    The red-tailed hawks are just one example of urban biodiversity. Just look at the dozens of street tree species, butterflies and honeybees pollinating flowerbeds, and indigenous landscaping on green rooftops and courtyards. Nature is itself in and of the city, and NYU is striving to better integrate biodiversity into its building design, landscaping and other practices for a more holistic approach to environmental decision-making.           FAQ     Q. How do I tell the difference between Bobby and Violet?    A. Females are normally larger, and we can assume that Violet is the one on the eggs most of the time. It also seems that Violet has a small white mark on the back of her head.        Q. How big are they?    A. 20-25 inches long, with a 4&frac12; foot wingspan.

Shatkin, M.D., M.P.H.   CAMS Program Adviser   Tommy Canale Offered by the College of Arts and Science in cooperation with the Child Study Center at the NYU School of Medicine , this minor aims to heighten students\u2019 awareness of childhood mental health issues and their sustained impact on adolescents and adults. In the child and adolescent mental health studies (CAMS) minor, students will (1) explore the relationship between human behavior and its biological and environmental bases; (2) increase their intellectual curiosity and build analytic and problem-solving skills; (3) be challenged to think critically about the concepts of \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d versus \u201cabnormal\u201d behavior and engage in a meta-level analysis of the social, historical, and cultural context of mental health, illness, and diagnosis; and (4) be encouraged\u2014if they have a natural interest in and inclination toward careers in social work, education and special education, psychology, law, medicine, sociology, nursing, public health, and scientific journalism\u2014to consider focusing their future career in some significant capacity on children and adolescents.
