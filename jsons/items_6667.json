[7]/[8] ANTH GA 1218-19 &amp; ANTH GA 1218-19    VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail) 8 PTS   (Prerequisite: Sight and Sound Documentary or equivalent)         COURSE DESCRIPTIONS (REQUIRED)    CULTURE &amp; MEDIA I (Ganti/Ginsburg)    This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world. Ethnographic film has a peculiar and highly contested status within anthropology, cinema studies, and documentary practice. In this seminar, we will situate ethnographic film within the wider project of the representation of cultural lives, and especially \"natives\". Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of the genre, we will examine how these emerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. We will then consider the key works that have defined the genre, and the epistemological and formal innovations associated with them, addressing questions concerning social theory, documentary, as well as the institutional structures through which they are funded, distributed, and seen by various audiences. Throughout the course we will keep in mind the properties of film as a signifying practice, its status as a form of anthropological knowledge, and the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation.   CULTURE &amp; MEDIA II: ETHNOGRAPHY OF MEDIA (Ginsburg/Ganti)    In the last decade, a new field \u2014 the ethnography of media \u2014 has emerged as an exciting new arena of research. While claims about media in peoples lives are made on a daily basis, surprisingly little research has actually attempted to look at how media is part of the naturally occurring lived realities of people\u2019s lives. In the last decade, anthropologists and media scholars interested in film, television, and video have been turning their attention increasingly beyond the text and empiricist notions of audiences, (stereotypically associated with the ethnography of media), to consider, ethnographically, the complex social worlds in which media is produced, circulated and consumed, at home and elsewhere. This work theorizes media studies from the point of view of cross-cultural ethnographic realities and anthropology from the perspective of new spaces of communication focusing on the social, economic and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice, whether in production, reception, or circulation.    The class will be organized around case studies that interrogate broader issues that are particularly endemic to questions of cross-cultural media including debates over cultural imperialism vs. the autonomy of local producers/consumers, the instability and stratification of reception, the shift from national to transnational circuits of production and consumption, the increasing complicity of researchers with their subjects over representations of culture, and the historically and culturally contingent ways in which images are read and used. These concerns are addressed in a variety of locations, from the complex circulation of films, photos, and lithographs, to the ever increasing range of televisual culture \u2014 from state sponsored melodramas, religious epics and soap operas, to varieties of public television; to the activist use of video, radio, the internet, and small media.    CULTURAL THEORY AND THE DOCUMENTARY (Toby Lee)    This course considers the actual and possible forms of relation between theories of culture and society and the mode of nonfiction cinema known as (social) documentary. From one perspective, theory is a discourse of explanation that is applied, concurrently or retroactively, to the images of culture presented in documentary films: films present raw material of culture to be theorized aesthetically, sociologically, psychologically, historically, politically, and so on. But at the same time, documentary filmmaking can be conceived as an intellectual discourse, what its founders called \u201ca method of philosophic reasoning\u201d (Paul Rotha), one meant to reflect or challenge certain cultural and social ideas. Despite the order of terms in the title of this course, what theory means to documentary, and vice versa, has always been an open question. This course explores various ways to answer the question.    SIGHT AND SOUND DOCUMENTARY (SUMMER COURSE) (Marco Williams)    The intensive six week summer course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and analysis of feature length and short documentaries, and hands-on directing, shooting, sound-recording, editing and re-editing, students will rigorously explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction story telling for film and video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group production work, in which each student will be expected to complete five projects. While tuition is covered, please be advised that there is a lab fee of approximately $600.   VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail )    A two-semester seminar that provides training and equipment for advanced graduate students to produce a media ethnography or short documentary. During the fall semester, in-class instruction, lab exercises, and readings introduce digital audio and video production, including shooting and editing with HD cameras, professional audio equipment, and Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Focusing on ethnographic media practices, students also address key representational, methodological, and ethical issues in the production of ethnographic documentary. By the completion of the fall term, students will have chosen a topic and field site for their final projects and completed a short video (5-10 minutes). During the spring semester, students continue to work intensively on their projects by shooting, editing, and screening their footage. The course culminates in a public screening of students\u2019 completed, 20-30 min. ethnographic documentaries. Attendance in class and lab sessions is mandatory, and students who fail to complete all fall assignments will not be allowed to register for the spring semester. Students should come into the class with a well-developed project idea.    THE SEMINAR IS RESTRICTED TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA. IT IS LIMITED TO TEN STUDENTS AND REQUIRES PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTOR. Culture &amp; Media I and Sight and Sound Documentary (summer session) are mandatory pre-requisites. There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. For a list of recent student documentaries click here.    SELECTED ELECTIVE COURSES/ CINEMA STUDIES and ANTHROPOLOGY/FALL 2014       Culture, Meaning and Society ANTH-GA 1222 (Rogers) This introduction to sociocultural anthropology is designed for graduate students working primarily in other disciplines, and is intended to give them a grasp of specifically anthropological ways of defining researchable questions, collecting data, and drawing inference. In the first half of the semester, we will consider the 20thcentury development of some of the basic concepts and practices that have defined the discipline (notably the culture concept, ethnographic fieldwork methods). In the second half of the semester, we will read a series of recent ethnographic case-studies to further explore current anthropological approaches to a selection of specific topics. These will be chosen largely as a function of student interests, but may include gender, religion, education, among others. *** Open only to non-Anthropology Graduate students.  Documentary Traditions CINE GT 1400 (Bagnall) Mondays 6:20 \u2013 9 PM   Fourteen sessions are devoted to a comparison of current documentaries with those made in earlier decades to illustrate how the art has responded to social, political, and economic realities and to changes in technology and systems of distribution. Undergraduates who take the course for 3 points are required to keep journals in which they respond to each session and compare observations with those made when viewing at least one documentary of their choice seen outside class, as well as in response to critical essays provided at each session and references in the text. Those wishing to earn an extra point (register for one point of H56.1097 Independent Study) may write a substantial term paper based on a topic approved by the instructor. French New Wave CINE GT 1513 (Stam) This course offers an historical and critical overview of one of the most dynamic and influential film movements within the history of the cinema -- the French New Wave \u2013 a movement that has influenced filmmakers all over the world. After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the movement in philosophical existentialism (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir) and the theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cinema, we will examine key films and directors. We will explore the three core groups that together formed the New Wave, notably 1) the Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette, Rohmer); 2) the Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker); and 3) Cinema Verite (Jean Rouch, Edgar Morin). While we will focus largely on the films themselves, we will situate New Wave films within a broader spectrum of philosophy, literature, and the art. Some key themes in the course will be: first-person auteur cinema; artistic modernism and the New Wave; the relation between film and the other arts; the revolution in film language; the filmic adaptation of novels; and feminism and the New Wave; race, gender and sexuality; the evolution of style; and the political evolution leading up to the near-revolution of May 1968. The course will approach the New Wave through 1) critical writing, including by the directors themselves; 2) the screening of a chronologically arranged series of feature films; and 3) the analysis of short clips related to the larger themes. The goal of the course is for students to gain an overall sense of the historical importance of the New Wave, of the characteristic styles and themes of the key directors, and of some of the theories that circulated around such films. Topics in Documentary Film CINE GT 2002 (Lee) The term \"expanded documentary\" points both to the ways in which traditional documentary practices have diversified and transformed over the last few decades, particularly with changes in media technologies, as well as to different ways we might re-examine other film, media and art traditions through the lens of documentary practice. In this course, we consider how the documentary impulse functions in film, video, animation, sound; in the gallery, in the archive, in public space, in cyberspace; in forms linear and nonlinear, online and off. We also investigate the role of documentation in relation to performance and social practice art. In tracing these variations of documentary practice over time, we approach these expanded forms of non-fiction media not as addenda to documentary traditions, but rather as opportunities to reflect critically on those traditions, to connect present developments to historical precedents, and to pry open our sense of documentary as form, endeavor and practice. (Cross-listed with CINE-UT 417) Nonfiction Film History CINE GT 2307 (Streible, TBA) This course introduces students to the study of nonfiction film. It explores the history and theory of nonfiction cinema, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014documentary film. The established milestones of the international tradition of documentary\u2014from the romantic mythmaking of Robert Flaherty to the leftist collectives and state propaganda projects of the 1930s and 1940s, through cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 of the 1960s and the activist and personal styles of recent decades\u2014are considered. But the course also places documentary in a broader context that includes forms of nonfiction typically segregated from the traditional conception of documentary. Some are somewhat familiar forms, such as actualities, travelogues, and newsreels. Others have been largely ignored by scholars until quite recently: sponsored, industrial, educational, scientific, and medical films; home movies and other amateur films; outtakes and other archival footage. Viewed both as discrete works of cinema and as artifacts of social and cultural significance, such orphaned films pose problems of history, culture, and aesthetics that challenge traditional conceptions of making, viewing, and studying films. Students read primary historical sources, as well as new scholarly approaches to the global history of nonfiction film, and to the possible uses and meanings of this vast archive.   Adv. Sem. Paradigms of Globalization CINE GT 2835 (Choi) This course examines multiple histories, structures, theories and key concepts of globalization, linking them with issues in the nation-state, post/modernity, post/colonialism, cultural imperialism, post/Fordism, empire, and trans/national identities. It brings together different forms of knowledge from anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy to bear on film and media studies troubled by geo-cultural uncertainty and convergence. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email JungBong Choi at jbc7@nyu.edu . The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/ reading/ research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar. Adv. Sem. Comparative Post-colonialism CINE GT 3207 (Stam) Alongside and in the aftermath of the \"culture wars\" in the United States, many battle lines, national and transnational, have formed around such inter-related issues as \"postcoloniality,\" \"comparative imperialism,\"\"critical race\" and so forth. Challenged and debated from many directions, the terms themselves have become subject to diverse political force-fields, in some ways becoming sliding signifiers onto which diverse groups project their hopes and fears, their fantasies and anxieties. Our seminar will focus on the ways these debates are articulated differently in three zones: the Anglo-American, the French and Francophone, and the Brazilian Lusophone. What will interest us specifically will be the process of translation through which the debates are filtered. How do the debates\"travel\" and what happens to them during the voyage? What happens in the movement from one geographical space and cultural semantics into another? How do these movements translate? What are the different vocabularies? How do the terms themselves shift political and epistemological valence? What happens, then, when \"multiculturalism\" or\"postcoloniality,\" for example, are seen through other national grids, or enter other \"intellectual fields?\" How are \"out-of-place\" ideas reinvoiced, indigenized, co-opted, contained, hybridized, recontextualized, resisted? What is elided or added, or subtly changed, in the process of cross-cultural translation? How do the debates get grafted onto other, preexisting debates? What are the mirrors and grids and prisms through which the debates are seen? What is the role of national narcissism and exceptionalism? What anxieties and Utopians come into play when debates travel? Our approach throughout will be transdisciplinary, drawing on cultural studies, media studies, literary theory, and so forth.We will address the ways that popular culture can filter and reframe the debates. Popular culture, in this sense, will be invoked as illustrative of our larger themes but also as a form of intellectual/cultural agency in a globalized world. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email Robert Stam at rps1@nyu.edu by April 15. The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/reading/research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar.

This course explores various ways to answer the question.    SIGHT AND SOUND DOCUMENTARY (SUMMER COURSE) (Marco Williams)    The intensive six week summer course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and analysis of feature length and short documentaries, and hands-on directing, shooting, sound-recording, editing and re-editing, students will rigorously explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction story telling for film and video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group production work, in which each student will be expected to complete five projects. While tuition is covered, please be advised that there is a lab fee of approximately $600.   VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail )    A two-semester seminar that provides training and equipment for advanced graduate students to produce a media ethnography or short documentary. During the fall semester, in-class instruction, lab exercises, and readings introduce digital audio and video production, including shooting and editing with HD cameras, professional audio equipment, and Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Focusing on ethnographic media practices, students also address key representational, methodological, and ethical issues in the production of ethnographic documentary. By the completion of the fall term, students will have chosen a topic and field site for their final projects and completed a short video (5-10 minutes). During the spring semester, students continue to work intensively on their projects by shooting, editing, and screening their footage. The course culminates in a public screening of students\u2019 completed, 20-30 min. ethnographic documentaries. Attendance in class and lab sessions is mandatory, and students who fail to complete all fall assignments will not be allowed to register for the spring semester. Students should come into the class with a well-developed project idea.    THE SEMINAR IS RESTRICTED TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA. IT IS LIMITED TO TEN STUDENTS AND REQUIRES PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTOR. Culture &amp; Media I and Sight and Sound Documentary (summer session) are mandatory pre-requisites. There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. For a list of recent student documentaries click here.    SELECTED ELECTIVE COURSES/ CINEMA STUDIES and ANTHROPOLOGY/FALL 2014       Culture, Meaning and Society ANTH-GA 1222 (Rogers) This introduction to sociocultural anthropology is designed for graduate students working primarily in other disciplines, and is intended to give them a grasp of specifically anthropological ways of defining researchable questions, collecting data, and drawing inference. In the first half of the semester, we will consider the 20thcentury development of some of the basic concepts and practices that have defined the discipline (notably the culture concept, ethnographic fieldwork methods). In the second half of the semester, we will read a series of recent ethnographic case-studies to further explore current anthropological approaches to a selection of specific topics. These will be chosen largely as a function of student interests, but may include gender, religion, education, among others. *** Open only to non-Anthropology Graduate students.  Documentary Traditions CINE GT 1400 (Bagnall) Mondays 6:20 \u2013 9 PM   Fourteen sessions are devoted to a comparison of current documentaries with those made in earlier decades to illustrate how the art has responded to social, political, and economic realities and to changes in technology and systems of distribution. Undergraduates who take the course for 3 points are required to keep journals in which they respond to each session and compare observations with those made when viewing at least one documentary of their choice seen outside class, as well as in response to critical essays provided at each session and references in the text. Those wishing to earn an extra point (register for one point of H56.1097 Independent Study) may write a substantial term paper based on a topic approved by the instructor. French New Wave CINE GT 1513 (Stam) This course offers an historical and critical overview of one of the most dynamic and influential film movements within the history of the cinema -- the French New Wave \u2013 a movement that has influenced filmmakers all over the world. After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the movement in philosophical existentialism (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir) and the theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cinema, we will examine key films and directors. We will explore the three core groups that together formed the New Wave, notably 1) the Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette, Rohmer); 2) the Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker); and 3) Cinema Verite (Jean Rouch, Edgar Morin). While we will focus largely on the films themselves, we will situate New Wave films within a broader spectrum of philosophy, literature, and the art. Some key themes in the course will be: first-person auteur cinema; artistic modernism and the New Wave; the relation between film and the other arts; the revolution in film language; the filmic adaptation of novels; and feminism and the New Wave; race, gender and sexuality; the evolution of style; and the political evolution leading up to the near-revolution of May 1968. The course will approach the New Wave through 1) critical writing, including by the directors themselves; 2) the screening of a chronologically arranged series of feature films; and 3) the analysis of short clips related to the larger themes. The goal of the course is for students to gain an overall sense of the historical importance of the New Wave, of the characteristic styles and themes of the key directors, and of some of the theories that circulated around such films. Topics in Documentary Film CINE GT 2002 (Lee) The term \"expanded documentary\" points both to the ways in which traditional documentary practices have diversified and transformed over the last few decades, particularly with changes in media technologies, as well as to different ways we might re-examine other film, media and art traditions through the lens of documentary practice. In this course, we consider how the documentary impulse functions in film, video, animation, sound; in the gallery, in the archive, in public space, in cyberspace; in forms linear and nonlinear, online and off. We also investigate the role of documentation in relation to performance and social practice art. In tracing these variations of documentary practice over time, we approach these expanded forms of non-fiction media not as addenda to documentary traditions, but rather as opportunities to reflect critically on those traditions, to connect present developments to historical precedents, and to pry open our sense of documentary as form, endeavor and practice. (Cross-listed with CINE-UT 417) Nonfiction Film History CINE GT 2307 (Streible, TBA) This course introduces students to the study of nonfiction film. It explores the history and theory of nonfiction cinema, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014documentary film. The established milestones of the international tradition of documentary\u2014from the romantic mythmaking of Robert Flaherty to the leftist collectives and state propaganda projects of the 1930s and 1940s, through cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 of the 1960s and the activist and personal styles of recent decades\u2014are considered. But the course also places documentary in a broader context that includes forms of nonfiction typically segregated from the traditional conception of documentary. Some are somewhat familiar forms, such as actualities, travelogues, and newsreels. Others have been largely ignored by scholars until quite recently: sponsored, industrial, educational, scientific, and medical films; home movies and other amateur films; outtakes and other archival footage. Viewed both as discrete works of cinema and as artifacts of social and cultural significance, such orphaned films pose problems of history, culture, and aesthetics that challenge traditional conceptions of making, viewing, and studying films. Students read primary historical sources, as well as new scholarly approaches to the global history of nonfiction film, and to the possible uses and meanings of this vast archive.   Adv. Sem. Paradigms of Globalization CINE GT 2835 (Choi) This course examines multiple histories, structures, theories and key concepts of globalization, linking them with issues in the nation-state, post/modernity, post/colonialism, cultural imperialism, post/Fordism, empire, and trans/national identities. It brings together different forms of knowledge from anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy to bear on film and media studies troubled by geo-cultural uncertainty and convergence. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email JungBong Choi at jbc7@nyu.edu . The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/ reading/ research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar. Adv. Sem. Comparative Post-colonialism CINE GT 3207 (Stam) Alongside and in the aftermath of the \"culture wars\" in the United States, many battle lines, national and transnational, have formed around such inter-related issues as \"postcoloniality,\" \"comparative imperialism,\"\"critical race\" and so forth. Challenged and debated from many directions, the terms themselves have become subject to diverse political force-fields, in some ways becoming sliding signifiers onto which diverse groups project their hopes and fears, their fantasies and anxieties. Our seminar will focus on the ways these debates are articulated differently in three zones: the Anglo-American, the French and Francophone, and the Brazilian Lusophone. What will interest us specifically will be the process of translation through which the debates are filtered. How do the debates\"travel\" and what happens to them during the voyage? What happens in the movement from one geographical space and cultural semantics into another? How do these movements translate? What are the different vocabularies? How do the terms themselves shift political and epistemological valence? What happens, then, when \"multiculturalism\" or\"postcoloniality,\" for example, are seen through other national grids, or enter other \"intellectual fields?\" How are \"out-of-place\" ideas reinvoiced, indigenized, co-opted, contained, hybridized, recontextualized, resisted? What is elided or added, or subtly changed, in the process of cross-cultural translation? How do the debates get grafted onto other, preexisting debates? What are the mirrors and grids and prisms through which the debates are seen? What is the role of national narcissism and exceptionalism? What anxieties and Utopians come into play when debates travel? Our approach throughout will be transdisciplinary, drawing on cultural studies, media studies, literary theory, and so forth.We will address the ways that popular culture can filter and reframe the debates. Popular culture, in this sense, will be invoked as illustrative of our larger themes but also as a form of intellectual/cultural agency in a globalized world. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email Robert Stam at rps1@nyu.edu by April 15.

Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.   Sample Syllabus                          Anthropology                                                 Anthropology of Indigenous Australia - ANTH-UA 9037 - 4 points                               This course offers an introduction to some of the classical and current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia. The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.

It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

This course is a rigorous, quantitative introduction to financial market structure and financial asset valuation. This course seeks to equip students with a fundamental understanding of the concepts and principles of finance. The main topics of the course are time value of money, portfolio selection, equilibrium asset pricing (CAPM), equity valuation, arbitrage pricing, fixed income securities and derivatives. You are expected to understand valuation formulas and be able to apply them to new problems. The appropriate tools necessary for solving these problems will be developed at each stage and practiced in the homework assignments. The models we will cover have immediate applications and implications for real-world financial decisions. Every effort will be made to relate the course material to current financial news.   Throughout the course the emphasis will be on two main areas: learning conceptual knowledge through theory and problem solving; and critical thinking through the application of real-life scenarios and local cases. The course will incorporate aspects of Australian securities market and financial institutions and a comparative approach will be adopted in demonstrating similarities and differences between the U.S. capital market and the Australian capital market.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the concepts and skills needed to create and critique effective marketing. Marketers in all organisations require an understanding of the many facets of marketing, beyond simply advertising or communications. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:   \u201cMarketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\u201d   The course focuses on the role of marketing and its importance in contemporary organisations and society. During the session, students will critically explore marketing principles, concepts and models from a practical perspective. Beyond studying the theory of marketing, students will analyse a variety of real-world examples and case studies. Organisations need to create a balanced, coordinated marketing mix, where all elements of its marketing activities work together. Marketing also requires combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to gain an understanding and reveal insights into the internal and external environment. To achieve this, the course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, case studies, assignments and exams. The remainder of this syllabus describes the course and students responsibilities.

The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

In this course we consider the cultural reverberations of ecological awareness\u2014focusing on literature, cinema and visual art. Eco-criticism is a relatively young field of study in the humanities, developed in response to twin crises: actual environmental degradation, and a breakdown in intellectual categories of \u2018the natural\u2019 brought on by technology and politics. This course provides an opportunity to reflect on a number of key tropes in ecological thinking including wilderness, pollution, animals, food and apocalypse. Learn about a philosopher who survived a crocodile attack, the beach at the end of the world, how to prepare and eat Australian moths, and why the Large Hadron Collider is a metaphysical machine. Principle texts in this course include American and Australian novels, films and documentaries, read alongside supplementary sources in literary, audio and artistic mediums. We ask how literature\u2014one of the richest arenas for the practice of human imagination\u2014does, has, or could shape environmental thought and action. How does the non-human world enter into human artforms? What are the historical and structural obstacles to admitting different forms of consciousness into text?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

Application required.   This 2-credit course is designed to complement and enhance your 2-credit internship fieldwork placement completed during the same semester at NYU Sydney. The seminar provides the structure for you to explore many different aspects of your internship site, and to gain more from your experience by comparing and contrasting the internship experiences of all class participants. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization hosting your internship, including its mission, approach, policies, and the context in which it operates. More generally, we will consider the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Throughout the semester we will take note of similarities and differences of Australian and American workplaces and work culture. Ultimately, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience, and on your personal and future professional goals.

Though its waters connect places as diverse as Patagonia, Kamchatka, Hawai\u2019I, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Sydney, histories of these disparate regions and their societies can profitably be considered under a common rubric. This course brings together work across disciplines, from history, anthropology, geography, political economy, and cultural studies, to piece together the contours of the Pacific Ocean, c. 1500 to c. 1850, as a historical arena of internal linkages as well as one forged by connections with the wider world. Central themes of the course will include cultural encounters, comparative empires, trade, and environmental change.

Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.

The Australian Experience - SCA-UA 9809 - 4 points                               This course offers a wide-ranging critique of Australian culture and society. It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Certificate Program in Culture and Media     The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a specialized joint course of study leading to a New York State Certificate in Culture and Media for NYU graduate students who are also pursuing their PhD degrees in Anthropology or Cinema Studies. The program\u2019s philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationships   between culture and media in a number of domains including: ethnographic   film\u2019s significance for the fields of anthropology and cinema/media   studies; problems in representation of cultures through media; the   development of media in indigenous, Diaspora, and non-Western   communities; the emerging social and cultural formations shaped by new   media practices; the political economy shaping the production,   distribution and consumption of media worldwide; and the impact of new   media technologies on these processes.   This graduate program provides a focused course of studies   integrating production with theory and research. Training in this   program will enable students to pursue the following:   -Production work in state-of-the-art digital video based on their   own research, resulting in a twenty-thirty minute documentary. Student   works have shown in festivals worldwide, won multiple awards, and are in   distribution.  For a list of recent student documentaries click here .      -Ethnographic research into the social practice of media in a range of   communities and cultures. Students from the program have done PhD   research on the development of media in diverse settings, from the   emergence of film and TV in Papua New Guinea, to circulation of   religious media in Northern Nigeria.    -Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documentary and related issues.    -A career in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such as   specialized programming and distribution of ethnographic film and   video, community-based documentary production, management of   ethnographic film/video libraries and archives, or work in new media.  Each year, two student works are selected for a pitch session at the prestigious SILVERDOCS documentary festival. http://silverdocs.com/ .

[7]/[8] ANTH GA 1218-19 &amp; ANTH GA 1218-19    VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail) 8 PTS   (Prerequisite: Sight and Sound Documentary or equivalent)         COURSE DESCRIPTIONS (REQUIRED)    CULTURE &amp; MEDIA I (Ganti/Ginsburg)    This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world. Ethnographic film has a peculiar and highly contested status within anthropology, cinema studies, and documentary practice. In this seminar, we will situate ethnographic film within the wider project of the representation of cultural lives, and especially \"natives\". Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of the genre, we will examine how these emerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. We will then consider the key works that have defined the genre, and the epistemological and formal innovations associated with them, addressing questions concerning social theory, documentary, as well as the institutional structures through which they are funded, distributed, and seen by various audiences. Throughout the course we will keep in mind the properties of film as a signifying practice, its status as a form of anthropological knowledge, and the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation.   CULTURE &amp; MEDIA II: ETHNOGRAPHY OF MEDIA (Ginsburg/Ganti)    In the last decade, a new field \u2014 the ethnography of media \u2014 has emerged as an exciting new arena of research. While claims about media in peoples lives are made on a daily basis, surprisingly little research has actually attempted to look at how media is part of the naturally occurring lived realities of people\u2019s lives. In the last decade, anthropologists and media scholars interested in film, television, and video have been turning their attention increasingly beyond the text and empiricist notions of audiences, (stereotypically associated with the ethnography of media), to consider, ethnographically, the complex social worlds in which media is produced, circulated and consumed, at home and elsewhere. This work theorizes media studies from the point of view of cross-cultural ethnographic realities and anthropology from the perspective of new spaces of communication focusing on the social, economic and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice, whether in production, reception, or circulation.    The class will be organized around case studies that interrogate broader issues that are particularly endemic to questions of cross-cultural media including debates over cultural imperialism vs. the autonomy of local producers/consumers, the instability and stratification of reception, the shift from national to transnational circuits of production and consumption, the increasing complicity of researchers with their subjects over representations of culture, and the historically and culturally contingent ways in which images are read and used. These concerns are addressed in a variety of locations, from the complex circulation of films, photos, and lithographs, to the ever increasing range of televisual culture \u2014 from state sponsored melodramas, religious epics and soap operas, to varieties of public television; to the activist use of video, radio, the internet, and small media.    CULTURAL THEORY AND THE DOCUMENTARY (Toby Lee)    This course considers the actual and possible forms of relation between theories of culture and society and the mode of nonfiction cinema known as (social) documentary. From one perspective, theory is a discourse of explanation that is applied, concurrently or retroactively, to the images of culture presented in documentary films: films present raw material of culture to be theorized aesthetically, sociologically, psychologically, historically, politically, and so on. But at the same time, documentary filmmaking can be conceived as an intellectual discourse, what its founders called \u201ca method of philosophic reasoning\u201d (Paul Rotha), one meant to reflect or challenge certain cultural and social ideas. Despite the order of terms in the title of this course, what theory means to documentary, and vice versa, has always been an open question. This course explores various ways to answer the question.    SIGHT AND SOUND DOCUMENTARY (SUMMER COURSE) (Marco Williams)    The intensive six week summer course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and analysis of feature length and short documentaries, and hands-on directing, shooting, sound-recording, editing and re-editing, students will rigorously explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction story telling for film and video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group production work, in which each student will be expected to complete five projects. While tuition is covered, please be advised that there is a lab fee of approximately $600.   VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail )    A two-semester seminar that provides training and equipment for advanced graduate students to produce a media ethnography or short documentary. During the fall semester, in-class instruction, lab exercises, and readings introduce digital audio and video production, including shooting and editing with HD cameras, professional audio equipment, and Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Focusing on ethnographic media practices, students also address key representational, methodological, and ethical issues in the production of ethnographic documentary. By the completion of the fall term, students will have chosen a topic and field site for their final projects and completed a short video (5-10 minutes). During the spring semester, students continue to work intensively on their projects by shooting, editing, and screening their footage. The course culminates in a public screening of students\u2019 completed, 20-30 min. ethnographic documentaries. Attendance in class and lab sessions is mandatory, and students who fail to complete all fall assignments will not be allowed to register for the spring semester. Students should come into the class with a well-developed project idea.    THE SEMINAR IS RESTRICTED TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA. IT IS LIMITED TO TEN STUDENTS AND REQUIRES PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTOR. Culture &amp; Media I and Sight and Sound Documentary (summer session) are mandatory pre-requisites. There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. For a list of recent student documentaries click here.    SELECTED ELECTIVE COURSES/ CINEMA STUDIES and ANTHROPOLOGY/FALL 2014       Culture, Meaning and Society ANTH-GA 1222 (Rogers) This introduction to sociocultural anthropology is designed for graduate students working primarily in other disciplines, and is intended to give them a grasp of specifically anthropological ways of defining researchable questions, collecting data, and drawing inference. In the first half of the semester, we will consider the 20thcentury development of some of the basic concepts and practices that have defined the discipline (notably the culture concept, ethnographic fieldwork methods). In the second half of the semester, we will read a series of recent ethnographic case-studies to further explore current anthropological approaches to a selection of specific topics. These will be chosen largely as a function of student interests, but may include gender, religion, education, among others. *** Open only to non-Anthropology Graduate students.  Documentary Traditions CINE GT 1400 (Bagnall) Mondays 6:20 \u2013 9 PM   Fourteen sessions are devoted to a comparison of current documentaries with those made in earlier decades to illustrate how the art has responded to social, political, and economic realities and to changes in technology and systems of distribution. Undergraduates who take the course for 3 points are required to keep journals in which they respond to each session and compare observations with those made when viewing at least one documentary of their choice seen outside class, as well as in response to critical essays provided at each session and references in the text. Those wishing to earn an extra point (register for one point of H56.1097 Independent Study) may write a substantial term paper based on a topic approved by the instructor. French New Wave CINE GT 1513 (Stam) This course offers an historical and critical overview of one of the most dynamic and influential film movements within the history of the cinema -- the French New Wave \u2013 a movement that has influenced filmmakers all over the world. After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the movement in philosophical existentialism (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir) and the theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cinema, we will examine key films and directors. We will explore the three core groups that together formed the New Wave, notably 1) the Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette, Rohmer); 2) the Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker); and 3) Cinema Verite (Jean Rouch, Edgar Morin). While we will focus largely on the films themselves, we will situate New Wave films within a broader spectrum of philosophy, literature, and the art. Some key themes in the course will be: first-person auteur cinema; artistic modernism and the New Wave; the relation between film and the other arts; the revolution in film language; the filmic adaptation of novels; and feminism and the New Wave; race, gender and sexuality; the evolution of style; and the political evolution leading up to the near-revolution of May 1968. The course will approach the New Wave through 1) critical writing, including by the directors themselves; 2) the screening of a chronologically arranged series of feature films; and 3) the analysis of short clips related to the larger themes. The goal of the course is for students to gain an overall sense of the historical importance of the New Wave, of the characteristic styles and themes of the key directors, and of some of the theories that circulated around such films. Topics in Documentary Film CINE GT 2002 (Lee) The term \"expanded documentary\" points both to the ways in which traditional documentary practices have diversified and transformed over the last few decades, particularly with changes in media technologies, as well as to different ways we might re-examine other film, media and art traditions through the lens of documentary practice. In this course, we consider how the documentary impulse functions in film, video, animation, sound; in the gallery, in the archive, in public space, in cyberspace; in forms linear and nonlinear, online and off. We also investigate the role of documentation in relation to performance and social practice art. In tracing these variations of documentary practice over time, we approach these expanded forms of non-fiction media not as addenda to documentary traditions, but rather as opportunities to reflect critically on those traditions, to connect present developments to historical precedents, and to pry open our sense of documentary as form, endeavor and practice. (Cross-listed with CINE-UT 417) Nonfiction Film History CINE GT 2307 (Streible, TBA) This course introduces students to the study of nonfiction film. It explores the history and theory of nonfiction cinema, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014documentary film. The established milestones of the international tradition of documentary\u2014from the romantic mythmaking of Robert Flaherty to the leftist collectives and state propaganda projects of the 1930s and 1940s, through cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 of the 1960s and the activist and personal styles of recent decades\u2014are considered. But the course also places documentary in a broader context that includes forms of nonfiction typically segregated from the traditional conception of documentary. Some are somewhat familiar forms, such as actualities, travelogues, and newsreels. Others have been largely ignored by scholars until quite recently: sponsored, industrial, educational, scientific, and medical films; home movies and other amateur films; outtakes and other archival footage. Viewed both as discrete works of cinema and as artifacts of social and cultural significance, such orphaned films pose problems of history, culture, and aesthetics that challenge traditional conceptions of making, viewing, and studying films. Students read primary historical sources, as well as new scholarly approaches to the global history of nonfiction film, and to the possible uses and meanings of this vast archive.   Adv. Sem. Paradigms of Globalization CINE GT 2835 (Choi) This course examines multiple histories, structures, theories and key concepts of globalization, linking them with issues in the nation-state, post/modernity, post/colonialism, cultural imperialism, post/Fordism, empire, and trans/national identities. It brings together different forms of knowledge from anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy to bear on film and media studies troubled by geo-cultural uncertainty and convergence. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email JungBong Choi at jbc7@nyu.edu . The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/ reading/ research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar. Adv. Sem. Comparative Post-colonialism CINE GT 3207 (Stam) Alongside and in the aftermath of the \"culture wars\" in the United States, many battle lines, national and transnational, have formed around such inter-related issues as \"postcoloniality,\" \"comparative imperialism,\"\"critical race\" and so forth. Challenged and debated from many directions, the terms themselves have become subject to diverse political force-fields, in some ways becoming sliding signifiers onto which diverse groups project their hopes and fears, their fantasies and anxieties. Our seminar will focus on the ways these debates are articulated differently in three zones: the Anglo-American, the French and Francophone, and the Brazilian Lusophone. What will interest us specifically will be the process of translation through which the debates are filtered. How do the debates\"travel\" and what happens to them during the voyage? What happens in the movement from one geographical space and cultural semantics into another? How do these movements translate? What are the different vocabularies? How do the terms themselves shift political and epistemological valence? What happens, then, when \"multiculturalism\" or\"postcoloniality,\" for example, are seen through other national grids, or enter other \"intellectual fields?\" How are \"out-of-place\" ideas reinvoiced, indigenized, co-opted, contained, hybridized, recontextualized, resisted? What is elided or added, or subtly changed, in the process of cross-cultural translation? How do the debates get grafted onto other, preexisting debates? What are the mirrors and grids and prisms through which the debates are seen? What is the role of national narcissism and exceptionalism? What anxieties and Utopians come into play when debates travel? Our approach throughout will be transdisciplinary, drawing on cultural studies, media studies, literary theory, and so forth.We will address the ways that popular culture can filter and reframe the debates. Popular culture, in this sense, will be invoked as illustrative of our larger themes but also as a form of intellectual/cultural agency in a globalized world. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email Robert Stam at rps1@nyu.edu by April 15. The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/reading/research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar.

Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.   Sample Syllabus                          Anthropology                                                 Anthropology of Indigenous Australia - ANTH-UA 9037 - 4 points                               This course offers an introduction to some of the classical and current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia. The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.

This course is a rigorous, quantitative introduction to financial market structure and financial asset valuation. This course seeks to equip students with a fundamental understanding of the concepts and principles of finance. The main topics of the course are time value of money, portfolio selection, equilibrium asset pricing (CAPM), equity valuation, arbitrage pricing, fixed income securities and derivatives. You are expected to understand valuation formulas and be able to apply them to new problems. The appropriate tools necessary for solving these problems will be developed at each stage and practiced in the homework assignments. The models we will cover have immediate applications and implications for real-world financial decisions. Every effort will be made to relate the course material to current financial news.   Throughout the course the emphasis will be on two main areas: learning conceptual knowledge through theory and problem solving; and critical thinking through the application of real-life scenarios and local cases. The course will incorporate aspects of Australian securities market and financial institutions and a comparative approach will be adopted in demonstrating similarities and differences between the U.S. capital market and the Australian capital market.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the concepts and skills needed to create and critique effective marketing. Marketers in all organisations require an understanding of the many facets of marketing, beyond simply advertising or communications. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:   \u201cMarketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\u201d   The course focuses on the role of marketing and its importance in contemporary organisations and society. During the session, students will critically explore marketing principles, concepts and models from a practical perspective. Beyond studying the theory of marketing, students will analyse a variety of real-world examples and case studies. Organisations need to create a balanced, coordinated marketing mix, where all elements of its marketing activities work together. Marketing also requires combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to gain an understanding and reveal insights into the internal and external environment. To achieve this, the course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, case studies, assignments and exams. The remainder of this syllabus describes the course and students responsibilities.

The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

In this course we consider the cultural reverberations of ecological awareness\u2014focusing on literature, cinema and visual art. Eco-criticism is a relatively young field of study in the humanities, developed in response to twin crises: actual environmental degradation, and a breakdown in intellectual categories of \u2018the natural\u2019 brought on by technology and politics. This course provides an opportunity to reflect on a number of key tropes in ecological thinking including wilderness, pollution, animals, food and apocalypse. Learn about a philosopher who survived a crocodile attack, the beach at the end of the world, how to prepare and eat Australian moths, and why the Large Hadron Collider is a metaphysical machine. Principle texts in this course include American and Australian novels, films and documentaries, read alongside supplementary sources in literary, audio and artistic mediums. We ask how literature\u2014one of the richest arenas for the practice of human imagination\u2014does, has, or could shape environmental thought and action. How does the non-human world enter into human artforms? What are the historical and structural obstacles to admitting different forms of consciousness into text?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

Sample Syllabus                              Media, Culture, &amp; Communication                                                  Global Media Seminar - MCC-UE 9456 - 4 points                               This course examines diverse issues and perspectives related to global media. Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In other words: students, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.     Sample Syllabus                                                                      Social Psychology - PSYCH-UA 9032 - 4 points                               Prerequisite for NYU Students: PSYCH-UA 1/Introduction to Psychology   This course advances the understanding of major principles and findings of social psychology. This course will specifically discuss four main areas: (1) the science of social psychology; (2) the individual within the social world; (3) the impact individuals have on another individual or group; and (4) social relationships.   The course will be in lecture format, but class discussion and participation is expected. Therefore, preparation prior to each class is necessary.

The Australian Experience - SCA-UA 9809 - 4 points                               This course offers a wide-ranging critique of Australian culture and society. It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Truxes       The Master of Arts Program in World  History introduces students to the methods and approaches used by scholars to  study global and transnational history.    It also engages students in comparative and thematic work exploring the  history of at least two world regions.    This program is aimed at those who are seeking a historical perspective  on the increasingly interconnected global society in which we live. Among those whose needs may be served by the  MA in World History are educators, professionals involved in international occupations,  journalists or others working in the field of communications, and those  exploring their own interests through the study of global history. Acceptance into the World History MA Program  does not constitute admission into the Ph.D. program in the History Department  at New York University, but students intending to pursue a Ph.D. may later  apply for admission.      The core curriculum depends on the  student\u2019s choice of pursuing either the \u201cMA Essay Track\u201d or the \u201c Thesis  Track .\u201d The MA Essay track includes  eight one-semester courses (32 credit points), including three core courses,  three courses in a major field of study, and two courses in a minor field of  study.      The Masters Essay is a rewrite (a  developed and improved version) of a semester-length paper that has earned a  grade of \u2018A-\u2019 or above in one of the courses taken by a student in the World  History MA program. Students will submit their Masters Essays, together  with the original version of the paper (containing the grade and comments of  the course instructor) to the director of the World History MA program in the  semester before graduation. Students must present a master\u2019s essay, and they  must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language relevant to their  work.       The Thesis track includes eight  one-semester courses (32 credit points), including three core courses, two or  three courses in a major field of study, one or two courses in a minor field of  study, and a thesis course. Full-time  students wishing to write a thesis must declare their intention to do so by the  end of their first semester; part-time students must declare by the end of their second semester.  Students must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language relevant to  their work. Students may take cognate  courses in World History in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s program in  Humanities and Social Thought, and, with approval, up to two courses in  anthropology, sociology, politics, economics, or literature.      Students must undertake study of two  regions of the world, one of which will be designated as the major field and  one as the minor. The available regions are: Africa, East Asia, South Asia,  Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and North America.  Students must elect at least one field outside of Europe and North America.

They will  qualify for the degree when their master\u2019s essay has been approved or their  thesis successfully completed. Part-time  students will be allowed to stretch the program out over a maximum of six  semesters. Students may petition to  substitute one course that does not fit the above program if their special  needs, interests, or background justify it.    All course substitutions must be approved by the Program Director and  submitted to the Graduate Program Administrator.
