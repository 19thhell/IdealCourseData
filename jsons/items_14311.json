Whether you're living in one of the residence halls centered around Washington Square in Greenwich Village, in Brooklyn Heights, or in a residence hall located in one of the city's other bustling neighborhoods, there is an endless amount of activity and things to do and see. Traveling to other areas of NYU and around the city is simple and affordable too, thanks to NYU's transportation services and New York City's extensive public transportation system. Both are easy to use and will ensure that you take advantage of all that New York City offers.     Below you will find a complete list of our residence halls. Each residence hall falls into one or more of the following three categories:     #FYRE: refers to the First-Year Residential Experience; residence halls that house first-year students     #Grad: refers to residence halls that house graduate students     #UC: refers to residence halls that house upperclass students (sophomores, juniors &amp; seniors)     In addition, each residence hall is categorized as apartment-style or traditional and falls into one of the following two categories:       #Apt: refers to apartment-style residence halls. In apartment-style halls, a kitchen is provided in the suite/apartment or a communal kitchen is available. Residents are not required to have a meal plan.   #Trad : refers to traditional residence halls. In traditional halls, a kitchen is not provided in the suite and residents are required to maintain a meal plan.
