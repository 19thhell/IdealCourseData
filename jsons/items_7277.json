The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

Research explores the ways artistic projects informed by oral history have impacted popular culture. Readings, listening to public radio documentaries, and viewing films will be used to address the balance in accurately reflecting the realities and integrity of the people represented while staying true to the vision of the artist. Readings include (but are not limited to): Art Spiegelman\u2019s\u00a0 Maus I &amp; II \u00a0; Works by Studs Terkel including\u00a0 Working \u00a0and\u00a0 Will the Circle Be Unbroken \u00a0; Greg Halpern\u2019s\u00a0 Harvard Works Because We Do \u00a0, listening to audio and reading\u00a0 Slave Narratives \u00a0from\u00a0 Remember Slavery \u00a0project, Smithsonian; Anna Deveare Smith, and Dave Isay. For final projects students create collaborative or solo work in the discipline of their own training; theatre, artist books, photography, poetry, music, radio, audio art, film or video.
