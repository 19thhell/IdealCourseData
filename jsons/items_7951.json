The requirements leading up to the Ph.D degree are designed to train students in fundamental concepts, oral presentation skills, scientific reasoning, design of experiments and/or theoretical models, and writing technical papers/reports. The overarching goal of the student's graduate training is the achievement of research excellence in a chosen sub-discipline of chemistry. To facilitate choosing a laboratory and a research adviser, each faculty member gives a short presentation on his/her research to the first-year students. First-Year student are then asked to do two laboratory rotations during their first semester in residence. This Laboratory experience provides students with direct exposure to techniques and methodology used in the various labs and helps them to choose a thesis adviser. Other courses taken during the first year of study, provide a background in concepts, methods, and problems that will be the foundation for independent research.      Students are admitted to Ph.D. candidacy by completion of course requirements in any division with a GPA of 3.0 or better and by satisfactory performance on the candidacy examination, taken in the middle of the second year. Students participate in seminars within their divisions and prepare research proposals, both on their own research and on an original topic. Detailed requirements for the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees are listed in the Graduate School of Arts &amp; Science Bulletin ; the most recent details are in Requirement section on this web site.      All full time Ph.D. students are supported by MacCracken Fellowships as described in the Financial Aid section. Advanced students may be supported as research assistants or on special fellowships.
