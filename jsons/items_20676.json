Examination          The grade of the course is based on your score on the main exam. But in order to pass the course   you must do (i) four labs (one of which requires a lab report) and (ii) complete a computer    project and make a poster presentation.            Special events               27/4 (N420), Lab info. The lab assistans will outline the work in the lab, and    make a lab schedule.             TBD. Course outlook at umu. Prof. Thomas W&aring;gberg will give a 20-minute talk on how concepts     and methods from the course is used at the forefront of research.              25/5. Course evaluation."}, {"content": "L.
