Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

A student must earn at least 30 of these credits - approximately 10 courses - with a letter grade of B (not B-minus) or better. At any given time, to remain in good standing (i.e., not to be on probation) the student is expected to be maintaining an overall grade point average of at least B (3.0) and must have at least 66% of the credits attempted over prior semesters at NYU successfully completed. A student cannot have more than three IPs or Ns (combined) on his/her transcript that are more than 2 semesters old or else the student will not be eligible for any university aid.  Note: Pass/Fail grades do not count as letter grades although they do count for credit. For more details on the grading system, see the  Bulletin of the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) . Students who are supported as Teaching or Research Assistants normally take three courses each semester, typically two content courses and 3 points of predoctoral research credit. In addition, students must attend the Area Seminar in Cognition and Perception (for those students specializing in developmental psychology, the Area Seminar in Developmental Psychology is also required). Finally, the C&amp;P students are expected to attend the \"Brown Bag\" research meeting that is organized and hosted by them and which provides a forum for their and the faculty's current research strategies, methods and data. Course Curriculum     There are each worth 3 credits per course unless otherwise noted. Each     core course must be earned at a grade of B (not B-minus) to count toward     fulfilling the requirements of the C&amp;P Program. Course information can     be looked up on the web at various addresses. For Psychology PhD course-listings,     click here .     Quantitative Methods     Students are required to take two courses in quantitative methods for research.     Most students in our program satisfy one of the two semesters of this requirement with Mathematical Tools for Cognitive Science and Neuroscience. This course covers core mathematical tools used in our field, including     linear algebra, probability, estimation, linear systems and Fourier analysis,     and includes an introduction to the theory as well as hands-on computation     using Matlab. However, with the agreement of your advisor, you may satisfy     this requirement with courses from the list below or with other courses     available in our department or the graduate departments of Mathematics or     Statistics (in the Leonard N. Stern School of Business). Here are some of     the courses that might be used to satisfy this requirement:         PSYCH-GA.2211 Mathematical Tools for Cognitive Science and Neuroscience (= NEURL-GA.2207)     PSYCH-GA.2229 Regression (Shrout)     PSYCH-GA.2233 Simulation and Data Analysis (Maloney)     PSYCH-GA.2236 Linear Systems (Maloney)     PSYCH-GA.2239 ANOVA (Cohen)     PSYCH-GA.2240 Psychophysics (Landy)     PSYCH-GA.2244 Multivariate Statistical Analysis (Maloney)     PSYCH-GA.2245 Functional magnetic resonance imaging lab (Heeger)     PSYCH-GA.2247 Advanced Seminar: Structural Equations (Shrout)     PSYCH-GA.2248 Analysis of Change (Shrout)     MATH-GA.2962 Mathematical Statistics (non-psych course)     PSYCH-GA.340X Linear and Generalized Linear Models (Maloney)     STAT-GB.3301 Introduction to the Theory of Probability (non-psych course)         STAT-GB.3302 Statistical Inference and Regression Analysis (non-psych course)             Content Courses     Students are required to take four core content courses. One of these is satisfied by the first-year research requirement (the first-year talk and paper) which is graded and the grade is logged as the grade to a pre-doctoral research course. The other three courses may be chosen from among the following four options:  PSYCH-GA.2221 Behavioral &amp; Cognitive Neuroscience = NEURL-GA.2205  PSYCH-GA.2223 Perception     PSYCH-GA.2209 Cognitive Development     One of the following cognitive courses          PSYCH-GA.2207 Categories and Concepts     PSYCH-GA.2212 Neuroeconomics and Decision      PSYCH-GA.2225 Memory      PSYCH-GA.2226 Psycholinguistics      PSYCH-GA.3405 Neurolinguistics      PSYCH-GA.340X Learning                  These courses are generally given once every year or two. It is advisable for students to complete these three courses by the end of the second year in the Program. Only one of the cognitive courses counts as a Core Content course. If a student takes more than one, the additional ones count as advanced electives. Advanced Electives     To achieve a total of 30 graded credits, students must also complete four advanced electives. One of these is satisfied by the second-year research requirement (the second-year talk and paper) which is graded and the grade is logged as the grade to a pre-doctoral research course. The other three courses can be satisfied by any courses approved by your advisor and advisory committee, including additional quantitative courses, additional Core Content courses, and other advanced electives. Most of the advanced electives in Cognition &amp; Perception are given every two or three years. The Neural Science core courses are given every year. Here are some of the courses you might consider for your advanced electives:  PSYCH-GA.2012 Physiological Basis of Behavior (MA)  PSYCH-GA.2201 Cellular, Molecular &amp; Developmental Neuroscience (4 credits)  = NEURL-GA.2201  PSYCH-GA.2202 Sensory and Motor Neuroscience (4 credits) = NEURL-GA.2202  PSYCH-GA.2203 Laboratory in Neural Science I = NEURL-GA.2203  PSYCH-GA.2204 Laboratory in Neural Science II = NEURL-GA.2204  PSYCH-GA.2207 Categories and Concepts  PSYCH-GA.2209 Cognitive Development  PSYCH-GA.2212 Judgment and Decision Making  PSYCH-GA.2214 Language Acquisition PSYCH-GA.2225 Memory  PSYCH-GA.2226 Psycholinguistics  PSYCH-GA.2245 Functional Magnetic Imaging Lab  PSYCH-GA.3210 Seminar in Psycholinguistics  PSYCH-GA.3214 Social Development  PSYCH-GA.3220 Seminar in Cognitive, Perceptual and Language Development  PSYCH-GA.3233 Seminar in Perception  PSYCH-GA.3326 Seminar in Memory and Cognition PSYCH-GA.340X Attention  LING-GA.1110 Phonetics  LING-GA.1310 Syntax  LING-GA.1340 Semantics  LING-GA.2350 The Interface of Language and Cognition  NEURL-GA.3042 Special Topics: Memory Systems Transfer Credits In the case of a student joining our program with graduate credit from elsewhere, the student in consultation with his or her advisor should go over the transcript and discuss possible substitutes. In the case of a core course, the substitute must be approved by the instructor of the course. The advisor should send a memo proposing any possible substitutions to the program coordinator for approval. It should be noted that a minimum of 32 credits (of the 72 required for the doctorate) must be taken in residence at New York University, putting a natural limit on the maximum number of transfer credits accepted. Further, if more than 21 credits are transferred, there is a risk that the student's MacCracken Fellowship support will be cut one year (from 5 to 4 years). Research Requirements First Year  Research Advisor . Students are urged to contact faculty whose research  interests are close to their own within the first few weeks of their first  semester. In a few meetings it should be possible to determine if there is  sufficient mutual interest for a particular faculty member to serve as a student's  research advisor. It is a good idea to talk with the advisor's current students  and to get their perspective on the lab.   Research \"Advisory\" Committee . By the end of the first year of  study, students will submit nominations of two faculty who, in addition to  the advisor, will form a committee which will supervise research work until  the dissertation committee is formed, usually in the third year. One of these  committee members should have research interests outside the student's area  of interest; this person will serve as the committee chair. The student proposes  the membership of the committee to the Program Coordinator who will try to  equalize the workload across the faculty.      First-Year Paper . At the end of the first year, students are     required to submit a paper and then give a short talk about their research.     The talk is given in the annual Miniconvention which     currently takes place in mid-September. The paper should be submitted     to the Coordinator and members of the student's Advisory Committee by     the Tuesday after Labor Day. This paper can be in the form of a research     paper or a research proposal. It is strongly encouraged that the paper     be based on pilot research data already collected by that time. In length,     the paper is typically about 15 pages, single-spaced, in the form of a     NIMH pre-doctoral fellowship or of an APA journal article. Students are     encouraged to develop this paper into a proposal for pre-doctoral support     (e.g., from NSF or NIH). This paper will receive a grade that will be     logged as the grade of a pre-doctoral research course and will count as     a core content course for the Program course requirements. Students are     encouraged to give a talk in the informal Brown Bag research meetings     as a forum for gleaning advice on the research ideas and methods which     the paper will later formally report.     Second Year     Second-Year Paper . At the end of the second year, students     are required to submit another paper and then give another short talk     about their research. The talk is given in the annual Miniconvention     which currently takes place in mid-September. The paper should be submitted     to the Coordinator and members of the student's Advisory Committee by     the Tuesday after Labor Day. Typically, this is in the form of an APA-style     research report prepared for submission to a professional journal of either     the completion of the first-year project or of a second project done subsequently.     In addition to providing the basis for committee evaluation of research     progress, this paper or a revised version of it should be submitted for     publication. This paper will receive a grade that will be logged as the     grade of a pre-doctoral research course and will count as an advanced     elective for the Program course requirements.       Lab Rotations . Although not required, students are encouraged to  spend time in more than one laboratory during their graduate career. This  is most easily accomplished by working on two projects in two different laboratories  prior to the commencement of the dissertation proposal. Third Year  Dissertation Proposal . In the third year, it is expected that each  student will have sufficiently clarified his or her interests to be able to  formally propose a dissertation project (see Procedures  Pertaining to the Doctoral Dissertation ). This proposal may or may not  include pilot data but it must reflect a mastery of the conceptual and methodological  basis of the problem. The proposal should be presented in both written and  oral form by the end of the third year to a dissertation committee which is  appointed by the department chair in consultation with the student's chosen  sponsor. This committee replaces the student advisory committee and is comprised  of three persons, all of whom are experts in some aspect of the proposed work.  Research Approvals:     All research by psychology students that involves the use of human subjects     must be approved by the NYU University     Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects . In some cases, an     expedited review can be obtained from the faculty representatives to that     committee from the Department (currently Profs. Heilman     and Uleman ). Forms     may be obtained from the Subject Pool coordinator (presently Jim     Uleman ) on the 7th floor. Also, you may contact Catharine Lennon, Associate     Subject Pool Coordinator - her subject pool address is:     psych.subjects@nyu.edu . All research involving animal subjects must     be approved by the NYU Animal Welfare Committee. See Prof.     Hawken for further information or consult     www.nyu.edu/uawc .     Teaching Experience Requirements Being able to communicate knowledge to others and judge from their feedback whether the communication was successful - i.e., to teach - plays an integral part in testing out one's own knowledge and in extending it to the creation of more knowledge. Further, this teaching skill when well honed finds significant employment for its proponents in many walks of life. This is particularly true in academia where the probabilities are high that many of our C&amp;P students will eventually hold jobs. Hence, providing learning experiences in teaching is an important part of our educational goals. It's a goal we seek to achieve by placing our students in apprenticeships with experienced teachers from whom they can learn how best to communicate in the classroom information from different domains of psychology and to evaluate the adequacy of that communication and improve upon it. Such learning experiences are provided for in part by the 5-year support plan for MacCracken Fellows in which each recipient is normally assigned five semesters of teaching assistantships to be distributed one semester per year. This assignment can be reduced to as low as the Graduate School's minimum of two if the recipient also functions on a paid research assistantship or successfully obtains an externally funded fellowship. Each full year of support reduces the teaching obligation by one semester. The Summer Teaching Practicum is yet another avenue by which the department meets its commitment to train its graduate students in teaching as well as research skills. The Practicum provides its more qualified students paid opportunities in the summer to teach (not TA) an undergraduate course on their own but under expert supervision. For more details see Summer Funding .  Other Requirements Mini-Convention     The Mini-Convention is a day-long, convention-type meeting currently held     on the Friday a week-and-a-half after Labor Day in September (see Calendar ).     Faculty and students of the Program attend this meeting which provides a     training experience in convention-style oral presentation. All first- and     second-year students are required to present talks based on their research     projects. Upper-year students with well-worked-out, interesting findings     to report are encouraged to present talks, as well as those who have not     presented at a Brown Bag for the past academic year.     Language Requirement Psychology students are not required to fulfill this GSAS requirement. Computer Competence Because modern research is dependent upon a high level of competence in the use of sophisticated computers, students in the Cognition and Perception Program are expected to acquire a reasonably high level of proficiency during their stay at New York University. Windows, Macintosh and UNIX (Linux) systems are generally available, all with Internet and Web access. Time Limit in the Program For each student who has had a dissertation proposal formally accepted by the Department, his/her dissertation committee will meet at least in the spring and fall of each year to consider the dissertation's progress. (see Dissertation Procedures ) The spring meeting will also serve to review all aspects of the student's record to date and to form (in particular for students completing the 5th year or greater) a recommendation to the Program Coordinator regarding the student's continuation in the program. The judgment will be made on the basis of the student's recent progress, not on future promises. Students who have not made sufficient progress will be terminated and/or will be allowed only restricted use of program facilities (offices, etc.). Students who have completed their seventh year of work without defending their dissertation will automatically be terminated from the program unless the committee recommends an extension because of extraordinary circumstances. Terminated students can petition for readmission if it becomes possible for them to persuade faculty that they are viable degree candidates. If they are readmitted, however, they are subject to the payment of all matriculation fees covering the period from the end of their initial active status to the time of readmission. Students who have reached their 72 credit requirement and wish to remain on full-time matriculated status without taking the 12 semester credits ordinarily required may do so by filing the full-time equivalency form. After having done so, the usual semester matriculation fees will be waived for the next 6 semesters (three years). Thereafter, those students will have to pay a matriculation fee for each additional semester they remain ungraduated. A further repercussion of this status shift is that those students with university loans outstanding at New York University or elsewhere automatically become subject in six months to payback requirements. It is to the student's advantage to complete the program within four or five years. This will improve job prospects. Highly Recommended Presentation of Research Papers at Professional Meetings The Program strongly encourages its students to present papers (or posters) on their research at relevant professional meetings around the country as a \"real life\" part of their education in becoming professional scientists and educators and to aid them in forming contacts for possible jobs and postdocs after the Ph.D. Forums for such presentations exist at the annual meetings of the Eastern Psychological Association (EPA), American Psychological Association (APA), Society for Neuroscience, Psychonomics Society, ARVO, Vision Science Society, etc. Please inquire of your advisors the deadlines for submitting presentation applications to the relevant societies. If a paper or poster on which you will be the presenting author is accepted for presentation, you can request a travel award from the Dean to cover expenses, but you must complete an application and be approved in advance. Application forms are available here . It is a good idea to complete the travel fund applications as early as possible in the relevant semester since the travel money pool (budgeted by the Dean) is limited and allocated on a \"first come, first served\" basis.     Publications     It is important to have publications during your tenure in the program.     This will improve your vita when you are entering the job market. Also consult     Self-obtained Fellowships and Scholarships .     You might find inspiration in the Gu &amp; Bourne (2007)\u00a0 &quot;10     rules&quot; of advice for graduate students . Please suggest links to     other helpful publications.     Receiving an M.A. Degree All students in the Cognition and Perception Program are eligible to receive the M.A. degree as soon as they have:  Submitted a 2nd year paper that is deemed acceptable by the student's advisory committee;  Completed 36 points of graduate studies, at least 18 of which must be at a grade of B or better. No fewer than 27 of these must have been obtained at New York University; and  Satisfied core course requirements (Quantitative Methods, Content Courses). To receive the degree, the student must register for graduation via ALBERT or complete the application on TORCHTONE (212-995-4747). This must be done at least three months before the desired date of degree (exact deadlines are available from the Academic Affairs Office, Room 158, Psychology Building). We encourage each student to take these steps to receive the M.A. when the opportunity arises, and to do so as soon as possible. It is to the benefit of both the student and the Program. Please note that GSAS will not grant a student both an MA and a PhD in the same calendar year. Student Evaluations Evaluations for first- and second-year students consist of the following three steps. Step 3 applies to all students.         Submission of a Research Proposal or Paper to committee members and     Program Coordinator (the Tuesday after Labor Day).     A talk based on your research to be given in the Mini-Convention (1st-     and 2nd-year students) in September (the Friday 10 days later);     A yearly evaluation committee meeting is scheduled in September by the     Program Administrator for each student. For students having an approved     dissertation proposal, the committee is their dissertation committee;     otherwise, it is their advisory committee. Students should be prepared     to discuss their past and planned coursework and research as well as their     TA experience. Students should bring an evaluation form partially filled     out by the Program Administrator as well as a self-evaluation by the student     of the year's progress and achievements and a CV including talks, publications     and fellowship applications and funding. First- and second-year students     should schedule this meeting between the Miniconvention and the subsequent     student evaluation faculty meeting, leaving the committee sufficient time     to read their papers. Upper-year students should schedule these meetings     prior to the Miniconvention.         All students should have finished a proposal by the middle of the fourth year. To enforce this requirement, students cannot register for the fourth year (second semester) unless they have an approved proposal. Student evaluations are important monitors of how the student is progressing toward the Ph.D. In the student evaluation faculty meeting, the faculty use the results of these committee evaluations to identify problems that a student may have and how these may be overcome. In some instances, decisions as to awards or probations are made (see Time Limit in the Program ). You will receive written feedback from your committee chair or Program Coordinator after this meeting. Two Routes to the Dissertation You may take one of the following two approaches to fulfilling the thesis requirement in the Cognition and Perception Program: Route One (The Traditional Thesis): You may prepare a traditional dissertation under the approval and guidance of your sponsor and thesis committee. However, because the responsibility of scientists to make the results of their work available to their colleagues is of paramount importance, the Cognition and Perception Program urges candidates to prepare their dissertations in such a way that some or all of the dissertation may be directly submitted for publication to a professional journal.     Route Two (Publications): Having completed all other requirements of the Ph.D. and having consulted your sponsor, you may submit for approval to your thesis committee (consisting of three committee members and two readers) three research or theoretical papers in place of a dissertation. Your dissertation committee is the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes an acceptable thesis. However, our usual standards are that two of these papers be published in major professional journals (with high standards of review) on the basis of work you have carried out while in the Cognition and Perception Program by the time of the defense. The third paper must not yet be published (in particular, it must not yet be copyrighted by a journal). On two of the three papers, you should be the main author, responsible for writing the first draft. If not obvious, your role should be indicated in the acknowledgements. Your published papers, in manuscript copy form, will be appendixed to your unpublished paper in accordance with the rules of the NYU Recording office which requires your thesis to be unpublished. The papers need not be on the same topic, but when they are bound together, they should have appended whatever ancillary material (i.e., fuller exposition of the research background, methodology, analysis, discussion and/or data tables) that your thesis committee deems appropriate. Calendar         First Tuesday after Labor Day in September: 1st- and 2nd-year papers     are due.

Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

A student must earn at least 30 of these credits - approximately 10 courses - with a letter grade of B (not B-minus) or better. At any given time, to remain in good standing (i.e., not to be on probation) the student is expected to be maintaining an overall grade point average of at least B (3.0) and must have at least 66% of the credits attempted over prior semesters at NYU successfully completed. A student cannot have more than three IPs or Ns (combined) on his/her transcript that are more than 2 semesters old or else the student will not be eligible for any university aid.  Note: Pass/Fail grades do not count as letter grades although they do count for credit. For more details on the grading system, see the  Bulletin of the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) . Students who are supported as Teaching or Research Assistants normally take three courses each semester, typically two content courses and 3 points of predoctoral research credit. In addition, students must attend the Area Seminar in Cognition and Perception (for those students specializing in developmental psychology, the Area Seminar in Developmental Psychology is also required). Finally, the C&amp;P students are expected to attend the \"Brown Bag\" research meeting that is organized and hosted by them and which provides a forum for their and the faculty's current research strategies, methods and data. Course Curriculum     There are each worth 3 credits per course unless otherwise noted. Each     core course must be earned at a grade of B (not B-minus) to count toward     fulfilling the requirements of the C&amp;P Program. Course information can     be looked up on the web at various addresses. For Psychology PhD course-listings,     click here .     Quantitative Methods     Students are required to take two courses in quantitative methods for research.     Most students in our program satisfy one of the two semesters of this requirement with Mathematical Tools for Cognitive Science and Neuroscience. This course covers core mathematical tools used in our field, including     linear algebra, probability, estimation, linear systems and Fourier analysis,     and includes an introduction to the theory as well as hands-on computation     using Matlab. However, with the agreement of your advisor, you may satisfy     this requirement with courses from the list below or with other courses     available in our department or the graduate departments of Mathematics or     Statistics (in the Leonard N. Stern School of Business). Here are some of     the courses that might be used to satisfy this requirement:         PSYCH-GA.2211 Mathematical Tools for Cognitive Science and Neuroscience (= NEURL-GA.2207)     PSYCH-GA.2229 Regression (Shrout)     PSYCH-GA.2233 Simulation and Data Analysis (Maloney)     PSYCH-GA.2236 Linear Systems (Maloney)     PSYCH-GA.2239 ANOVA (Cohen)     PSYCH-GA.2240 Psychophysics (Landy)     PSYCH-GA.2244 Multivariate Statistical Analysis (Maloney)     PSYCH-GA.2245 Functional magnetic resonance imaging lab (Heeger)     PSYCH-GA.2247 Advanced Seminar: Structural Equations (Shrout)     PSYCH-GA.2248 Analysis of Change (Shrout)     MATH-GA.2962 Mathematical Statistics (non-psych course)     PSYCH-GA.340X Linear and Generalized Linear Models (Maloney)     STAT-GB.3301 Introduction to the Theory of Probability (non-psych course)         STAT-GB.3302 Statistical Inference and Regression Analysis (non-psych course)             Content Courses     Students are required to take four core content courses. One of these is satisfied by the first-year research requirement (the first-year talk and paper) which is graded and the grade is logged as the grade to a pre-doctoral research course. The other three courses may be chosen from among the following four options:  PSYCH-GA.2221 Behavioral &amp; Cognitive Neuroscience = NEURL-GA.2205  PSYCH-GA.2223 Perception     PSYCH-GA.2209 Cognitive Development     One of the following cognitive courses          PSYCH-GA.2207 Categories and Concepts     PSYCH-GA.2212 Neuroeconomics and Decision      PSYCH-GA.2225 Memory      PSYCH-GA.2226 Psycholinguistics      PSYCH-GA.3405 Neurolinguistics      PSYCH-GA.340X Learning                  These courses are generally given once every year or two. It is advisable for students to complete these three courses by the end of the second year in the Program. Only one of the cognitive courses counts as a Core Content course. If a student takes more than one, the additional ones count as advanced electives. Advanced Electives     To achieve a total of 30 graded credits, students must also complete four advanced electives. One of these is satisfied by the second-year research requirement (the second-year talk and paper) which is graded and the grade is logged as the grade to a pre-doctoral research course. The other three courses can be satisfied by any courses approved by your advisor and advisory committee, including additional quantitative courses, additional Core Content courses, and other advanced electives. Most of the advanced electives in Cognition &amp; Perception are given every two or three years. The Neural Science core courses are given every year. Here are some of the courses you might consider for your advanced electives:  PSYCH-GA.2012 Physiological Basis of Behavior (MA)  PSYCH-GA.2201 Cellular, Molecular &amp; Developmental Neuroscience (4 credits)  = NEURL-GA.2201  PSYCH-GA.2202 Sensory and Motor Neuroscience (4 credits) = NEURL-GA.2202  PSYCH-GA.2203 Laboratory in Neural Science I = NEURL-GA.2203  PSYCH-GA.2204 Laboratory in Neural Science II = NEURL-GA.2204  PSYCH-GA.2207 Categories and Concepts  PSYCH-GA.2209 Cognitive Development  PSYCH-GA.2212 Judgment and Decision Making  PSYCH-GA.2214 Language Acquisition PSYCH-GA.2225 Memory  PSYCH-GA.2226 Psycholinguistics  PSYCH-GA.2245 Functional Magnetic Imaging Lab  PSYCH-GA.3210 Seminar in Psycholinguistics  PSYCH-GA.3214 Social Development  PSYCH-GA.3220 Seminar in Cognitive, Perceptual and Language Development  PSYCH-GA.3233 Seminar in Perception  PSYCH-GA.3326 Seminar in Memory and Cognition PSYCH-GA.340X Attention  LING-GA.1110 Phonetics  LING-GA.1310 Syntax  LING-GA.1340 Semantics  LING-GA.2350 The Interface of Language and Cognition  NEURL-GA.3042 Special Topics: Memory Systems Transfer Credits In the case of a student joining our program with graduate credit from elsewhere, the student in consultation with his or her advisor should go over the transcript and discuss possible substitutes. In the case of a core course, the substitute must be approved by the instructor of the course. The advisor should send a memo proposing any possible substitutions to the program coordinator for approval. It should be noted that a minimum of 32 credits (of the 72 required for the doctorate) must be taken in residence at New York University, putting a natural limit on the maximum number of transfer credits accepted. Further, if more than 21 credits are transferred, there is a risk that the student's MacCracken Fellowship support will be cut one year (from 5 to 4 years). Research Requirements First Year  Research Advisor . Students are urged to contact faculty whose research  interests are close to their own within the first few weeks of their first  semester. In a few meetings it should be possible to determine if there is  sufficient mutual interest for a particular faculty member to serve as a student's  research advisor. It is a good idea to talk with the advisor's current students  and to get their perspective on the lab.   Research \"Advisory\" Committee . By the end of the first year of  study, students will submit nominations of two faculty who, in addition to  the advisor, will form a committee which will supervise research work until  the dissertation committee is formed, usually in the third year. One of these  committee members should have research interests outside the student's area  of interest; this person will serve as the committee chair. The student proposes  the membership of the committee to the Program Coordinator who will try to  equalize the workload across the faculty.      First-Year Paper . At the end of the first year, students are     required to submit a paper and then give a short talk about their research.     The talk is given in the annual Miniconvention which     currently takes place in mid-September. The paper should be submitted     to the Coordinator and members of the student's Advisory Committee by     the Tuesday after Labor Day. This paper can be in the form of a research     paper or a research proposal. It is strongly encouraged that the paper     be based on pilot research data already collected by that time. In length,     the paper is typically about 15 pages, single-spaced, in the form of a     NIMH pre-doctoral fellowship or of an APA journal article. Students are     encouraged to develop this paper into a proposal for pre-doctoral support     (e.g., from NSF or NIH). This paper will receive a grade that will be     logged as the grade of a pre-doctoral research course and will count as     a core content course for the Program course requirements. Students are     encouraged to give a talk in the informal Brown Bag research meetings     as a forum for gleaning advice on the research ideas and methods which     the paper will later formally report.     Second Year     Second-Year Paper . At the end of the second year, students     are required to submit another paper and then give another short talk     about their research. The talk is given in the annual Miniconvention     which currently takes place in mid-September. The paper should be submitted     to the Coordinator and members of the student's Advisory Committee by     the Tuesday after Labor Day. Typically, this is in the form of an APA-style     research report prepared for submission to a professional journal of either     the completion of the first-year project or of a second project done subsequently.     In addition to providing the basis for committee evaluation of research     progress, this paper or a revised version of it should be submitted for     publication. This paper will receive a grade that will be logged as the     grade of a pre-doctoral research course and will count as an advanced     elective for the Program course requirements.       Lab Rotations . Although not required, students are encouraged to  spend time in more than one laboratory during their graduate career. This  is most easily accomplished by working on two projects in two different laboratories  prior to the commencement of the dissertation proposal. Third Year  Dissertation Proposal . In the third year, it is expected that each  student will have sufficiently clarified his or her interests to be able to  formally propose a dissertation project (see Procedures  Pertaining to the Doctoral Dissertation ). This proposal may or may not  include pilot data but it must reflect a mastery of the conceptual and methodological  basis of the problem. The proposal should be presented in both written and  oral form by the end of the third year to a dissertation committee which is  appointed by the department chair in consultation with the student's chosen  sponsor. This committee replaces the student advisory committee and is comprised  of three persons, all of whom are experts in some aspect of the proposed work.  Research Approvals:     All research by psychology students that involves the use of human subjects     must be approved by the NYU University     Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects . In some cases, an     expedited review can be obtained from the faculty representatives to that     committee from the Department (currently Profs. Heilman     and Uleman ). Forms     may be obtained from the Subject Pool coordinator (presently Jim     Uleman ) on the 7th floor. Also, you may contact Catharine Lennon, Associate     Subject Pool Coordinator - her subject pool address is:     psych.subjects@nyu.edu . All research involving animal subjects must     be approved by the NYU Animal Welfare Committee. See Prof.     Hawken for further information or consult     www.nyu.edu/uawc .     Teaching Experience Requirements Being able to communicate knowledge to others and judge from their feedback whether the communication was successful - i.e., to teach - plays an integral part in testing out one's own knowledge and in extending it to the creation of more knowledge. Further, this teaching skill when well honed finds significant employment for its proponents in many walks of life. This is particularly true in academia where the probabilities are high that many of our C&amp;P students will eventually hold jobs. Hence, providing learning experiences in teaching is an important part of our educational goals. It's a goal we seek to achieve by placing our students in apprenticeships with experienced teachers from whom they can learn how best to communicate in the classroom information from different domains of psychology and to evaluate the adequacy of that communication and improve upon it. Such learning experiences are provided for in part by the 5-year support plan for MacCracken Fellows in which each recipient is normally assigned five semesters of teaching assistantships to be distributed one semester per year. This assignment can be reduced to as low as the Graduate School's minimum of two if the recipient also functions on a paid research assistantship or successfully obtains an externally funded fellowship. Each full year of support reduces the teaching obligation by one semester. The Summer Teaching Practicum is yet another avenue by which the department meets its commitment to train its graduate students in teaching as well as research skills. The Practicum provides its more qualified students paid opportunities in the summer to teach (not TA) an undergraduate course on their own but under expert supervision. For more details see Summer Funding .  Other Requirements Mini-Convention     The Mini-Convention is a day-long, convention-type meeting currently held     on the Friday a week-and-a-half after Labor Day in September (see Calendar ).     Faculty and students of the Program attend this meeting which provides a     training experience in convention-style oral presentation. All first- and     second-year students are required to present talks based on their research     projects. Upper-year students with well-worked-out, interesting findings     to report are encouraged to present talks, as well as those who have not     presented at a Brown Bag for the past academic year.     Language Requirement Psychology students are not required to fulfill this GSAS requirement. Computer Competence Because modern research is dependent upon a high level of competence in the use of sophisticated computers, students in the Cognition and Perception Program are expected to acquire a reasonably high level of proficiency during their stay at New York University. Windows, Macintosh and UNIX (Linux) systems are generally available, all with Internet and Web access. Time Limit in the Program For each student who has had a dissertation proposal formally accepted by the Department, his/her dissertation committee will meet at least in the spring and fall of each year to consider the dissertation's progress. (see Dissertation Procedures ) The spring meeting will also serve to review all aspects of the student's record to date and to form (in particular for students completing the 5th year or greater) a recommendation to the Program Coordinator regarding the student's continuation in the program. The judgment will be made on the basis of the student's recent progress, not on future promises. Students who have not made sufficient progress will be terminated and/or will be allowed only restricted use of program facilities (offices, etc.). Students who have completed their seventh year of work without defending their dissertation will automatically be terminated from the program unless the committee recommends an extension because of extraordinary circumstances. Terminated students can petition for readmission if it becomes possible for them to persuade faculty that they are viable degree candidates. If they are readmitted, however, they are subject to the payment of all matriculation fees covering the period from the end of their initial active status to the time of readmission. Students who have reached their 72 credit requirement and wish to remain on full-time matriculated status without taking the 12 semester credits ordinarily required may do so by filing the full-time equivalency form. After having done so, the usual semester matriculation fees will be waived for the next 6 semesters (three years). Thereafter, those students will have to pay a matriculation fee for each additional semester they remain ungraduated. A further repercussion of this status shift is that those students with university loans outstanding at New York University or elsewhere automatically become subject in six months to payback requirements. It is to the student's advantage to complete the program within four or five years. This will improve job prospects. Highly Recommended Presentation of Research Papers at Professional Meetings The Program strongly encourages its students to present papers (or posters) on their research at relevant professional meetings around the country as a \"real life\" part of their education in becoming professional scientists and educators and to aid them in forming contacts for possible jobs and postdocs after the Ph.D. Forums for such presentations exist at the annual meetings of the Eastern Psychological Association (EPA), American Psychological Association (APA), Society for Neuroscience, Psychonomics Society, ARVO, Vision Science Society, etc. Please inquire of your advisors the deadlines for submitting presentation applications to the relevant societies. If a paper or poster on which you will be the presenting author is accepted for presentation, you can request a travel award from the Dean to cover expenses, but you must complete an application and be approved in advance. Application forms are available here . It is a good idea to complete the travel fund applications as early as possible in the relevant semester since the travel money pool (budgeted by the Dean) is limited and allocated on a \"first come, first served\" basis.     Publications     It is important to have publications during your tenure in the program.     This will improve your vita when you are entering the job market. Also consult     Self-obtained Fellowships and Scholarships .     You might find inspiration in the Gu &amp; Bourne (2007)\u00a0 &quot;10     rules&quot; of advice for graduate students . Please suggest links to     other helpful publications.     Receiving an M.A. Degree All students in the Cognition and Perception Program are eligible to receive the M.A. degree as soon as they have:  Submitted a 2nd year paper that is deemed acceptable by the student's advisory committee;  Completed 36 points of graduate studies, at least 18 of which must be at a grade of B or better. No fewer than 27 of these must have been obtained at New York University; and  Satisfied core course requirements (Quantitative Methods, Content Courses). To receive the degree, the student must register for graduation via ALBERT or complete the application on TORCHTONE (212-995-4747). This must be done at least three months before the desired date of degree (exact deadlines are available from the Academic Affairs Office, Room 158, Psychology Building). We encourage each student to take these steps to receive the M.A. when the opportunity arises, and to do so as soon as possible. It is to the benefit of both the student and the Program. Please note that GSAS will not grant a student both an MA and a PhD in the same calendar year. Student Evaluations Evaluations for first- and second-year students consist of the following three steps. Step 3 applies to all students.         Submission of a Research Proposal or Paper to committee members and     Program Coordinator (the Tuesday after Labor Day).     A talk based on your research to be given in the Mini-Convention (1st-     and 2nd-year students) in September (the Friday 10 days later);     A yearly evaluation committee meeting is scheduled in September by the     Program Administrator for each student. For students having an approved     dissertation proposal, the committee is their dissertation committee;     otherwise, it is their advisory committee. Students should be prepared     to discuss their past and planned coursework and research as well as their     TA experience. Students should bring an evaluation form partially filled     out by the Program Administrator as well as a self-evaluation by the student     of the year's progress and achievements and a CV including talks, publications     and fellowship applications and funding. First- and second-year students     should schedule this meeting between the Miniconvention and the subsequent     student evaluation faculty meeting, leaving the committee sufficient time     to read their papers. Upper-year students should schedule these meetings     prior to the Miniconvention.         All students should have finished a proposal by the middle of the fourth year. To enforce this requirement, students cannot register for the fourth year (second semester) unless they have an approved proposal. Student evaluations are important monitors of how the student is progressing toward the Ph.D. In the student evaluation faculty meeting, the faculty use the results of these committee evaluations to identify problems that a student may have and how these may be overcome. In some instances, decisions as to awards or probations are made (see Time Limit in the Program ). You will receive written feedback from your committee chair or Program Coordinator after this meeting. Two Routes to the Dissertation You may take one of the following two approaches to fulfilling the thesis requirement in the Cognition and Perception Program: Route One (The Traditional Thesis): You may prepare a traditional dissertation under the approval and guidance of your sponsor and thesis committee. However, because the responsibility of scientists to make the results of their work available to their colleagues is of paramount importance, the Cognition and Perception Program urges candidates to prepare their dissertations in such a way that some or all of the dissertation may be directly submitted for publication to a professional journal.     Route Two (Publications): Having completed all other requirements of the Ph.D. and having consulted your sponsor, you may submit for approval to your thesis committee (consisting of three committee members and two readers) three research or theoretical papers in place of a dissertation. Your dissertation committee is the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes an acceptable thesis. However, our usual standards are that two of these papers be published in major professional journals (with high standards of review) on the basis of work you have carried out while in the Cognition and Perception Program by the time of the defense. The third paper must not yet be published (in particular, it must not yet be copyrighted by a journal). On two of the three papers, you should be the main author, responsible for writing the first draft. If not obvious, your role should be indicated in the acknowledgements. Your published papers, in manuscript copy form, will be appendixed to your unpublished paper in accordance with the rules of the NYU Recording office which requires your thesis to be unpublished. The papers need not be on the same topic, but when they are bound together, they should have appended whatever ancillary material (i.e., fuller exposition of the research background, methodology, analysis, discussion and/or data tables) that your thesis committee deems appropriate. Calendar         First Tuesday after Labor Day in September: 1st- and 2nd-year papers     are due.
