Based on a training program called Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR), the classes involve the use of training DVDs and audiovisual recording of counseling sessions to help students develop self-awareness, personal and professional insight, and basic counseling skills.    Enrollment is open to matriculated NYU graduate students in the following departments: Applied Psychology, Drama Therapy, Dance Therapy, and Speech Pathology.    Be advised that Lab I is a prerequisite for Lab II. Lab I and Lab II are prerequisites for Internship I and Internship II.    Grading for the course is Pass/Incomplete/Fail. Students who miss more than two classes are given an incomplete or failing grade, depending upon circumstances. Those students in Lab I who have not acquired the necessary insight or skill level required for advancement to Lab II will be required to repeat Lab I.    Counseling Lab I Competencies       Mastery of the four basic skill sets introduced in the IPR tapes.    Understanding of and ability to engage in the IPR approach, i.e. client recall, counselor recall, mutual recall and the inquirer role.    Full participation in all lab activities are demonstrated by attendance and involvement in simulated counselor/client interactions, ability to examine skills as a counselor and giving feedback to other in their role plays.    Demonstrate progress through comparison of three marker tapes: beginning, midterm, and endof semester.    Evaluate progress at mid-term and end of semester with lab instructor. Evaluation includes all of the above activities, and for counseling students, indicates readiness to go on to Lab II. An Incomplete or Failure grade will be given to students who, in the judgment of the Instructor, have not made adequate progress.       Any counseling student who receives an incomplete or failure grade in Lab I will be subject to review by the Counseling Program Faculty.    Counseling Lab II Competencies       Ability to utilize the basic skills acquired in Lab I in a counseling situation.    Can conduct a basic counseling intake interview.

Full participation in all Lab activities as demonstrated by attendance and involvement in simulated counselor/client interactions, ability to examine skills as a counselor, and giving feedback to others in their role-plays.    Demonstrate progress through comparison of three marker tapes: beginning, mid-term and end of semester.    Evaluate progress at mid-term and end of semester with lab instructor. Evaluation includes all of the above activities, and for counseling students, indicates readiness to go on to fieldwork and practicum. An incomplete or failure grade will be given to students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not made adequate progress.       Any counseling student who receives an incomplete or failure grade in Lab II will be subject to review by the Counseling Program Faculty.    The Internship Sequence    Field learning is considered by many to be the center point of any counselor education program. It is strongly believed that counselors-in-training need the opportunity to combine their didactic learning with actual experience in a fieldwork setting where they can observe, develop clinical skills and practice the tasks typically associated with a professional counselor.    This clinical component of the program helps the counselor-in-training acquire an understanding of the role of the professional counselor. The student also develops a sense of professional identity and gains proficiency and confidence by applying his or her overall learning and emerging skills under the supervision of experienced, qualified and approved supervisors. Typically students will spend both semesters in the same internship site. In addition to the required hours in the field students are enrolled in an Internship seminar class. The internship experience is a preparation requirement for certification and /or licensure in all states.    Students in the School Counseling K-12 Program and the Bilingual School Counseling Program are required to complete a minimum of 2 full days or 14 hours per week, in each of two consecutive semesters in a school setting under the direct supervision of a licensed or certified school counselor (this is a state requirement). Bilingual School counseling students must complete their internship under the supervision of a NY State Certified Bilingual School Counselor.    Non-Credit Course for Drug and Alcohol Education/School Violence Prevention/Identifying and Reporting Child Abuse, TCHL-GE 2999    Students in the School Counseling and Bilingual School Counseling programs must take a workshop on drug and alcohol education, school violence prevention, and child abuse recognition. This single session, non-credit course should be taken concurrently with internship.       Terminal Experience    The Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Examination (CPCE) is currently the culminating experience for the MA program. The exam should be taken during the student's last semester of matriculation in the program. The fee for taking the CPCE is $45.00. It will be offered once in the fall and twice in the spring. Students have two opportunities to pass the examination. If they are unable to take or pass the exam, they can write an appeal outlining a proposed alternative educational experience to be presented to the M.A. Counseling Program Co-Directors for approval.       Electives    Special Population Courses    We define a special population as one in which the psychological development of the individual may be adversely affected by systematic societal factors related to the social class, gender, racial/ethnic status, age, disability, or other social positions.

The Internship Sequence    Field learning is considered by many to be the center point of any counselor education program. It is strongly believed that counselors-in-training need the opportunity to combine their didactic learning with actual experience in a fieldwork setting where they can observe, develop clinical skills and practice the tasks typically associated with a professional counselor.    This clinical component of the program helps the counselor-in-training acquire an understanding of the role of the professional counselor. The student also develops a sense of professional identity and gains proficiency and confidence by applying his or her overall learning and emerging skills under the supervision of experienced, qualified and approved supervisors. Typically students will spend both semesters in the same internship site. In addition to the required hours in the field students are enrolled in an Internship seminar class. The internship experience is a preparation requirement for certification and /or licensure in all states.    Students in the School Counseling K-12 Program and the Bilingual School Counseling Program are required to complete a minimum of 2 full days or 14 hours per week, in each of two consecutive semesters in a school setting under the direct supervision of a licensed or certified school counselor (this is a state requirement).
