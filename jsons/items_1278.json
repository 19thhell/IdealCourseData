Does not count toward the  major in French but does count toward the minor in French literature  in translation or the minor in literature in translation. Offered  every semester. 4 points.   Exposes the student to  various modes, such as expressionism, social realism, and the  projection of the hero. One film is viewed per week and analyzed with  reading assignments that include novels, plays, and poems. The  objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media and to  make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these  media so often focus.      Graduate Courses  Open to Undergraduates      Courses in the Graduate  School of Arts and Science are open to seniors with a 3.5 average in  three 4-point courses (12 points) of advanced work in French.

SESSION I: May 26th \u2013 July 2nd FREN-UA 10 Intensive Elementary French (6 points) MTWRF, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm Section 001 (#2510) -- Kaliane Ung / Gabriella Lindsay Section 002 (#2511) -- Tina Montenegro / Erika Hendrix This beginning-level French course is open to students with no previous training or experience in French. This intensive course is the equivalent of a year (two semesters) of regular elementary-level French. The work done throughout the session focuses on the presentation and systematic practice of the basic structures and vocabulary of oral and written French through a variety of creative activities that stress real-world contexts and communicative situations, situations that provide learners with the opportunity to develop their knowledge of French by creating, both orally and through writing, in the language. This course includes a robust online component. FREN-UA 30 Conversation &amp; Composition MTWR, 10:00am \u2013 12:00pm Melanie Hackney #2514 This fifth-semester French course is open to students who have completed one year (two semesters) of intermediate-level French (or one semester of intensive intermediate-level French). This course systematizes and reinforces language skills and functions presented in earlier courses through an intensive review of grammatical structures and usages, a variety of written activities, an introduction to composition writing, exercises and activities that promote lexical enrichment, and numerous opportunities to develop conversational and presentational skills. FREN-UA 883 (conducted in English ) Cinema and Literature Prof. William Wolf MW, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #2515 This course exposes the student to various modes, such as expressionism, social realism, and the projection of the hero. One film is viewed per week and analyzed with reading assignments that include novels, plays, and poems. The objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media and to make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these media so often focus. (Cross-listed as DRLIT-UA 504; does not count towards the requirements for the French major.)  SESSION II: July 8th \u2013 August 15th FREN-UA 1 Elementary French I Pierre Andr\u00e9 / Daniel Benson MTWR, 10:00am \u2013 12:30pm #2793 This beginning-level French course is open to students with no previous training or experience in French. The work done throughout the session focuses on the presentation and systematic practice of the initial basic structures and vocabulary of oral and written French through a variety of creative activities that stress real-world contexts and communicative situations, situations that provide learners with the opportunity to develop their knowledge of French by creating, both orally and through writing, in the language. This course includes a robust online component. FREN-UA 20 Intensive Intermediate French (6 points) MTWRF 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm Section 001 (#2512) -- Camilo Frias / Janos Kun Section 002 (#2513) -- Samantha Presnal / Lauren Weaver This intensive intermediate French course is designed to give students who have already mastered the basics of French vocabulary, culture, pronunciation, and grammar the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of the French language and the cultures for which it is a vehicle. This course not only allows students to gain even easier access to the thoughts, ideas, history, and production of hundreds of millions of French-speaking people scattered across every continent around the globe, but also prepares students to tackle advanced-level French courses. This course includes an intensive review and expansion of the most important grammatical structures through written and oral exercises and activities, the continued development of vocabulary through creative and communicative activities and projects, and extensive individual, small-group, and large-group practice to allow for the development of spoken fluency and presentational skills. FREN-UA 865.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Culture \u2013 Sugar, Shackles, Sabotage: The French Caribbean Suzy Cater MW, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #2743 A headless statue stands in the center of Fort-de-France, the capital of the Caribbean island of Martinique. Now decapitated and splattered in red paint, it once represented the Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon I - and daughter of sugar plantation owners in Martinique. Supposedly, Josephine encouraged Napoleon to reinstate slavery in the French colonies, after it had legally been abolished in 1794. Once reintroduced, slaves wouldn't be free again until 1848. The headless statue is one of many sites where official French history and culture is challenged - or sabotaged - by local Caribbean realities and practices. This course will explore works of Martinican and Guadeloupean literature and film which refuse to be French and insist on being Caribbean, highlighting their own history (of slavery, revolts, and maroon leaders) and their own culture (such as seen in Carnival and the language of Creole). Yet the islands have been overseas departments of France since 1946 \u2013 distant, but a part of that country \u2013 and we will examine how authors and artists negotiate this double, conflictual belonging. Its tension haunts their oeuvre, but they produce original and fascinating works which traverse oceans and borders, interrogate fixed identities, and overturn expectations about what the idea of \u201cFrench\u201d literature really means. (This course is taught in English; however, NYU French students can arrange to take the course for credit for a French major or minor. See the French Department for details.) FREN-UA 868.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Literature \u2013 The Story of My Life: Published Books, Private Lives Youna Kwak TR, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #6441 Gide, Beauvoir, Sartre, and Barthes are writers so iconic that they can be identified by just one name. Likewise The Immoralist, The Second Sex, Nausea , and Camera Lucida are among the most influential Francophone books of the 20th century. But in addition to writing well-known works of fiction and philosophy, each of these authors also wrote intimately revealing diaries and autobiographies that testify to turbulent sexual affairs, fierce social rivalries, jealousy, grief, and the horror of confronting violence and war. Which are more famous, the authors or their books? In this course we examine the fraught distinction between private lives and public books, when writers put their personal lives on display. What effect does it have on readers to think they know a writer\u2019s secrets? How does fascination with the private lives of writers inevitably influence the way we read? We will pursue our questions into the present-day, discovering contemporary authors whose blogs, memoirs, autobiographies and autofictions reflect and incite readers\u2019 desires to uncover seemingly real and authentic lives behind famous works of literature. In our so-called \u201cage of no secrets,\u201d can there be such a thing as an intimate life in print? (This course is taught in English; however, NYU   French students can arrange to take the course for credit for a French   major. See the French Department for details.) Several courses during Session II are also open to pre-college students. Incoming freshman interested in taking Elementary French I , Intensive Intermediate French , or the Topics courses should contact the Office of University Programs at &lt; university.programs@nyu.edu &gt; or at (212) 998-2292.

Congratulations on your decision  to continue studying a language spoken by over 200,000,000 people in over 50  countries around the world. Your choice  of Intermediate French is a clear sign that you are someone who wants to learn  about these people from what they say and write instead of depending upon  someone else\u2019s interpretation and that you are someone who desires direct  access to the linguistic and cultural production of these nearly  quarter-of-a-billion people to deepen your understanding of the world and all  it has to offer. We applaud your  decision!           Materials for the year:  Interaction textbook (9 th   edition)            i. Textbook            ii. On-line access to iLrn           Course and Materials Description:       This  Intermediate French I course is designed to give those of you who have mastered  the basics of French vocabulary, culture, pronunciation, and grammar the  opportunity to deepen your knowledge of the French language and the cultures  for which it is a vehicle. This class  will thus allow you even easier access to the thoughts, ideas, history, and  production of hundreds of millions of people scattered across every continent  around the globe.         The tool that we will use to explore  this language and the numerous cultures for which it is a vehicle is \u201cBravo!,\u201d  a year-long, multi-component intermediate French program that includes a  textbook and, housed on-line at the iLrn site, a workbook/lab manual, an eBook,  a video library, a battery of diagnostic tests, a companion website, and more. All the components are fully integrated, so  you should familiarize yourself with the structure of the program and all of  its parts before you embark on your linguistic adventure this semester.      Each  chapter of \u201cBravo!\u201d is designed to help you review and expand upon your  knowledge of French. Each chapter begins  with a section entitled \u201cLa grammaire \u00e0 r\u00e9viser\u201d that highlights structures  that you have seen before in Elementary French.   Take the time to look these sections over (and to work on the  corresponding exercises in the workbook) so that you can pinpoint any areas in  which you need to do some more reviewing before diving into the meat of the  chapter. You will also see that some of the  vocabulary in each lesson is presented in traditional list form, while other  vocabulary elements are grouped under the heading \u201cExpressions typiques  pour\u2026\u201d This category contains words and  phrases grouped by function, thus allowing you to move beyond isolated words  and to see how you can put together words and structures you have learned to  express culturally important and appropriate ideas, suggestions, etc.         On a final note, keep in mind that  learning a language is learning to do something (e.g., speak, read, write, and  listen), not learning about something.   Successfully learning to do something requires regular practice, not  last-minute, frantic study. You couldn\u2019t  become a good basketball player by reading about basketball every so often,  then reading a whole lot the night before a game, and then stepping out onto  the court for the first time the day of the game. The same holds true for language. To do well, you need to practice every day;  you need to train your mouth and your mind to speak and think differently. That can\u2019t be done in one all-night cram  session!                Grading:        Written Tests (4)   45%               Oral Test         10%               Oral Presentation   10%               Homework        15%               Essays (4)      10%               Participation     10%                Tests:          Tests should not be solely an indication of the average of where  you have been during the semester; they should also reflect the level of skill  and knowledge you\u2019ve achieved by the end of the course. As a result, your four tests during the  semester, all of which are cumulative, are unevenly weighted. The first test is 8% of your final grade, the  second test is 10% of your final grade, the third test is 12% of your final  grade, and the fourth test is 15% of your final grade. Not only is this a more logical distribution  of points, since you should know a lot more by the end of the semester, but it  also benefits those of you who are new to language study and might need a  little more time before everything \u201cclicks.\u201d      You  will take your written tests in class on the days indicated on this  syllabus. (NOTE: no calendar or schedule has been included  with this syllabus; dates vary from semester to semester.) Be sure you arrive a little early on test  days because each test begins with an oral comprehension section. If you arrive late, you will miss the reading  necessary for the completion of that first section. No late written tests will be administered.      The  oral test (administered during the final two weeks of the semester) takes place  in your teacher\u2019s office. The oral  diagnostic (administered in the middle of the semester) also takes place in  your teacher\u2019s office; however, while written feedback will be provided for the  oral diagnostic, the oral diagnostic itself is not graded. The oral diagnostic is simply a chance for  you to practice taking an oral exam. No  late oral tests will be administered.           Oral Presentation:       At  the end of the semester you and a partner will give a ten to twelve minute oral  presentation on some aspect of French and/or francophone culture (a place, a  person, a movement, an event, an organization, etc.). You can find information for your  presentation in the library, on line, or from interviews with French speakers,  but be sure when you give your presentation in class that your words are your  own. If you cite a source, make it very  clear that you are citing someone else\u2019s words so that you can avoid the trap  of plagiarism.                Homework:       Your  homework grade is not based on how many of your homework answers are correct,  but rather on how much effort you put into doing the work. Mistakes are an essential part of learning  anything new, including a new language\u2026there is a reason why people say, \u201cYou  learn from your mistakes.\u201d You should  think of your homework assignments as an opportunity to try to see how well you  know what you\u2019ve been studying and to pinpoint areas that you still need to  work on. Your homework grade is made up  oral and written exercises from your workbook.      The  on-line workbook/lab manual (housed at the iLrn site) contains an array of  well-designed exercises. These exercises  focus on listening, speaking, pronunciation, grammar, writing, reading, and  culture. You will notice that some of  the exercises you do can be corrected with the click of a mouse, while others  will require your teacher\u2019s input, which you will need to go back and read in  order to benefit from. You are, of  course, welcome to do additional exercises that are not marked as assigned, and  additional exercises from the on-line workbook/lab manual may be assigned by  your teacher for homework. No late homework will be accepted for credit.      Note  that while there are workbook exercises due just about every week, you never  have very many written exercises to turn in at one time. The workbook assignment schedule has been  designed in this way to help you achieve your goal (or rather, what we hope is  your goal!) to work on your French in a regular manner. Don\u2019t do the exercises assigned the night  before (or the morning!) they are due.   That vastly diminishes your chances of learning something from  them. Instead, do two or three exercises  each night. This is an easy way to check  yourself and to make sure you have a good handle on the vocabulary, culture,  and grammar being presented and discussed in class.                Essays:       You will write four essays during the course of the semester. All essays should be typed,  double-spaced. These essays are due in  class on the days indicated on the syllabus.   (NOTE: no calendar or schedule  has been included with this syllabus; dates vary from semester to semester.) No late essays will be accepted. Your teacher will provide you with the topic  for each essay at least one and a half weeks before the due date. (The first essay is to be a minimum of 200  words long, the second and third essays are to be a minimum of 250 words long,  and the final essay should be at least 300 words long.)      As  you may know by now, the best way to improve your writing skills in any  language is to take a process approach to writing, which is what we will do in  this class. When you turn in an essay,  your teacher will read it and signal the errors; however, he or she will not  provide you with the correct forms. When  you get your essay back, you will need to look over your teacher\u2019s comments and  rewrite the essay, correcting the errors your teacher has indicated and  incorporating all the changes your teacher has suggested. Your final grade for an essay will be the  average of your first grade and the grade for your rewrite. Not rewriting your essay will result in a 0  (zero) as the rewrite grade.      The  essay assignments are a chance for you to find out just what you can really do  in written French. The essays you submit  should be entirely your own work so that you can know for sure where your  strengths and weaknesses lie. You may  not ask a French-speaking friend, family member, or acquaintance to read over  and correct your essay before you turn it in \u2013 not only will you lose out on  the chance to show yourself and your teacher what you can do, but this is at  best a form of cheating, at worst plagiarism.   In addition, you may not use Internet translation programs such as  Babblefish when writing your essay.   This, too, is plagiarism. If you  do decide to use a friend or family member\u2019s help or an Internet translation program,  even if it is for only part of your essay, you will receive a 0 (zero) for your  essay. So, make everyone happy and get  the most out of your work by doing it all yourself!      You  are encouraged to use good, large dictionaries (both French-English and  French-French) while composing your essays.   Small paperback dictionaries, while often very handy in class, are  unreliable sources for this kind of written assignment. Don\u2019t forget that through the Bobst homepage  you have free access to the on-line Oxford-Hachette bilingual French-English  dictionary.                 Participation:       As  you can imagine, participation is of the utmost importance in a language  class. Your participation grade does not  depend simply on your being physically present in class. A good participation grade depends on having  all your assignments completed before class, participating (in French!) to the  best of your ability, and making a real effort to improve.      Since  participation, or \u201ctime-on-task\u201d as it is sometimes called, is so important to  your regular progress, it counts as part of your grade. It\u2019s very simple: there are no excused or unexcused absences,  there are just absences. Once you miss  four classes, you will receive a warning letter, a copy of which will also be  sent to the Director of Language Programs.   For every absence over five, one percentage point will be deducted from  your final grade.      If  you find that a serious illness or family emergency will cause you to miss many  more classes than are allowed, you should speak with your instructor and  academic counselor about the possibility of arranging for a withdrawal from the  class.

Exposes the student to  various modes, such as expressionism, social realism, and the  projection of the hero. One film is viewed per week and analyzed with  reading assignments that include novels, plays, and poems. The  objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media and to  make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these  media so often focus.      Graduate Courses  Open to Undergraduates      Courses in the Graduate  School of Arts and Science are open to seniors with a 3.5 average in  three 4-point courses (12 points) of advanced work in French. If  these courses are offered toward the requirements for the  baccalaureate degree, no advanced credit is allowed for them in the  graduate school. Before registering for these courses, students must  obtain the permission of the director of undergraduate studies.      A complete list of  graduate courses open to qualified seniors is available in the  department each semester.

SESSION I: May 26th \u2013 July 2nd FREN-UA 10 Intensive Elementary French (6 points) MTWRF, 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm Section 001 (#2510) -- Kaliane Ung / Gabriella Lindsay Section 002 (#2511) -- Tina Montenegro / Erika Hendrix This beginning-level French course is open to students with no previous training or experience in French. This intensive course is the equivalent of a year (two semesters) of regular elementary-level French. The work done throughout the session focuses on the presentation and systematic practice of the basic structures and vocabulary of oral and written French through a variety of creative activities that stress real-world contexts and communicative situations, situations that provide learners with the opportunity to develop their knowledge of French by creating, both orally and through writing, in the language. This course includes a robust online component. FREN-UA 30 Conversation &amp; Composition MTWR, 10:00am \u2013 12:00pm Melanie Hackney #2514 This fifth-semester French course is open to students who have completed one year (two semesters) of intermediate-level French (or one semester of intensive intermediate-level French). This course systematizes and reinforces language skills and functions presented in earlier courses through an intensive review of grammatical structures and usages, a variety of written activities, an introduction to composition writing, exercises and activities that promote lexical enrichment, and numerous opportunities to develop conversational and presentational skills. FREN-UA 883 (conducted in English ) Cinema and Literature Prof. William Wolf MW, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #2515 This course exposes the student to various modes, such as expressionism, social realism, and the projection of the hero. One film is viewed per week and analyzed with reading assignments that include novels, plays, and poems. The objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media and to make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these media so often focus. (Cross-listed as DRLIT-UA 504; does not count towards the requirements for the French major.)  SESSION II: July 8th \u2013 August 15th FREN-UA 1 Elementary French I Pierre Andr\u00e9 / Daniel Benson MTWR, 10:00am \u2013 12:30pm #2793 This beginning-level French course is open to students with no previous training or experience in French. The work done throughout the session focuses on the presentation and systematic practice of the initial basic structures and vocabulary of oral and written French through a variety of creative activities that stress real-world contexts and communicative situations, situations that provide learners with the opportunity to develop their knowledge of French by creating, both orally and through writing, in the language. This course includes a robust online component. FREN-UA 20 Intensive Intermediate French (6 points) MTWRF 9:00am \u2013 12:00pm Section 001 (#2512) -- Camilo Frias / Janos Kun Section 002 (#2513) -- Samantha Presnal / Lauren Weaver This intensive intermediate French course is designed to give students who have already mastered the basics of French vocabulary, culture, pronunciation, and grammar the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of the French language and the cultures for which it is a vehicle. This course not only allows students to gain even easier access to the thoughts, ideas, history, and production of hundreds of millions of French-speaking people scattered across every continent around the globe, but also prepares students to tackle advanced-level French courses. This course includes an intensive review and expansion of the most important grammatical structures through written and oral exercises and activities, the continued development of vocabulary through creative and communicative activities and projects, and extensive individual, small-group, and large-group practice to allow for the development of spoken fluency and presentational skills. FREN-UA 865.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Culture \u2013 Sugar, Shackles, Sabotage: The French Caribbean Suzy Cater MW, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #2743 A headless statue stands in the center of Fort-de-France, the capital of the Caribbean island of Martinique. Now decapitated and splattered in red paint, it once represented the Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon I - and daughter of sugar plantation owners in Martinique. Supposedly, Josephine encouraged Napoleon to reinstate slavery in the French colonies, after it had legally been abolished in 1794. Once reintroduced, slaves wouldn't be free again until 1848. The headless statue is one of many sites where official French history and culture is challenged - or sabotaged - by local Caribbean realities and practices. This course will explore works of Martinican and Guadeloupean literature and film which refuse to be French and insist on being Caribbean, highlighting their own history (of slavery, revolts, and maroon leaders) and their own culture (such as seen in Carnival and the language of Creole). Yet the islands have been overseas departments of France since 1946 \u2013 distant, but a part of that country \u2013 and we will examine how authors and artists negotiate this double, conflictual belonging. Its tension haunts their oeuvre, but they produce original and fascinating works which traverse oceans and borders, interrogate fixed identities, and overturn expectations about what the idea of \u201cFrench\u201d literature really means. (This course is taught in English; however, NYU French students can arrange to take the course for credit for a French major or minor. See the French Department for details.) FREN-UA 868.001 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Literature \u2013 The Story of My Life: Published Books, Private Lives Youna Kwak TR, 2:00pm \u2013 5:00pm #6441 Gide, Beauvoir, Sartre, and Barthes are writers so iconic that they can be identified by just one name. Likewise The Immoralist, The Second Sex, Nausea , and Camera Lucida are among the most influential Francophone books of the 20th century. But in addition to writing well-known works of fiction and philosophy, each of these authors also wrote intimately revealing diaries and autobiographies that testify to turbulent sexual affairs, fierce social rivalries, jealousy, grief, and the horror of confronting violence and war. Which are more famous, the authors or their books? In this course we examine the fraught distinction between private lives and public books, when writers put their personal lives on display. What effect does it have on readers to think they know a writer\u2019s secrets? How does fascination with the private lives of writers inevitably influence the way we read? We will pursue our questions into the present-day, discovering contemporary authors whose blogs, memoirs, autobiographies and autofictions reflect and incite readers\u2019 desires to uncover seemingly real and authentic lives behind famous works of literature. In our so-called \u201cage of no secrets,\u201d can there be such a thing as an intimate life in print? (This course is taught in English; however, NYU   French students can arrange to take the course for credit for a French   major. See the French Department for details.) Several courses during Session II are also open to pre-college students.

Congratulations on your decision  to continue studying a language spoken by over 200,000,000 people in over 50  countries around the world. Your choice  of Intermediate French is a clear sign that you are someone who wants to learn  about these people from what they say and write instead of depending upon  someone else\u2019s interpretation and that you are someone who desires direct  access to the linguistic and cultural production of these nearly  quarter-of-a-billion people to deepen your understanding of the world and all  it has to offer. We applaud your  decision!           Materials for the year:  Interaction textbook (9 th   edition)            i. Textbook            ii. On-line access to iLrn           Course and Materials Description:       This  Intermediate French I course is designed to give those of you who have mastered  the basics of French vocabulary, culture, pronunciation, and grammar the  opportunity to deepen your knowledge of the French language and the cultures  for which it is a vehicle. This class  will thus allow you even easier access to the thoughts, ideas, history, and  production of hundreds of millions of people scattered across every continent  around the globe.         The tool that we will use to explore  this language and the numerous cultures for which it is a vehicle is \u201cBravo!,\u201d  a year-long, multi-component intermediate French program that includes a  textbook and, housed on-line at the iLrn site, a workbook/lab manual, an eBook,  a video library, a battery of diagnostic tests, a companion website, and more. All the components are fully integrated, so  you should familiarize yourself with the structure of the program and all of  its parts before you embark on your linguistic adventure this semester.      Each  chapter of \u201cBravo!\u201d is designed to help you review and expand upon your  knowledge of French. Each chapter begins  with a section entitled \u201cLa grammaire \u00e0 r\u00e9viser\u201d that highlights structures  that you have seen before in Elementary French.   Take the time to look these sections over (and to work on the  corresponding exercises in the workbook) so that you can pinpoint any areas in  which you need to do some more reviewing before diving into the meat of the  chapter. You will also see that some of the  vocabulary in each lesson is presented in traditional list form, while other  vocabulary elements are grouped under the heading \u201cExpressions typiques  pour\u2026\u201d This category contains words and  phrases grouped by function, thus allowing you to move beyond isolated words  and to see how you can put together words and structures you have learned to  express culturally important and appropriate ideas, suggestions, etc.         On a final note, keep in mind that  learning a language is learning to do something (e.g., speak, read, write, and  listen), not learning about something.   Successfully learning to do something requires regular practice, not  last-minute, frantic study. You couldn\u2019t  become a good basketball player by reading about basketball every so often,  then reading a whole lot the night before a game, and then stepping out onto  the court for the first time the day of the game. The same holds true for language. To do well, you need to practice every day;  you need to train your mouth and your mind to speak and think differently. That can\u2019t be done in one all-night cram  session!                Grading:        Written Tests (4)   45%               Oral Test         10%               Oral Presentation   10%               Homework        15%               Essays (4)      10%               Participation     10%                Tests:          Tests should not be solely an indication of the average of where  you have been during the semester; they should also reflect the level of skill  and knowledge you\u2019ve achieved by the end of the course. As a result, your four tests during the  semester, all of which are cumulative, are unevenly weighted. The first test is 8% of your final grade, the  second test is 10% of your final grade, the third test is 12% of your final  grade, and the fourth test is 15% of your final grade. Not only is this a more logical distribution  of points, since you should know a lot more by the end of the semester, but it  also benefits those of you who are new to language study and might need a  little more time before everything \u201cclicks.\u201d      You  will take your written tests in class on the days indicated on this  syllabus. (NOTE: no calendar or schedule has been included  with this syllabus; dates vary from semester to semester.) Be sure you arrive a little early on test  days because each test begins with an oral comprehension section. If you arrive late, you will miss the reading  necessary for the completion of that first section. No late written tests will be administered.      The  oral test (administered during the final two weeks of the semester) takes place  in your teacher\u2019s office. The oral  diagnostic (administered in the middle of the semester) also takes place in  your teacher\u2019s office; however, while written feedback will be provided for the  oral diagnostic, the oral diagnostic itself is not graded. The oral diagnostic is simply a chance for  you to practice taking an oral exam. No  late oral tests will be administered.           Oral Presentation:       At  the end of the semester you and a partner will give a ten to twelve minute oral  presentation on some aspect of French and/or francophone culture (a place, a  person, a movement, an event, an organization, etc.). You can find information for your  presentation in the library, on line, or from interviews with French speakers,  but be sure when you give your presentation in class that your words are your  own. If you cite a source, make it very  clear that you are citing someone else\u2019s words so that you can avoid the trap  of plagiarism.                Homework:       Your  homework grade is not based on how many of your homework answers are correct,  but rather on how much effort you put into doing the work. Mistakes are an essential part of learning  anything new, including a new language\u2026there is a reason why people say, \u201cYou  learn from your mistakes.\u201d You should  think of your homework assignments as an opportunity to try to see how well you  know what you\u2019ve been studying and to pinpoint areas that you still need to  work on. Your homework grade is made up  oral and written exercises from your workbook.      The  on-line workbook/lab manual (housed at the iLrn site) contains an array of  well-designed exercises. These exercises  focus on listening, speaking, pronunciation, grammar, writing, reading, and  culture. You will notice that some of  the exercises you do can be corrected with the click of a mouse, while others  will require your teacher\u2019s input, which you will need to go back and read in  order to benefit from. You are, of  course, welcome to do additional exercises that are not marked as assigned, and  additional exercises from the on-line workbook/lab manual may be assigned by  your teacher for homework. No late homework will be accepted for credit.      Note  that while there are workbook exercises due just about every week, you never  have very many written exercises to turn in at one time. The workbook assignment schedule has been  designed in this way to help you achieve your goal (or rather, what we hope is  your goal!) to work on your French in a regular manner. Don\u2019t do the exercises assigned the night  before (or the morning!) they are due.   That vastly diminishes your chances of learning something from  them. Instead, do two or three exercises  each night. This is an easy way to check  yourself and to make sure you have a good handle on the vocabulary, culture,  and grammar being presented and discussed in class.                Essays:       You will write four essays during the course of the semester. All essays should be typed,  double-spaced. These essays are due in  class on the days indicated on the syllabus.   (NOTE: no calendar or schedule  has been included with this syllabus; dates vary from semester to semester.) No late essays will be accepted. Your teacher will provide you with the topic  for each essay at least one and a half weeks before the due date. (The first essay is to be a minimum of 200  words long, the second and third essays are to be a minimum of 250 words long,  and the final essay should be at least 300 words long.)      As  you may know by now, the best way to improve your writing skills in any  language is to take a process approach to writing, which is what we will do in  this class. When you turn in an essay,  your teacher will read it and signal the errors; however, he or she will not  provide you with the correct forms. When  you get your essay back, you will need to look over your teacher\u2019s comments and  rewrite the essay, correcting the errors your teacher has indicated and  incorporating all the changes your teacher has suggested. Your final grade for an essay will be the  average of your first grade and the grade for your rewrite. Not rewriting your essay will result in a 0  (zero) as the rewrite grade.      The  essay assignments are a chance for you to find out just what you can really do  in written French. The essays you submit  should be entirely your own work so that you can know for sure where your  strengths and weaknesses lie. You may  not ask a French-speaking friend, family member, or acquaintance to read over  and correct your essay before you turn it in \u2013 not only will you lose out on  the chance to show yourself and your teacher what you can do, but this is at  best a form of cheating, at worst plagiarism.   In addition, you may not use Internet translation programs such as  Babblefish when writing your essay.   This, too, is plagiarism. If you  do decide to use a friend or family member\u2019s help or an Internet translation program,  even if it is for only part of your essay, you will receive a 0 (zero) for your  essay. So, make everyone happy and get  the most out of your work by doing it all yourself!      You  are encouraged to use good, large dictionaries (both French-English and  French-French) while composing your essays.   Small paperback dictionaries, while often very handy in class, are  unreliable sources for this kind of written assignment. Don\u2019t forget that through the Bobst homepage  you have free access to the on-line Oxford-Hachette bilingual French-English  dictionary.                 Participation:       As  you can imagine, participation is of the utmost importance in a language  class. Your participation grade does not  depend simply on your being physically present in class. A good participation grade depends on having  all your assignments completed before class, participating (in French!) to the  best of your ability, and making a real effort to improve.      Since  participation, or \u201ctime-on-task\u201d as it is sometimes called, is so important to  your regular progress, it counts as part of your grade. It\u2019s very simple: there are no excused or unexcused absences,  there are just absences. Once you miss  four classes, you will receive a warning letter, a copy of which will also be  sent to the Director of Language Programs.   For every absence over five, one percentage point will be deducted from  your final grade.      If  you find that a serious illness or family emergency will cause you to miss many  more classes than are allowed, you should speak with your instructor and  academic counselor about the possibility of arranging for a withdrawal from the  class.
