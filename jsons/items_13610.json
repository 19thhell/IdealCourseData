The  emphasis of the course is on practical application and the development of sound  instruction skills, with attention to empirical justification for  methodological choices drawn from research. The course is designed to acquaint  the student with a broad range of background skills, activity formats and media  that can be used to enhance the proficiency-oriented teaching/learning  experience at the university level. The seminar format requires that all  students contribute to classroom discussions. Outside reading is therefore  criticalto successful performance in the course.      This  is a zero credit, Pass/Fail course. All PhD and MFA students teaching in the  language program for the first time are required to enroll.            SPAN-GA 2965.001      Title: Seminar in  Theory: Sense-Making   Instructor: Gabriela Basterra   Day/Time: Tuesday, 2-4pm   Description:      Narrative  creates the illusion of coherence and unity by arranging experience as  meaningful action in time through the invention of a work of synthesis, the  plot. This seminar studies the ways in  which contemporary narratives help us to make sense of the world and imagine a  significance for ourselves. By relating us to a beginning and to an end,  narrative is said to provide a sense of place, time and finality that  contributes to creating the illusion of belonging in the world. To narrate the past is, as Paul Ricoeur  remarks, to recollect a horizon of possibilities that gives impulse and  significance to our projections into the future. But the promise of action that narrative  contains is not always easy to discern.    If, for example, events are selected and arranged from the viewpoint of  the character\u2019s death, obliterating duration and process, those events may only  become intelligible in light of a predetermining fate. What happens, for example, when modern  narratives of subjectivity ultimately kill the lived experience they seek to  organize by requiring the self to identify with universals? How do particular modes of emplotment  fruitfully work towards creating the \u201cnecessary fictions\u201d that constitute us as  subjects?        Other  questions: what is the relation between narrative and referent, identity,  history, memory, intelligibility, time?    Do narrative roads not taken constitute historical possibilities left  uninvented, unexplored? Would the human  capacity for action be enlarged by the ability to envision \u201cvirtual histories\u201d  and imagine the \u201cwhat if\u2026?\u201d When  narrative closure is postponed or suspended, is sense suspended, too? Why are narratives of failure so  seductive? What happens when a  particular experience becomes unavailable to language? How does a trauma acquire the status of cause  in psychoanalytic narrations? How do we  confront narratives that frustrate our expectations or that resist  interpretation altogether, placing themselves beyond our reach? At the forefront of our inquiry will be the  role negation plays in creating objects for thought.      Essays  by Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Emmanuel Levinas, Louis  Althusser, Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Paul Ricoeur, Gilles Deleuze,  Maurice Blanchot, Raymond Williams, Barbara Johnson, Hayden White, Adriana  Cavarero, Fernando Savater, Gillian Rose, Ernesto Laclau, Elaine Scarry, Nial  Ferguson, Samir Amin. Narrative  readings may include works by Laurence Sterne, Machado de Assis, Franz Kafka,  Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, Samuel Beckett, Robert Antelme, Luis Bu\u00f1uel,  Fernando Arrabal, Juan Goytisolo, Jos\u00e9 Saramago, Ant\u00f3nio Lobos Antunes, Carme  Riera, Ana Mar\u00eda Moix, Javier Tomeo, Juan Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1s, Enrique Vila-Mata,  Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez Cubas, Almudena Grandes, Orson Welles.      Conducted  in English        SPAN-GA 2966.001  (Same as FINH-GA 3044.001)    Title : Ephemera,  Frivolity, and the Inconsequential: Mass Culture and the Avant-garde      Instructor : Jordana Mendelson      Day/Time : Monday, 4-6pm       Description : From the  late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth, artists and writers engaged in  rich, multi-layered and often contradictory positions in relation to the rise  of mass culture. In this seminar, we will look at mass culture as a  multi-dimensional sphere in which objects, papers, spaces and screens displayed  the growing array of ideas and images that were produced, purchased, and  exchanged. Rather than think hierarchically about the divisions between  producers/consumers, factory/salon, \u00e9lite/masse, we will try to push into the  contact/clash zones that brought the struggles around economic modernity into  dialogue with the spectacles, pleasures, and fantasies of mass culture.  Although the political dimension of mass culture (especially as it relates to  techniques of display and distribution) is important to the work we will be  doing over the semester, the purpose of this seminar will be to focus on  commerce itself as a category in the work of avant-garde writers, artists, and  film makers. We will be working across an international bibliography of  theoretical texts and examples of artists and writers who either participated  directly in the creation of mass cultural artifacts or were avid  consumers/commentators of them.      Students  should contact Professor Mendelson with questions in advance of enrolling in  the seminar. Students will be expected to take on a heavy load of reading and  research and produce, by the end of the semester a finished piece of written  scholarship, which may be a state-of-the field paper and bibliography or an  original piece of writing based on archival/museum research. For those students  in MFA programs, who are interested in enrolling, they are welcome but should  think ahead about the kind of project they will need to complete by the end of  the term.      Incompletes  will not be granted, except in the case of a medial or family emergency.            SPAN-GA 2967.001            Title: Macuna\u00edma: Mito y Literatura      Instructor : Eduardo Subirats      Day/Time : Monday, 6-8pm            Description : Este seminario es la continuaci\u00f3n de una serie, comenzada en 2005, que  ha estado dedicada monogr\u00e1ficamente a la reconstrucci\u00f3n exhaustiva de novelas  can\u00f3nicas latinoamericanas desde una perspectiva mito-po\u00e9tica y \u201crom\u00e1ntica.\u201d  Hemos trabajado en este sentido a Pedro  P\u00e1ramo , Yo, El Supremo y Los r\u00edos profundos . Y seguire con Grande Sert\u00e3o de Guimar\u00e3es Rosa. Les  recuerdo algunos de los t\u00f3picos dominantes en estos seminarios: las diosas  precoloniales en la novela de Rulfo, la cr\u00edtica de la gramatologia derridiana  en Rama y Roa Bastos, el concepto de mimesis sagrada en la micropo\u00e9tica de  Arguedas. Como en sus versiones anteriores, este seminario sobre la novela de  M\u00e1rio de Andrade expondr\u00e1 sus momentos est\u00e9ticos, sociales y filos\u00f3ficos.  Cuatro son los puntos focales de este seminario: 1) las cosmolog\u00edas ind\u00edgenas;  2) el trickster y el clown en las tradiciones amerindias; e) el estudio cl\u00e1sico  sobre el trickster y su relaci\u00f3n con Hermes de Carl Ker\u00e9nyi, y el desarrollo  humanista de este t\u00f3pico en Thomas Mann; y c) el concepto filos\u00f3fico de  metamorfosis a partir de las cosmolog\u00edas amaz\u00f3nicas con un discusi\u00f3n en torno a  Ovidio y Pit\u00e1goras.                  SPAN-GA 2968.001            Title: Trance, Rapture, Ecstasy      Instructor: Dylon Robbins      Day/Time : Tuesday, 4-6pm       Description : In this course, we  will examine and discuss different \u201cinterruptions\u201d of consciousness and their  related sociabilities. The paradigms of trance, rapture, and ecstasy will  be invoked in our analysis of collective dancing manias, religious mysticism  and messianic movements, improvised music practices, texts authored by spirit  mediums, as well tendencies in ethnographic filmmaking. We will also  examine some of the pathologizations of these and related activities through a  discussion of syncope, paroxysm, onanism, and hysteria. The course seeks  to dialogue with contemporary theoretical discussions involving critiques of  populism as well as hauntology, the political economy of specters and zombies,  and the ambivalent valences of play. The seminar will be conducted in  English. Some of the readings will also be in Portuguese, Spanish, and  French, but generally translations will be made available.                  SPAN-GA 2975.001  (Same as COLIT-GA 2978.001)             Title: The End of Cervantes      Instructor: Jacques Lezra      Day/Time : Wednesday, 4-6pm       Description :      We  will study three related problems. How do concepts of \"end\"--as  a historical and as an analytic concept; ending, telos, conclusion...--work in  Cervantes's texts? What counts as a \"decision\" in Cervantes?   (Who decides what, under what conditions, with what consequences,  according to what rules...) And: in what ways does Cervantes's reflection  on \"ends\" provide a critique of disciplinarity, including  philology? Readings will include (some of) Cervantes's theatre and prose;  Schmitt, Luhmann, Maturana, Latour, Deleuze; essays on decidability and  completeness.                    SPAN-GA 2977.001          Title : Comparatism, Contingency, and the Caribbean  Instructor : Ana Dopico  Day/Time : Tuesday, 12:30-3:15pm  (This course originates in Comparative Literature)  \u201cThe  Caribbean,\u201d as David Scott has argued, \u201cis not merely modern\u2026. it is modern in  a fundamentally inaugural way.\u201d What does it mean to think of the Caribbean as  an inaugural imaginary? And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host  of thinkers, writers and artists of the nineteenth and twentieth century have  insisted on the centrality of the Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding  of modernity and its elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire,  sovereignty and simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or  tragically, revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think  beyond the dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation,  archipelago and diaspora. This demands too that we read beyond the  tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor forms and  minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic and  theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and contingencies  within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It requires the  capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and simultaneously engage  the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency, misunderstanding, as  well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of domination, transaction and  subordination.          This  course considers key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads  them comparatively and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional  and postcolonial inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and  lesser-known expressions, major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten  forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments of the Caribbean  have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments, insurgent movements  and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of literature to the  epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural practices, aiming  both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for  example, have we come to understand the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban  Revolution within grand narratives and what would it mean to read in them not  epic, tragic destinies but more banal parables about modernity \u2014destinies  consonant with other forms of communal politics, other orders of transaction  and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from Berlin to Grenada? Comparative  questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of revolution  and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the specificity  of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of literature  and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature compete with  visual aesthetics? How do we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or  desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy  the postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like Franz Kafka?      We  will also ask about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the  reparative poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We  will engage the divisions between Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone  Caribbean studies and trace cultural and theoretical genealogies and  segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a common culture beyond the major  tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars have used to bind literary  production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What  is the place of the Caribbean in the conceptions and political destinies of the  American hemisphere or the Global South?      The  syllabus is still in progress but will include selections from major canonical  Caribbean texts (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach,  Marinello, Ortiz, Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming), theorists  and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant, Moreno Fraginals,  Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature  (Carpentier, Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through  to the post-colonial Caribbean Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers  from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We will consider the formation  of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques ,  to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic and activist  interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual practices in the  academy.

The  syllabus is still in progress but will include selections from major canonical  Caribbean texts (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach,  Marinello, Ortiz, Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming), theorists  and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant, Moreno Fraginals,  Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature  (Carpentier, Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through  to the post-colonial Caribbean Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers  from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We will consider the formation  of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques ,  to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic and activist  interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual practices in the  academy.

The course is designed for students who want to perfect their Spanish as they expand their knowledge regarding literature, cinema, and social and political problems that exist today within modern Argentine society. The reading of different dramatic texts and viewing of various films throughout the semester will serve to expand lexicon, strengthen grammar and improve the student's style. The objective of this course is that the students familiarize themselves with everyday language of current newspapers and magazines, at the same time as they enter into the world of Spanish literature.   The most important goal of the course is to offer a methodologically simple approximation that helps the student to develop a greater verbal and communicative dexterity. To this end, every week the students will analyze and debate the cultural and literary content texts that are to be studied and every two weeks the students will present a written composition of the topics covered in class. In the classroom linguistic correction will be emphasized along with auditory practice through the use of a wide range of materials and resources: theoretical explanations, comprehension and vocabulary exercises, film viewing, as well as exercises that highlight certain morphological aspects or grammatical usage of Spanish.

Through the analysis of artistic images of Mexico , Peru, Brazil and Argentina, will discuss the role of visual representation in the process of conquest and colonization of the territory in Latin America, and later in the construction and consolidation of national states and regional identities. With the alternation of guided visits to museums in Buenos Aires and classes, students will have the opportunity to learn about artistic languages \u200b\u200b, techniques , iconography , production systems , and some aspects of Latin American history .

Mitos, \u00edconos y tradiciones inventadas is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the rich and complex history of Latin America through the study of some of its most known and iconic cultural expressions. It does also work as an introductory map to the most influential and widespread approaches in Latin American social sciences, cultural studies and literary criticism. Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.

When Taught in Spanish, Prerequisite of Advanced Spanish language skills required. (NYU SPAN-UA 100 Advanced Grammar &amp; Composition or equivalent.)   The objective of the course is to analyze the social, cultural and political transformations experienced in Argentina during the XX century. The scheduled activities are divided into theory-practice classes and cultural visits. There are required readings for the classes which are usually based in a general bibliography that will give the student a factual context of each unit. Ideas exchange will take place, so the students should read the material in advance in order to continue with the course. The objective of cultural activities is to link the students with the material dimension of history, putting themselves in contact with crucial clues for its comprehension.

La lengua de Buenos Aires is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the most outstanding features of the Spanish of the Rio de la Plata area. It does also work as an introductory map to the main problems and questions of the culture of the city of Buenos Aires. Through a lively discussion of current cultural conflicts in politics, literature, music, drama and film, the course will enhance the listening and reading abilities of the students, while improving their speaking and writing proficiency in Spanish. These said conflicts and their transformations are key to an understanding of the way porte\u00f1os speak and think. From a first section devoted to political discourse, we will move onto a consideration of its rhetorical precedents in argentine literature. This will give us the critical tools we need to further our inquiries in other fields such as rock, drama, journalism and film.

The course is designed to introduce students to the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Through reading, analysis, and discussion of short fiction or poems and critical bibliography, the students will examine the dichotomy civilization-barbarism in Borges works (in connection to the Argentine cultural tradition since nineteenth century); some key topics in his texts such as tigers, labyrinths and libraries; the relationship between writing and translation (specifically in the English translations of his fictions); the political aspects of the literature produced by Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers on Eva Per\u00f3n. The course will also develop the connections between Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers.

This course deals with themes of culture, cultural identity and the politics of culture and identity, with reference to five specific Latin American cases: a). Indigenous communities of the Amazon (Achuar) and the Pampas-Patagonia region (Mapuche, Rank\u00fclche); b) Andean peasants (Aymaras) and indigenous proletariat of the Chaco (Toba); c). working class and ethnic neighborhoods of the city. By means of this empirical survey we hope to illustrate and discuss the some of the different ideas that have come to the fore in recent debates about \u201cculture,\u201d including essentialism and constructivism; rethinking of the nature/culture dichotomy; and the idea of cultural identity as a right, as a strategy of domination or as a form of resistance, etc.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Fotograf\u00eda y literatura en Am\u00e9rica Latina - SPAN-UA 9550 - 4 points                               Este curso se pregunta qu\u00e9 es y c\u00f3mo se lee una fotograf\u00eda.

Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now.

Prerequisites: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), or Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5) or equivalents.   There are two parts to this course. In the first part of the course we will study two of the main financial asset markets: bond markets and stock markets. We will study the concept and determination of interest rates; the risk structure and the term structure of interest rates; stock pricing and the efficient markets hypothesis; cross-border arbitrage. We will also analyze financial structure in Argentina and other Latin American banks.   In the second part of the course we will study the monetary and financial system. We will study how money is created, the tools of monetary policy, the commercial banking industry and its links to monetary policy and the Central Bank, and how monetary policy affects the economy in general. In this part we will also analyze how market failures (such as information asymmetries) and distortionary policies (such as financial repression) may hinder the contribution of financial markets and monetary policy to macroeconomic stability. The roles of state-owned banks in Latin American economies will also be discussed.

Two sections, one in each city, will meet and collaborate simultaneously via internet to address several key questions: How are art and politics understood and expressed differently and similarly in these two American metropolises and why? How do shared aesthetic features of public art reflect the global circulation of urban creative modes? What do we learn about local politics from looking at the art and writing on a city\u2019s public spaces? Teams of students in both cities will conduct field work in selected neighborhoods to help create an archive of murals, graffiti, performances, and installations. Then, drawing from readings in history, art criticism, and urban studies, as well as from census and electoral data and using GIS technology, we will analyze how social and political processes like gentrification, inequality, and planning generate and reflect creative political expression as captured in our database, culminating in transnational, collaborative projects that explore what wisdom and truths America's streets continue to reveal, 500 years after conquest.

This course requires a 90-minute weekly seminar and a minimum of 10 hours fieldwork a week at an approved internship field site. The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Argentine Civil Society. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency. The course provides you with tools to analyze your organization\u2019s approach, its policies, its programs, and the political, legal, social, economic and cultural contexts in which it operates. Guest-speakers are invited to the seminar and case studies on Argentina civil society are discussed.&amp;nbsp; You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

Advanced Spanish skills (beyond Intermediate II) recommended.   This course combines a seminar based weekly section together with intensive internships in businesses, NGOs or other organizations. The experiential part will consist of 10 weekly hours of work within a pre-arranged organization. The academic part is meant to assist students in getting the most from this experience and provide theoretical and methodological elements to critically examine their experiences. It weaves together research design and methods with an empirical and theoretical examination of recent social phenomena in Argentina. We will use selected themes and topics to explore theoretical perspectives and selected aspects of contemporary Argentine society. In parallel we will explore how to construct a research project, collect data and analyze its contents.

It is intimately related to public health and policy making, as it provides elemental \u201cinformation for action\u201d. This course is designed to introduce students to the history, basic principles and methods of epidemiology.     Topics covered in this course are history, background and different perspectives of epidemiology, measures of disease frequency; measures of association; epidemiologic study designs; public health surveillance; outbreak investigations; assessment of causality; and relationship between epidemiology and public health policies. In addition, students are expected to develop skills to critically read, interpret and evaluate health information from published epidemiological studies and mass media sources.

This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.

There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the \u201ctelenovela\u201d is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.

Covering in parallel the evolution of the international system and the changing position of the region in that same system, the course attempts to reinterpret the frameworks of analysis as perceived from the Western Hemisphere. The student will be provided with a Latin American view of the main economic developments and political processes that have given shape to each stage in time- to the structure and dynamics of the international system. The ultimate goal is to make students aware that where you stand depends on where you sit by exposing them to alternate views on concepts they are already familiar with.
