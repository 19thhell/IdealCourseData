The design of the curriculum aims at providing students with an advanced, but balanced biological education that prepares them to understand and apply to their research sophisticated ideas and methodologies of biochemistry, genetics, immunology, and molecular cell biology. There are no course requirements; rather each student decides with his or her mentor plus a student advisor which courses are most appropriate for that student's interests. Students must meet with their thesis committee at least once, but preferably twice, a year.   In addition to specific courses, the program also provides a number of venues for individual students to design their own learning, and to discuss their research. These include:   Tutorials with individual faculty selected by the students.   Presentations of research progress in weekly meetings with colleagues.   The selection by students of outside guest seminar speakers.   Participation in a student run journal club.   A student poster day where students present and discuss their research in an informal atmosphere.   To encourage new students to broaden their scientific knowledge, the program offers to each entering student a financial contribution to offset the cost of attendance at a course or meeting of the student's choice.

The Carlton lab uses the tools of comparative genomics (bioinformatics, genomics, molecular evolution, and population genetics) to compare the genomes of related species of protist, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium, and species of trichomonad such as the sexually-transmitted pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis. Our ultimate goal is to reveal the biological mechanisms that parasites use to interact with their hosts, and identify characteristics that can be exploited to develop better methods of control, e.g. drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and surveillance tools.

Email: kcg1@nyu.edu   Research Interests: Developmental systems biology. Our laboratory is interested in the integrative analysis of diverse functional genomics data to identify groups of genes that work in specific cellular and developmental processes. We use integrative approaches to analyze and interpret large-scale datasets and to generate testable hypotheses on gene function in different biological systems, including C. elegans and mouse early embryogenesis.

Email: edo.kussell@nyu.edu   Research Interests: Computational biology, evolution, and biological physics We work on problems at the interface of biology and physics, with emphasis on populations, evolution, and stochastic dynamics. We combine theoretical biophysical approaches with experiments and bioinformatics to explore systems that exhibit complex, population-level phenomena.

Email: fp1@nyu.edu   Research Interests: Genomics, genetics and evolution of early C. elegans development. We study the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms underlying early embryonic development using a combination of molecular genetic and functional genomics approaches in the animal model C. elegans and related nematodes.

Email: mp132@nyu.edu   Research Interests: Plant Evolutionary Genomics We study the evolutionary and ecological genomics of adaptation and species diversification. We focus most of our work on plants (including Arabidopsis and domesticated crops such as rice), although we also investigate other systems, including social evolution in Dictysotelium. Our approach is to integrate perspectives from a wide range of disciplines, including population genomics, systems biology, developmental genetics, landscape ecology, and even archaeology.

Email: mrockman@nyu.edu   Research Interests: Evolutionary and molecular causes of heritable variation in animals Our goal is to understand the relationship between the molecular mechanisms that shape phenotypes within individuals and the evolutionary mechanisms that generate and maintain phenotypic variation within populations. This project requires that we identify the functional allelic variants that segregate in nature, understand their molecular mechanisms, characterize their population genetic dynamics, and build models that explain these dynamics in terms of molecular biology and ecology.

(Statistics) 2010, Oxford University; B.Sc (Biology) 2006, Duke University   Email: rahul.satija@nyu.edu   Research Interests: Single cell genomics, transcriptional regulation, computational biology Our goal is to understand how cellular heterogeneity encodes the molecular structure, function, and regulation of complex biological systems. We combine single cell genomics with tailored computational methods to study how cells work together to drive biological processes and behaviors.

Email: mark.siegal@nyu.edu   Research Interests: evolutionary systems biology; robustness and evolution of complex traits Our aim is to understand the evolution of complex traits, by studying the gene-regulatory networks that underlie them. Our work uses two major model organisms (flies and yeast) as well as computational analyses.
