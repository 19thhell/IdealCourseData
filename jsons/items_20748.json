After graduation, I spent six years as a    systems programmer designing operating systems for computers and, then entered    the doctoral program in Psychology at Stanford. While I was there I was also able    to take graduate courses in statistics in several departments, leading to an M.S.    in Mathematical Statistics and a minor in Electrical Engineering.     At Stanford I studied color vision with Brian Wandell, issues of    representation and measurement with Amos Tversky, and signal detection theory and    statistical modeling with Ewart A. C. Thomas. My doctoral dissertation concerned    surface color perception and color constancy. After a brief stay as an Associate    at NASA-Ames, I spent three years at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor as an    assistant professor and then moved to join the vision group at New York    University, where I remain.     My central research interest is the comparison of human performance to models    of performance based on mathematical statistics, physics and    mathematics.         back to the top     Awards [partial list]         \u2022 Humboldt Research Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany, 2008     \u2022 Troland Research Award of the National Academy of Sciences, 1987.     \u2022 Fulbright Scholar Award, Hungary, 2014-2015.     \u2022 Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science, selected 2012.     \u2022 Fellow, Society for Experimental Psychology, elected 2009.     \u2022 Fellow, Association for Psychological Science, elected 2011.     \u2022 Fellow, Zentrum f\u00fcr interdisziplin\u00e4re Forschung, Bielefeld, Germany, 1995-96.     \u2022 Forchheimer Professor, Computer Science, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 1999.     \u2022 WICN Visiting Scholar, Wales Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Bangor University, Bangor, Wales, 2008.     \u2022 Golden Dozen Teaching Award, New York University, 1994.                 back to the top         Publications     Recent Publications             2014-2015 and in press         Zhang, H., Paily, J.

Reliable estimation of surface properties    analogous to color is a difficult if not impossible computational problem in such    limited scenes (Maloney, 1999). In more realistic, three-dimensional scenes the    problem is difficult but not intractable, in part because considerable    information about the spatial and spectral distribution of the illumination is    usually available in the form of cues to the illuminant. We are engaged in a    series of experiments that examine whether the human visual system discounts the    spatial and spectral distribution of the illumination in judging matte surface    lightness and color and what illuminant cues the visual system uses in estimating    the flow of light in a scene.          The stimulus above is a binocular pair, with the right eye image repeated in the    order Right-Left-Right. You can fuse the two images on the left with eyes crossed    ('crossed fusion') or the two images on the right with eyes uncrossed ('uncrossed    fusion'). The scene is taken from a recent experiment where we examine perception    of color in computer-generated scenes with two yellow punctate sources ('suns')    and a blue diffuse sky. The punctate sources are behind the observer, not    directly visible. The observer's task is to set the central rectangular patch to    be neither blue nor yellow and neither red nor green (i.e. grey, neutral,    colorless). This task is called an achromatic matching task. It allows us to    assess whether the observer can work out how the light sources in the scene are    arranged and successfully perceive stable surface colors in simulated    environments with two suns in the sky (yes, they can do it!).

[ pdf ]     back to the top          Movement Planning under Risk          We are investigating speeded movement tasks that are equivalent to decision    making under risk. In these tasks subjects attempt to touch reward regions on a    display screen and avoid nearby penalty regions, much as a golfer aims to reach    the green while avoiding nearby sand traps. The subject is required to complete    the movement within a short time and, like the golfer, cannot completely control    the outcome of the action. We are interested in whether the subject takes his or    her own movement uncertainty into account in planning movements. We record    subjects' hand and arm movements in three dimensions with an Optotrak 3020 motion    tracking device or a Polhemus HST-16 electromagnetic tracker. These tasks form a    promising alternative domain in which to study decision making and they are    distinguished by the fact that the uncertainties surrounding possible outcomes    are intrinsic to the motor system.     The papers by Trommersh\u00e4user, Maloney &amp; Landy (2003) report our first    attempts while the review chapter by Maloney, Trommersh\u00e4user &amp; Landy (2006)    focuses on connections to decision making. We are actively investigating how the    motor system compensates for its own uncertainty in planning movements as well as    studying decision making in a new modality.     In ongoing experiments, we are also looking at how information flows from the    visual system to the motor system and how flexible motor planning can be in a    rapidly changing environment. We are also looking at how partial information    (encoded as a statistical prior distribution) influences movement planning and    how rapidly the motor system recovers when we restrict its freedom of movement.    We hope that this last series of experiments will tell us more about recovery    from stroke and injury.     Hudson, T. E., Maloney, L. T. &amp; Landy, M. S.

[pdf]         back to the top          Material Perception     We are studying how human observers estimate surface properties such as    roughness, glossiness, transparency, and refractive index.     In Ho, Landy and Maloney (2006, in press), we examined visual estimation of    surface roughness using random computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) surfaces    rendered under a mixture of diffuse lighting and a punctate source. You can see    some examples below. The surfaces increase in physical roughness from left to    right. The different rows correspond to different lighting conditions.          We estimated how perceived roughness varied with the direction of illumination. A    'roughness constant'\u009d observer would make estimates of surface roughness that did    not vary at all with changes in illumination direction and we assessed how close    human observers came to this ideal. The angle between the tangent to the plane    containing the surface texture and the direction to the punctate source was    varied from 50 to 70 degrees across lighting conditions. Observers were presented    with pairs of surfaces under different lighting conditions and indicated which 3D    surface appeared rougher.     All observers perceived surfaces to be markedly rougher with decreasing    illuminant angle (going from the bottom to the top row above). We identified four    novel cues that are valid cues to roughness under any single lighting condition    but that are not invariant under changes in lighting condition. We modeled    observers' deviations from roughness constancy as a weighted linear combination    of these 'pseudo-cues' and found that they account for a substantial amount of    observers' systematic deviations from roughness constancy with changes in    lighting condition.     These novel cues are not valid cues to roughness when lighting changes. The    surfaces outlined in red in the figure above all have the same physical roughness    but different degrees of shadows, etc. However, these same cues would be valid    cues to roughness within a single lighting condition (blue rectangle).    Consequently, these pseudo-cues may be the result of cue learning in one context    (illumination invariant) incorrectly generalized to a different context    (illumination changing). With Yun-Xian Ho and Michael Landy.          In another study (Fulvio, Singh, Maloney, 2006), we investigated how achromatic    and chromatic cues interact to produce transparency. Observers were shown    six-region stimulus displays (shown above) that either varied in lightness (left)    or color (right). They made adjustments of the color and luminance attributes of    one of the filter regions to achieve the best percept of transparency. The    Metelli-D'Zmura conditions for transparency are diagrammed in the center above.    However, we were interested primarily not in the mean settings made bit in setting reliability , the reciprocal of setting variance. We wished to    determine whether the combination of chromatic and achromatic information leads    to enhanced reliability of perceived transparency. We compared their settings in    luminance only conditions (above left) and color only conditions (above right) C to their color settings when we superimposed the two    patterns.. Color adjustments were more reliable when accompanied by luminance    information, but surprisingly not vice versa. With Jacqueline Fulvio and Manish    Singh.          Recently, we started looking at perceptual scaling of refractive index of    transparent materials (how much the material bends light passing through it).    Show above are two 'pebbles' of the same thickness but different refractive    indices. The one on the right probably looks a bit 'plumper' but the only    difference between the pebbles is in refractive index. We are using a method    called Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling to study how human observers    perceive the refractive index of transparent material (with Roland Fleming and    Frank J\u00e4kel; images by Roland Fleming).

[article]         back to the top          Statistical Models of Visual Judgements     Human observers can have multiple sources of information about the shape,    location, orientation, color or material of objects in a scene and each source is    typically perturbed by error. Combining these sources of information into a    single estimate is a fundamental problem in statistics. In our work, we compare    human performance in combining information for multiple sources to optimal    performance. We have investigated cue combination in human perception of depth,    shape, slant and color.     In one recent experiment (Oru\u00e7, Maloney &amp; Landy, 2003), we asked observers to    repeatedly adjust the slant of a plane to 75 deg. Feedback was provided after    each setting and the observers trained extensively until their setting error    stabilized. We designed the experiment so that we could determine whether the    observer's estimates of slant from each of two slant cues were correlated or    uncorrelated.     The slant of the plane was defined by either linear perspective alone (a grid of lines) or texture gradient alone (diamond-shaped    texture elements) or the two cues together. We chose a HIGH and LOW variance    version of each cue type and measured setting variability in four single-cue    conditions (LOW, HIGH for each cue) and in the four possible combined-cue    conditions (LOW-LOW, LOW-HIGH, etc.).     We compared performance in the combined-cue conditions to predictions based on    single-cue performance. Six out of eight observers did better with combined cues    than with either cue alone, showing that they were in fact combining information    from both cues. For three observers, performance was consistent with optimal    combination of uncorrelated cues. Three other observers' results were also    consistent with optimal combination, but with the assumption that internal cue    estimates were correlated. The remaining two observers' performances were    sub-optimal.          Knoblauch, K. &amp; Maloney, L. T. (2008), MLDS: Maximum likelihood difference    scaling in R.

[ pdf ]         back to the top          Geometrical Models of Visual Judgments     The papers below describe experiments where subjects were asked to perform    geometric judgments in binocular space, color space or face space. We are    interested in how observers represent space, color and complex stimuli and what    kinds of judgments they can perform on these representations. Our goal is to    better understand the 'machinery of the brain.'     The figure below, taken from Trommersh\u00e4user, Maloney &amp; Landy (2003) comes    form a series of experiments examining geometric judgments in near binocular    space where hand and eye typically work together. Our goal in doing this    experiment was to see whether the visual system's judgments of bisection and    collinearity were accurate in this 'visual grasp space'.          The figure shows the outcome of one observer's bisection setting (red dot) when    she was asked to set the point that bisected the intervals joining two other    points that are not shown in the diagram because, at this scale, they would be    very far away. We found that observers' settings in visual grasp space are    typically inconsistent with any simple geometry,and that observers differ from    one another in no patterned way. Although each observer saw an idiosyncratic,    distorted picture of the world, the observer's perception of collinearity and    bisection was roughly invariant under small eye movements.     We are also engaged in studying super-threshold color differences ('color    proximity') and the geometry of color space using newly developed scaling    methods.

As an extension to our work on cue    combination, we are examining what facial information human observers can    abstract about genetic relatedness: specifically how well can they judge whether    pairs of children are siblings?     The pictures below on the left portray the four children of Charles Marsham,    First Earl of Romney ( The Marsham Children by Thomas Gainsborough, 1787    Staatliche Museen, Berlin, Photo credit: Bildarchiv Preussicher Kulturbesitz /    Art Resource, NY). While we use photos of children in our studies, the evident    similarities and differences in the Marsham children's faces give an idea of the    complexity of the task of judging kinship from faces.          In Maloney &amp; Dal Martello (2006), we examine the connection between a    hypothetical kin recognition signal available in visual perception and the    perceived facial similarity of children. One group of observers rated the facial    similarity of pairs of children portrayed in photographs. Half of the pairs were    siblings but the observers were not told this. A second group classified the    pairs as siblings or non-siblings. An optimal Bayesian classifier, given the    similarity ratings of the first group, was as accurate in judging siblings as the    second group. Mean rated similarity (above right) was also an accurate linear    predictor ( R 2 = 0.96 ) of the log-odds that the rated pair portrayed    were, in fact, siblings. Surprisingly, mean rated similarity did not vary with    the age difference or gender difference of the pairs, both of which were    counterbalanced across the stimuli. We conclude that the perceived facial    similarity of children is little more than a graded kin recognition signal and    that this kin recognition signal is effectively an estimate of the probability    that two children are close genetic relatives. With Felicita Dal Martello.          In a second study (Dal Martello &amp; Maloney, in press), we report two    experiments intended to determine where in the face the cues signalling kinship    fall. In both experiments, participants were shown thirty pairs of photographs of    children's faces. Half of the pairs portrayed siblings and half did not. The 220    participants were asked to judge whether each pair of photos portrayed siblings.    We measured the effect on kin recognition performance of masks that covered the    upper half of the face or the lower half (Experiment 1) and the eye region or the    mouth region (Experiment 2). Examples of the stimuli for Experiment 1 are shown    above (yes, they are siblings). In Experiment 1 we found that the signal    detection estimate of performance decreased only 5.3% (n.s.) when the lower face    was masked but by more than 65% when the upper face was masked. We tested whether    combination of kinship information from the two halves of the face can be treated    as optimal combination of independent cues and found that it could be. In    Experiment 2, we found that masking the eye region led to only a 20% reduction    (n.s.) in performance while masking the mouth region led to a non-significant    increase in performance. We also found that the eye region contains only slightly    more information about kinship than the upper half of the face outside of the eye    region.     We are engaged in further studies concerning the localization of kinship and    other sources of information within the face and testing how faces are encoded.    With Felicita Dal Martello.
