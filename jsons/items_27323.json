Additional Courses You May Consider to Complete Your Certificate    Please select two of the following courses to complete your certificate.    Playwriting I    NCRD-UT 30       A playwriting workshop required of all students. Students are required to complete 50-70 pages of a full-length stage play with an outline of the complete play. The first third of the course focuses on exercises to help students develop a story idea with the complexity and depth to sustain a full-length play. The reading and analysis of four to six dramatic texts is required in conjunction with the student\u2019s original work. Students must come to the first class with two ideas for a full-length play. Each idea should be described in a one page summary. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule . Screenwriting I NCRD-UT 8003          A screenwriting workshop required of all Dramatic Writing majors and designed for the beginning screenwriter. Students are required to complete 50-70 pages of a full-length screenplay with an outline of the rest. The first third of the course focuses on exercises to help students develop five story ideas with the complexity and depth to sustain a full-length screenplay. One of these ideas will serve as the basis for the required work. The reading and analysis of four to six screenplays is required in conjunction with the student\u2019s original work. Students must come to the first class with three ideas for full-length screenplays. Each idea can be described in one or two paragraphs. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .  Sketch Comedy Writing   NCRD-UT 8012    This is a sketch writing workshop class. A survey of sketch genres and approaches will be integrated with writing assignments and rewriting of one's own sketches: both privately and collaboratively. The goal is for each student to emerge from the class with several polished sketches. For this class, it helps to have a good sense of humor that you want to get even better at putting down on the page. There will be a lot of group critiquing and occasionally group rewriting. So it helps to stop thinking that your first draft is perfect. Because it isn't. This can be a pretty wild class, so it also helps to never think that comedy can go \"too far.\" The course may have a guest lecturer. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .

Course Level: Intermediate This new course, aimed at second semester sophomores, is the launch pad of Television Writing in the department. Before taking any other TV writing courses, students must take Introduction To Television Writing. The course will introduce sophomores interested in TV writing to all aspects of what goes into the creation of a script for a TV program. It is also recommended for non-writers who wish to learn the fundamentals of TV writing as preparation for creating shows and working with writers. The course will also prepare students for other TV-writing courses in the departmental Television Progression. Half-hour comedy, both multi-cam and single cam, and Hour-long drama are the main focus of the course. Students will learn how to come up with storylines, what outlines and treatments entail, the difference between writing for primetime network and cable, collaboration, what it\u2019s like to be on a writing staff, creating an original Pilot and all aspects of writing for television. After taking Introduction To Television Writing, students will be ready to decide whether to move into comedy writing, hour-long drama writing or both. The course is also open to seniors with an interest in television writing who haven\u2019t taken other TV writing courses.
