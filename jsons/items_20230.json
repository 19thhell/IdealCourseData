In class, we will primarily follow Herstein, but there are many other sources available. Some of these are freely available online; others are available in the library.         Judson, Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications    An open-source algebra textbook with more examples than Herstein's book      Dummit and Foote, Algebra      Several open-source algebra textbooks can be found at http://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/      Several algebra textbooks are reviewed at https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm#i:general-abstract-algebra         Grading scheme   Assignments 25%   Midterm 25%   Quizzes (2) 20% (10% each)   Final exam 30%      Exam dates   Quiz 1: September 29  Midterm: October 27th  Quiz 2: November 24th  Final: Monday, December 15th, 8--9:50 AM (but please keep an eye  on the Registrar's website , as this is subject to change)     About assignments   Assignments will usually be given on Wednesdays and discussed in  recitation the next Friday (9 days later). Collaboration is  encouraged, but each student must write up and hand in their own  solutions. If you work closely with someone else, please identify  them on your assignment (e.g., \"I worked with __________\").  Solutions will be posted shortly after the assignments are discussed  in recitation. To earn credit, assignments must be turned in at  the start of the recitation where it is discussed. Assignments will  not be accepted by email or in a mailbox; if you must miss recitation  due to some emergency, give your assignment to a classmate to turn in  for you. At the end of the semester, your lowest grade on an  assignment will be dropped from your average.   Solving problems is important! Doing exercises and understanding  the assignments is the best way to master the material.   How to do well in this class   Come to class and recitation!  Solve problems!  Ask me questions: Feel free to ask me questions in class,  after class, at office hours, or by email. Feel free to ask  questions in recitation.  Ask your classmates questions: Mathematics is about  collaboration. Explaining something to someone else is one of the  best ways to learn.  Read actively and study diligently! The true goal of  this course is to learn how to prove theorems and facts about  groups, rings, and fields. So, as you read the textbook or review  your notes, read actively. Check calculations and check each step  of a proof. Fill in any gaps. Solve exercises. Try explaining  the proof to someone else. Try proving theorems yourself before  looking at the proof. Ask yourself questions like:     What new tricks and techniques does this proof use?   What if I tried another way to prove this?    What's a simple example of this definition?   What's a complicated example of this definition?        Assignments     Assignment 1 (due Sept. 12) (solutions)    Errata: Added \"where \\(m,b\\in \\mathbb{R}\\)\" to definition of affine function. In problem #1a from Herstein, the notation \"\\(a\\cdot b\\equiv a-b\\)\" defines \\(a\\cdot b\\) to be the quantity \\(a-b\\) -- it isn't a congruence.  Assignment 2 (due Sept. 19) (solutions)    Errata: In problem #3 from Herstein, add the assumption that  \\(G\\) has more than one element.  Assignment 3 (due Sept. 26) (solutions)    Errata: (2014-09-22) Corrected typos in problems 3 and  4. Added hint for problem 3.  Assignment 4 (due Oct. 3) (solutions)   Assignment 5 (due Oct. 10) (solutions)    Errata (2014-10-03): Clarified #2.  Solutions to Quiz 1  Assignment 6 (due Oct. 17) (solutions)    Errata (2014-10-15): Problem 10 from Herstein uses unusual notation. In our usual notation, it would read:    Let \\(G\\) be a finite group, \\(T\\) an automorphism of \\(G\\) with the property that \\(x=T(x)\\) for \\(x\\in G\\) if and only if \\(x=e\\). Prove that every \\(g\\in G\\) can be represented as \\(g=x^{-1}T(x)\\) for some \\(x\\in G\\).    Errata (2014-10-15): Clarified problem 5(b) and added a  set of axes for drawing the graph of \\(\\bar{f}_2\\)  Assignment 7 (due Oct. 31) (solutions)    Errata (2014-10-29): Clarified problem 4, added optional problem about multiplying permutations.  Assignment 8 (due Nov. 7) (solutions)   Hint (2014-11-05): In #3, the Fundamental Theorem of  Finite Abelian Groups implies that you can write \\(G=\\mathbb{Z}_{n_1}\\times\\dots\\times  \\mathbb{Z}_{n_k}\\), where \\(o(G)=n_1\\dots n_k\\). Since \\(m\\) divides \\(o(G)\\), you can write  \\(m=m_1\\dots m_k\\) where \\(m_i\\) divides \\(n_i\\) for all  \\(i\\). Use this to find the desired subgroup.

Judson, Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications    An open-source algebra textbook with more examples than Herstein's book      Dummit and Foote, Algebra      Several open-source algebra textbooks can be found at http://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/      Several algebra textbooks are reviewed at https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm#i:general-abstract-algebra         Grading scheme   Assignments 25%   Midterm 25%   Quizzes (2) 20% (10% each)   Final exam 30%      Exam dates   Quiz 1: September 29  Midterm: October 27th  Quiz 2: November 24th  Final: Monday, December 15th, 8--9:50 AM (but please keep an eye  on the Registrar's website , as this is subject to change)     About assignments   Assignments will usually be given on Wednesdays and discussed in  recitation the next Friday (9 days later). Collaboration is  encouraged, but each student must write up and hand in their own  solutions. If you work closely with someone else, please identify  them on your assignment (e.g., \"I worked with __________\").  Solutions will be posted shortly after the assignments are discussed  in recitation. To earn credit, assignments must be turned in at  the start of the recitation where it is discussed. Assignments will  not be accepted by email or in a mailbox; if you must miss recitation  due to some emergency, give your assignment to a classmate to turn in  for you. At the end of the semester, your lowest grade on an  assignment will be dropped from your average.   Solving problems is important! Doing exercises and understanding  the assignments is the best way to master the material.   How to do well in this class   Come to class and recitation!  Solve problems!  Ask me questions: Feel free to ask me questions in class,  after class, at office hours, or by email. Feel free to ask  questions in recitation.  Ask your classmates questions: Mathematics is about  collaboration. Explaining something to someone else is one of the  best ways to learn.  Read actively and study diligently! The true goal of  this course is to learn how to prove theorems and facts about  groups, rings, and fields. So, as you read the textbook or review  your notes, read actively. Check calculations and check each step  of a proof. Fill in any gaps. Solve exercises. Try explaining  the proof to someone else. Try proving theorems yourself before  looking at the proof. Ask yourself questions like:     What new tricks and techniques does this proof use?   What if I tried another way to prove this?    What's a simple example of this definition?   What's a complicated example of this definition?        Assignments     Assignment 1 (due Sept. 12) (solutions)    Errata: Added \"where \\(m,b\\in \\mathbb{R}\\)\" to definition of affine function. In problem #1a from Herstein, the notation \"\\(a\\cdot b\\equiv a-b\\)\" defines \\(a\\cdot b\\) to be the quantity \\(a-b\\) -- it isn't a congruence.  Assignment 2 (due Sept. 19) (solutions)    Errata: In problem #3 from Herstein, add the assumption that  \\(G\\) has more than one element.  Assignment 3 (due Sept. 26) (solutions)    Errata: (2014-09-22) Corrected typos in problems 3 and  4. Added hint for problem 3.  Assignment 4 (due Oct. 3) (solutions)   Assignment 5 (due Oct. 10) (solutions)    Errata (2014-10-03): Clarified #2.  Solutions to Quiz 1  Assignment 6 (due Oct. 17) (solutions)    Errata (2014-10-15): Problem 10 from Herstein uses unusual notation. In our usual notation, it would read:    Let \\(G\\) be a finite group, \\(T\\) an automorphism of \\(G\\) with the property that \\(x=T(x)\\) for \\(x\\in G\\) if and only if \\(x=e\\). Prove that every \\(g\\in G\\) can be represented as \\(g=x^{-1}T(x)\\) for some \\(x\\in G\\).    Errata (2014-10-15): Clarified problem 5(b) and added a  set of axes for drawing the graph of \\(\\bar{f}_2\\)  Assignment 7 (due Oct. 31) (solutions)    Errata (2014-10-29): Clarified problem 4, added optional problem about multiplying permutations.  Assignment 8 (due Nov. 7) (solutions)   Hint (2014-11-05): In #3, the Fundamental Theorem of  Finite Abelian Groups implies that you can write \\(G=\\mathbb{Z}_{n_1}\\times\\dots\\times  \\mathbb{Z}_{n_k}\\), where \\(o(G)=n_1\\dots n_k\\). Since \\(m\\) divides \\(o(G)\\), you can write  \\(m=m_1\\dots m_k\\) where \\(m_i\\) divides \\(n_i\\) for all  \\(i\\). Use this to find the desired subgroup.
