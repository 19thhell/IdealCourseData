                     Areas of Expertise       Dr. Tuchman has expertise in women\u2019s substance abuse, health and mental health, with a focus on injecting drug using practices and HIV risk in urban resource-poor community on the Lower Eastside of New York City. In addition, she has expertise in the integration of evidence-based mental health practice for individuals with severe mental illness in classroom and field learning.                         Biography     Dr. Ellen Tuchman is an associate professor and coordinator for the New York State Office of Mental Health\u2019s Evidence-Based Practice Project at the Silver School of Social Work. She received her master's, post-master's advanced certificate in clinical social work, and PhD from the New York University Silver School of Social Work. Dr. Tuchman is currently examining the social, contextual, and behavioral dimensions of injecting practices among female injecting drug users. Additional research interests include innovative interdisciplinary substance abuse treatments; gender differences in substance abuse; education among NYU students from medicine, dentistry, nursing, and social work about addiction and the fundamentals of clinical research; and the integrating of evidenced based mental health practices in the classroom curriculum and field education.   Dr. Tuchman is currently an investigator on the NIDA funded Substance Abuse Research Education and Training (SARET) Program, an innovative initiative to educate and spur interest among NYU students from medicine, dentistry, nursing, and social work about addiction and the fundamentals of clinical research. Participants engage in a series of interactive, content-rich web-based learning modules and are given opportunities to engage in stipend-supported summer-time or year-long research investigations with leading NYU substance abuse scientists across diverse disciplines.\u2028Dr. Tuchman has been principal investigator of research studies on two interrelated areas: the NIH/NIDA Office-Based Methadone Prescribing study in which she developed, implemented, and evaluated a primary care substance abuse model of treatment and menopause, sexuality, and HIV risk-taking behaviors among midlife women in methadone treatment.   Dr. Tuchman is coordinator of the Evidence Based Mental Health Project at the New York University Silver School of Social Work. The Project seeks to prepare master\u2019s-level social work students to enter a changing workforce that focuses on empirically validated treatments for individuals diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Through a specially designed project course curriculum and selected field placements, students participate in an integrated learning approach to evidence\u2013based practices approved by the NYS OMH: Assertive Community Treatment, Integrated Dual Disorder Treatment, Family Psychoeducation, Wellness Self Management, and Supported Employment.   Before coming to the School she served as program manager for the NY State Department of Health Primary Care Initiative. Dr. Tuchman established a cooperative partnership to enhance the availability, accessibility, and coordination of primary medical care within methadone programs for the substance abuse population of lower Manhattan. She has served on the planning committee for Healthy Women: A Mandate for Affordable Health Care for All, a symposium on Women's Health across the Life Span sponsored by Rekindling Reform and the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, and two mental health recovery conferences sponsored by the Silver School of Social Work.   Since joining the faculty in 2005, Dr. Tuchman's teaching has been across all three programs (undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral) and two curriculum areas (practice and research). She teaches Social Work Research, Program Evaluation, Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health, Clinical Practice with Substance Abusing Individuals and Families, and Social and Behavioral Intervention Research. In collaboration with the Office of Alternative Breaks, Dr. Tuchman teaches an HIV/AIDS Education: Service Learning in Ghana course and a two-week service-learning trip in January.

                     Areas of Expertise       Dr. Tuchman has expertise in women\u2019s substance abuse, health and mental health, with a focus on injecting drug using practices and HIV risk in urban resource-poor community on the Lower Eastside of New York City. In addition, she has expertise in the integration of evidence-based mental health practice for individuals with severe mental illness in classroom and field learning.                         Biography     Dr. Ellen Tuchman is an associate professor and coordinator for the New York State Office of Mental Health\u2019s Evidence-Based Practice Project at the Silver School of Social Work. She received her master's, post-master's advanced certificate in clinical social work, and PhD from the New York University Silver School of Social Work. Dr. Tuchman is currently examining the social, contextual, and behavioral dimensions of injecting practices among female injecting drug users. Additional research interests include innovative interdisciplinary substance abuse treatments; gender differences in substance abuse; education among NYU students from medicine, dentistry, nursing, and social work about addiction and the fundamentals of clinical research; and the integrating of evidenced based mental health practices in the classroom curriculum and field education.   Dr. Tuchman is currently an investigator on the NIDA funded Substance Abuse Research Education and Training (SARET) Program, an innovative initiative to educate and spur interest among NYU students from medicine, dentistry, nursing, and social work about addiction and the fundamentals of clinical research. Participants engage in a series of interactive, content-rich web-based learning modules and are given opportunities to engage in stipend-supported summer-time or year-long research investigations with leading NYU substance abuse scientists across diverse disciplines.\u2028Dr. Tuchman has been principal investigator of research studies on two interrelated areas: the NIH/NIDA Office-Based Methadone Prescribing study in which she developed, implemented, and evaluated a primary care substance abuse model of treatment and menopause, sexuality, and HIV risk-taking behaviors among midlife women in methadone treatment.   Dr. Tuchman is coordinator of the Evidence Based Mental Health Project at the New York University Silver School of Social Work. The Project seeks to prepare master\u2019s-level social work students to enter a changing workforce that focuses on empirically validated treatments for individuals diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Through a specially designed project course curriculum and selected field placements, students participate in an integrated learning approach to evidence\u2013based practices approved by the NYS OMH: Assertive Community Treatment, Integrated Dual Disorder Treatment, Family Psychoeducation, Wellness Self Management, and Supported Employment.   Before coming to the School she served as program manager for the NY State Department of Health Primary Care Initiative. Dr. Tuchman established a cooperative partnership to enhance the availability, accessibility, and coordination of primary medical care within methadone programs for the substance abuse population of lower Manhattan. She has served on the planning committee for Healthy Women: A Mandate for Affordable Health Care for All, a symposium on Women's Health across the Life Span sponsored by Rekindling Reform and the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, and two mental health recovery conferences sponsored by the Silver School of Social Work.   Since joining the faculty in 2005, Dr. Tuchman's teaching has been across all three programs (undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral) and two curriculum areas (practice and research). She teaches Social Work Research, Program Evaluation, Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health, Clinical Practice with Substance Abusing Individuals and Families, and Social and Behavioral Intervention Research. In collaboration with the Office of Alternative Breaks, Dr. Tuchman teaches an HIV/AIDS Education: Service Learning in Ghana course and a two-week service-learning trip in January.

                              What if you had to live immersed full-time in the lives of people recovering from alcohol and drug addictions? Danielle Rich, MSW \u201914, and Jennifer Glass, MSW \u201915, accepted this challenge when they travelled with a group of other NYU Silver students to Rimini, Italy this summer.   Under the guidance of substance abuse experts Professor Lala Straussner (Silver) and Retired Professor Shlomo Einstein (Hebrew University), the course, \u201cInternational Perspectives on Substance Use Problems and Treatment Models: An Italian Approach,\u201d brought students to San Patrignano (\u201cSanPa\u201d), a renowned therapeutic community.   Silver students spent 10 days living, eating and working among residents. (Students slept in small cottages reserved just for them, however.) Students abided by all the rules that applied to residents, including \u2028set meal times and walking the grounds in groups of no fewer than 3 or 4 people. Residents are never allowed to be alone, even in lavatories. True to Italian culture, Rich says, the menus are dominated by pasta, and a small glass of wine is served at lunch and dinner. Residents with alcohol issues may refrain from drinking, however.   Students were expected to work in one of SanPa\u2019s 52 vocational training areas, such as laundry, vineyards, graphic design, and wine- and cheese-making. SanPa sells its high-quality products outside the community; the income plus donations enable residents to live and receive treatment free of charge.   Students attended class in the mornings with Professors Straussner and Einstein. SanPa staff also lectured students on its approach. The average length of stay is 3-4 years, Glass says, compared with the 28-day model that is standard in the United States. It is estimated that much of the success of SanPa\u2019s treatment is due to the combination of peer support, involvement in training programs, and allowing the time and space to work on recovery without feeling rushed or being discharged prematurely.   The peer-support model relies heavily on \u201cresponsibles,\u201d longer-term residents who provide guidance and encouragement to newer ones. Glass and Rich say that they and several of the students in their group developed close connections with some of these very warm, open people who assisted them during their stay.   Glass says that the trip was not the typical study abroad experience \u2014 the immersion with residents was challenging and intense. Rich said that at first she was uncomfortable with the constant presence of other people; but later on, when she left the premises for a day, she felt very lonely, an unfamiliar emotion for her. Both students learned how powerful people are to each other; the strength transmitted through individuals with similar struggles is an amazing testament to the human spirit.   &quot;It was a unique and inspiring experience; I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn in such an environment with Professors Straussner and Einstein,\u201d Glass says. \u201cAny student interested in working in the area of addictions should jump at the chance to participate in this course; I would do it again in a heartbeat.&quot;       By Jes Champagne, MSW \u201914       For more information about the San Patrignano rehabilitation community, visit www.sanpatrignano.org/en/rehabilitation-community-brief .

                     Areas of Expertise       Dr. Tuchman has expertise in women\u2019s substance abuse, health and mental health, with a focus on injecting drug using practices and HIV risk in urban resource-poor community on the Lower Eastside of New York City. In addition, she has expertise in the integration of evidence-based mental health practice for individuals with severe mental illness in classroom and field learning.                         Biography     Dr. Ellen Tuchman is an associate professor and coordinator for the New York State Office of Mental Health\u2019s Evidence-Based Practice Project at the Silver School of Social Work. She received her master's, post-master's advanced certificate in clinical social work, and PhD from the New York University Silver School of Social Work. Dr. Tuchman is currently examining the social, contextual, and behavioral dimensions of injecting practices among female injecting drug users. Additional research interests include innovative interdisciplinary substance abuse treatments; gender differences in substance abuse; education among NYU students from medicine, dentistry, nursing, and social work about addiction and the fundamentals of clinical research; and the integrating of evidenced based mental health practices in the classroom curriculum and field education.   Dr. Tuchman is currently an investigator on the NIDA funded Substance Abuse Research Education and Training (SARET) Program, an innovative initiative to educate and spur interest among NYU students from medicine, dentistry, nursing, and social work about addiction and the fundamentals of clinical research. Participants engage in a series of interactive, content-rich web-based learning modules and are given opportunities to engage in stipend-supported summer-time or year-long research investigations with leading NYU substance abuse scientists across diverse disciplines.\u2028Dr. Tuchman has been principal investigator of research studies on two interrelated areas: the NIH/NIDA Office-Based Methadone Prescribing study in which she developed, implemented, and evaluated a primary care substance abuse model of treatment and menopause, sexuality, and HIV risk-taking behaviors among midlife women in methadone treatment.   Dr. Tuchman is coordinator of the Evidence Based Mental Health Project at the New York University Silver School of Social Work. The Project seeks to prepare master\u2019s-level social work students to enter a changing workforce that focuses on empirically validated treatments for individuals diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Through a specially designed project course curriculum and selected field placements, students participate in an integrated learning approach to evidence\u2013based practices approved by the NYS OMH: Assertive Community Treatment, Integrated Dual Disorder Treatment, Family Psychoeducation, Wellness Self Management, and Supported Employment.   Before coming to the School she served as program manager for the NY State Department of Health Primary Care Initiative. Dr. Tuchman established a cooperative partnership to enhance the availability, accessibility, and coordination of primary medical care within methadone programs for the substance abuse population of lower Manhattan. She has served on the planning committee for Healthy Women: A Mandate for Affordable Health Care for All, a symposium on Women's Health across the Life Span sponsored by Rekindling Reform and the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, and two mental health recovery conferences sponsored by the Silver School of Social Work.   Since joining the faculty in 2005, Dr. Tuchman's teaching has been across all three programs (undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral) and two curriculum areas (practice and research). She teaches Social Work Research, Program Evaluation, Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health, Clinical Practice with Substance Abusing Individuals and Families, and Social and Behavioral Intervention Research. In collaboration with the Office of Alternative Breaks, Dr. Tuchman teaches an HIV/AIDS Education: Service Learning in Ghana course and a two-week service-learning trip in January.

                              What if you had to live immersed full-time in the lives of people recovering from alcohol and drug addictions? Danielle Rich, MSW \u201914, and Jennifer Glass, MSW \u201915, accepted this challenge when they travelled with a group of other NYU Silver students to Rimini, Italy this summer.   Under the guidance of substance abuse experts Professor Lala Straussner (Silver) and Retired Professor Shlomo Einstein (Hebrew University), the course, \u201cInternational Perspectives on Substance Use Problems and Treatment Models: An Italian Approach,\u201d brought students to San Patrignano (\u201cSanPa\u201d), a renowned therapeutic community.   Silver students spent 10 days living, eating and working among residents. (Students slept in small cottages reserved just for them, however.) Students abided by all the rules that applied to residents, including \u2028set meal times and walking the grounds in groups of no fewer than 3 or 4 people. Residents are never allowed to be alone, even in lavatories. True to Italian culture, Rich says, the menus are dominated by pasta, and a small glass of wine is served at lunch and dinner. Residents with alcohol issues may refrain from drinking, however.   Students were expected to work in one of SanPa\u2019s 52 vocational training areas, such as laundry, vineyards, graphic design, and wine- and cheese-making. SanPa sells its high-quality products outside the community; the income plus donations enable residents to live and receive treatment free of charge.   Students attended class in the mornings with Professors Straussner and Einstein. SanPa staff also lectured students on its approach. The average length of stay is 3-4 years, Glass says, compared with the 28-day model that is standard in the United States. It is estimated that much of the success of SanPa\u2019s treatment is due to the combination of peer support, involvement in training programs, and allowing the time and space to work on recovery without feeling rushed or being discharged prematurely.   The peer-support model relies heavily on \u201cresponsibles,\u201d longer-term residents who provide guidance and encouragement to newer ones. Glass and Rich say that they and several of the students in their group developed close connections with some of these very warm, open people who assisted them during their stay.   Glass says that the trip was not the typical study abroad experience \u2014 the immersion with residents was challenging and intense. Rich said that at first she was uncomfortable with the constant presence of other people; but later on, when she left the premises for a day, she felt very lonely, an unfamiliar emotion for her. Both students learned how powerful people are to each other; the strength transmitted through individuals with similar struggles is an amazing testament to the human spirit.   &quot;It was a unique and inspiring experience; I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn in such an environment with Professors Straussner and Einstein,\u201d Glass says. \u201cAny student interested in working in the area of addictions should jump at the chance to participate in this course; I would do it again in a heartbeat.&quot;       By Jes Champagne, MSW \u201914       For more information about the San Patrignano rehabilitation community, visit www.sanpatrignano.org/en/rehabilitation-community-brief .

November 6, 2013                                                   On Friday November 1, students and faculty gathered in the Parlor at 1 WSN for a lunch reception to honor visiting residents from San Patrignano (SanPa), a therapeutic community (TC) in Italy for the treatment of substance use problems. Our guests were members of SanPa\u2019s running team, here to participate in Sunday\u2019s ING New York City Marathon. (Read the New York Times story about them here .) They were accompanied by Dr. Antonio Boschini, a former resident of the community who went on to earn his medical degree from the University of Verona, and now oversees SanPa\u2019s state-of-the-art, on-campus medical facility.     SanPa\u2019s services are completely free, and it stresses the importance of learning work skills to internalize positive self-image and improve relationships with individuals and society. Residents work in one of the facility\u2019s many sectors, which include woodworking and design workshops, an award-winning vineyard, equine and canine rescue, and the medical center.     Following the lunch, an informal roundtable discussion began, with bilingual residents helping with English/Italian translation. Mike, an American resident of SanPa who just &quot;graduated&quot; from the program, said it was ultimately the only rehabilitation model that worked for him. He spoke of being able to &quot;put on masks&quot; and fool his doctors and therapists in the treatments he tried in the United States: &quot;I\u2019m not able to wear that mask at SanPa. It helped me wake up and realize I was losing time.&quot; Mike plans to return to the US this spring to begin his bachelor\u2019s in Social Work.     Dr. Boschini detailed the mission of SanPa, which he described as a &quot;secular open community, free to all, where the only requirement for admission is a real motivation to change.&quot; Boschini doesn\u2019t consider addiction a disease or chronic affliction: &quot;The addict who enters the community is a normal human being who needs help learning to work, study, and relate to others.&quot; He stressed the non-theoretical, relational emphasis of SanPa, in which change is built slowly over time. Indeed, the average length of stay at the facility is three-to-four years, nearly double the length of similar American TCs, which run 18 to 24 months. And this extended duration may play a role in SanPa\u2019s extraordinary success rate: a 2005 study found that of residents who completed the entire program (70% completion rate), 70% remained drug-free after four years.

SanPa served as the global learning site for last summer\u2019s \u201cInternational Perspectives on Substance Use Problems and Treatment Models: An Italian Approach,\u201d taught by Professor Lala Straussner . (To read more about the program, click here .)     Kayla Butler, an Advanced Standing student in the Substance Abuse Focused Learning Opportunity (FLO), participated in the course and organized the reception. She and other students from the class reminisced about their experiences at SanPa, and wished the runners \u201cbuona fortuna\u201d on their marathon. The runners seemed calm, quiet and intensely focused on the challenge awaiting them on Sunday. But Dr. Boschini put the task into perspective saying, &quot;We\u2019ve come to New York to run the marathon, but it\u2019s not the only marathon of our lives.&quot;    By Penelope Yates, \u201916                Type: Article                                                                SanPa runners near the finish line.
