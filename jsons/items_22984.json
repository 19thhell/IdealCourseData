Proposing that a technology like 3D printing \u2014 which is becoming increasingly cheaper, better, faster and omnipresent \u2014 can change the world, and actually calling it a new industrial revolution might raise lot\u2019s of neck hair stand on end.   But the author\u2019s experience as an editor and writer (I also recommend his two other books: the Long Tail about the rise of niche products and services in a mass market global economy, and Free, a book about how pricing schemes of $0 and giving thing away can still be a profitable business model) plays to his favour, crafting a coherent and enthusiastic discourse with enough back up stories to make it sound not only believable, but desirable as well.   In his vision of the near future, or even more, our current present, home-brew manufacturing stands to revolutionise the American economy. Is he right about this?   In 1776 the (first) Industrial Revolution replaced human power with machine power, thus amplifying human potential. Machines could take a simple gesture, or small physical effort from a person first, a water, steam, diesel or electrical machine later, and obtain faster results with less effort. \u201cThings\u201d could be built, but more to that, industries were born, both in the sense of a place with building facilities, and also in the economical terms of marketplace and trade.   He proposes there\u2019s a second Industrial Revolution, the digital revolution of the late seventies and early eighties, with Personal Computers. Interestingly enough, he sets the date to 1985, when Apple released the LaserWriter printer as a Desktop Publishing platform, and not the release of the Personal Computers a few years before that.   In that way, using the word Desktop (desktop computer, desktop publishing, desktop manufacturing) empowers industrial changes just presented democratising the tools of creation. Publishing quickly became the common thing on the web \u2014 and the web became the common thing before that, so we \u201cposted, uploaded, and shared\u201d our way into this decade. Desktop technologies gave people tools of digital creation. Once attached to the network, the tools of distribution were democratised. Now we can do the same that big corporations could previously do, at least still in the digital trade.   But does the same paradigm apply to 3D prints? And how?   From that on \u2014 he argues \u2013 it\u2019s not hard to see that the past ten years have been about finding new social and innovation models on the web, and the following ten are about getting things on the real world; \u201cAtoms are the new bits\u201d he said at a\u00a0 recent conference .   Today, it may seem as a simplified version of reality to just say that with access to digital fabrication tools, wether our own or in a Maker Space or FabLab \u201ceveryone with an idea, will have the tools to realise it\u201d, but it\u2019s a provocative thought, in the same line as in one of it chapter\u2019s title \u201cwe are all designers now, me might as well get good at it\u201d. But no that provocative actually, rather a real trait made clear last weekend on Maker Fair: a 4 year old draws a flower on an iPad, and nobody tells her how to use that. That same flower, five minutes later, was 3D printed ring on her finger. The former strange, far and spectacular becomes vernacular. That&#8217;s the power ok make.   It\u2019s not difficult to agree that many of us ITP\u2019ers are (or came here to become) makers. What does it take to get all those ideas into the \u201creal\u201d world is what makes the difference, and \u201cmaker tools\u201d make that process easy, however there is still a big leap to be made, and that is the gene of need finding and creation.   Tools are just tools. It\u2019s how we use them that makes the difference.

Harry (Chiu-Hao) Chen                      October 9, 2012 at 4:12 am                  No matter what Makers&#8217; have made, to see gorgeous smile from kids that is the pleasure moment for the makers!  see ITP makers&#8217; nerdy derby in Maker Faire. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eRIYs0hxmo                             Ilwon Yoon                      October 9, 2012 at 1:38 pm                  First of all, I am glad that I am able to find the summary of the book, \u201cthe makers: the new industrial revolution\u201d since I was planning to read it. I couldn\u2019t agree more the content of the book that the 2nd Industrial Revolution will be coming in the future with accessible 3D printer machine since I am the one driven by the desire of creating my own things. 3D printer is definitely something that could bring significant changes to the industry as this technology is fully compatible with 3D modeling software that is out in the world for long time. Now our dream of making 3d objects comes true, which was almost impossible, or cost too much effort and time in the past. But I insist that 3D printer is not the sole technology that brings the 2nd industrial revolution to the world for the first time.   Like Dale said in the Reynold conference in last September at Stern school of Business, creative makers and enthusiastic amateurs scientists have been existed in past years. Some of them were ended up with being a great scientist, and others had stayed in the level of what they were capable of, and yet technologies in the past were able to access although it was hard to reach and on the way of developing it. So, what made a distinct deviation that could be called as 2nd industrial revolution is not only advance and accessible technologies, but also the way we share with others. I believe that the sudden emergence of the World Make Faire is caused by the fact that we can share easily what we love and that makes the fun part. Paring with accessible technologies and the desire to share what you love with people in the world, this dream of everybody is designer is becoming true.                             William Lindmeier                      October 10, 2012 at 10:19 am                  I think you&#8217;re spot on about 3D printing. It really feels like a burgeoning tech with a ton of potential, like the personal printer was 20 years ago. If you need convincing, I&#8217;d recommend the latest Wired cover story about the Replicator 2: http://www.wired.com/design/2012/09/how-makerbots-replicator2-will-launch-era-of-desktop-manufacturing/   Since reading that article I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about how the printer could be used. It could be really useful for Pcomp projects for custom fittings, or modding objects in the junk box. I love that it opens up avenues for makers that we haven&#8217;t really considered yet.                             Sergio \"Majluf\"                      October 10, 2012 at 10:28 am                  Thanks for your comments!   What about taking it to the next step? I&#8217;ve talked about this with one of the scientist involved, and it&#8217;s creating, at least, an interesting debate.   Why do we have to 3D Print small objects? Why can&#8217;t we 3D Print a house? A full size car? A Human Kidney?   http://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_printing_a_human_kidney.html                             Mary Fe                      October 12, 2012 at 9:36 pm                  Sergio, can I borrow the book? I also wanted to read it and after going to Maker Fair and seeing all those 3D printers as the new maker&#8217;s popstars, it became a must read.   The other Chris Anderson books seem to point already on the direction that there is a clear change in how the economy organizes and how the society is facing how it consumes things.   I have just read Natalie Tschechaniuk&#8217;s post on hi tech trash &#8220;High Tech Trash: Digital Devices, Hidden Toxics, and Human Health&#8221;, a book by Elizabeth Grossman.   As laser printers raised the issue on preserving trees, the 3D printers already start taking that philosophy into consideration. I saw a model at maker fair that printed using organic compost as raw material and another one that made the 3D prints with old pieces of soap.                             Mary Fe                      October 12, 2012 at 9:41 pm                  By the way, the video about printing organs is amazing! Thanks!                             Sergio \"Majluf\"                      October 13, 2012 at 1:53 pm                  Of course! I&#8217;ll bring it to the floor.   It&#8217;s funny though that we keep legacy limitations on new creations. Did it catch your attention that almost all 3D printers today, disregarding the technology they work with, share the same form factor?   I only remember seeing one of them being different at the fair, basically taking the same width and length, but with much greater height.                             Nancy                      October 13, 2012 at 6:05 pm                  Just jumping in to say this is an interesting discussion. Maybe Making is the 3rd industrial revolution. Computers/electronics definitely the 2nd. And something retro about it too&#8230;going back to making stuff yourself.  Sergio&#8230; interesting about the form factor of printers..all based on desktop publishing&#8230; can you imagine different, more flexible kinds?  Bill.. the idea of new avenues of making&#8230;that would be a great SIG at ITP  and if you do.. include NAtalie.. great post on High Tech Trash..                             Sergio \"Majluf\"                      November 3, 2012 at 1:16 am                  I mentioned large form factor printing in one of my comments. That was linear thinking: just make the &#8220;printer&#8221; bigger.   But I just stumbled upon this article on Fastcodesign website. It&#8217;s not only about printing large structures, rather than printing growing structures; mind-blowing if ou ask me:                            steroidi                      January 27, 2015 at 3:37 am                  steroidi   anabolizzanti                            Teknisi Listrik Panggilan Bandung                      February 5, 2015 at 2:54 am                  Teknisi Listrik Panggilan Bandung   Makers: The New Industrial Revolution \u00ab Fall 2012 &#8211; Applications Readings                            livehere                      April 29, 2015 at 6:13 am                  livehere   [&#8230;]here are some links to web-sites that we link to mainly because we consider they&#8217;re really worth visiting[&#8230;]                            testme                      April 29, 2015 at 10:14 am                  testme   [&#8230;]here are some links to websites that we link to simply because we think they are worth visiting[&#8230;]                            testhim                      April 29, 2015 at 12:50 pm                  testhim   [&#8230;]just beneath, are several absolutely not connected web-sites to ours, having said that, they&#8217;re certainly worth going over[&#8230;]                            findme                      April 29, 2015 at 1:25 pm                  findme   [&#8230;]just beneath, are a lot of completely not associated sites to ours, on the other hand, they may be surely really worth going over[&#8230;]                                                                     Recent Posts                 The Emperor&#8217;s New Bikini and Other Distorted Non-Sites         City of Bits by W.J.

Proposing that a technology like 3D printing \u2014 which is becoming increasingly cheaper, better, faster and omnipresent \u2014 can change the world, and actually calling it a new industrial revolution might raise lot\u2019s of neck hair stand on end.   But the author\u2019s experience as an editor and writer (I also recommend his two other books: the Long Tail about the rise of niche products and services in a mass market global economy, and Free, a book about how pricing schemes of $0 and giving thing away can still be a profitable business model) plays to his favour, crafting a coherent and enthusiastic discourse with enough back up stories to make it sound not only believable, but desirable as well.   In his vision of the near future, or even more, our current present, home-brew manufacturing stands to revolutionise the American economy. Is he right about this?   In 1776 the (first) Industrial Revolution replaced human power with machine power, thus amplifying human potential. Machines could take a simple gesture, or small physical effort from a person first, a water, steam, diesel or electrical machine later, and obtain faster results with less effort. \u201cThings\u201d could be built, but more to that, industries were born, both in the sense of a place with building facilities, and also in the economical terms of marketplace and trade.   He proposes there\u2019s a second Industrial Revolution, the digital revolution of the late seventies and early eighties, with Personal Computers. Interestingly enough, he sets the date to 1985, when Apple released the LaserWriter printer as a Desktop Publishing platform, and not the release of the Personal Computers a few years before that.   In that way, using the word Desktop (desktop computer, desktop publishing, desktop manufacturing) empowers industrial changes just presented democratising the tools of creation. Publishing quickly became the common thing on the web \u2014 and the web became the common thing before that, so we \u201cposted, uploaded, and shared\u201d our way into this decade. Desktop technologies gave people tools of digital creation. Once attached to the network, the tools of distribution were democratised. Now we can do the same that big corporations could previously do, at least still in the digital trade.   But does the same paradigm apply to 3D prints? And how?   From that on \u2014 he argues \u2013 it\u2019s not hard to see that the past ten years have been about finding new social and innovation models on the web, and the following ten are about getting things on the real world; \u201cAtoms are the new bits\u201d he said at a\u00a0 recent conference .   Today, it may seem as a simplified version of reality to just say that with access to digital fabrication tools, wether our own or in a Maker Space or FabLab \u201ceveryone with an idea, will have the tools to realise it\u201d, but it\u2019s a provocative thought, in the same line as in one of it chapter\u2019s title \u201cwe are all designers now, me might as well get good at it\u201d. But no that provocative actually, rather a real trait made clear last weekend on Maker Fair: a 4 year old draws a flower on an iPad, and nobody tells her how to use that. That same flower, five minutes later, was 3D printed ring on her finger. The former strange, far and spectacular becomes vernacular. That&#8217;s the power ok make.   It\u2019s not difficult to agree that many of us ITP\u2019ers are (or came here to become) makers. What does it take to get all those ideas into the \u201creal\u201d world is what makes the difference, and \u201cmaker tools\u201d make that process easy, however there is still a big leap to be made, and that is the gene of need finding and creation.   Tools are just tools. It\u2019s how we use them that makes the difference.

Harry (Chiu-Hao) Chen                      October 9, 2012 at 4:12 am                  No matter what Makers&#8217; have made, to see gorgeous smile from kids that is the pleasure moment for the makers!  see ITP makers&#8217; nerdy derby in Maker Faire. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eRIYs0hxmo                             Ilwon Yoon                      October 9, 2012 at 1:38 pm                  First of all, I am glad that I am able to find the summary of the book, \u201cthe makers: the new industrial revolution\u201d since I was planning to read it. I couldn\u2019t agree more the content of the book that the 2nd Industrial Revolution will be coming in the future with accessible 3D printer machine since I am the one driven by the desire of creating my own things. 3D printer is definitely something that could bring significant changes to the industry as this technology is fully compatible with 3D modeling software that is out in the world for long time. Now our dream of making 3d objects comes true, which was almost impossible, or cost too much effort and time in the past. But I insist that 3D printer is not the sole technology that brings the 2nd industrial revolution to the world for the first time.   Like Dale said in the Reynold conference in last September at Stern school of Business, creative makers and enthusiastic amateurs scientists have been existed in past years. Some of them were ended up with being a great scientist, and others had stayed in the level of what they were capable of, and yet technologies in the past were able to access although it was hard to reach and on the way of developing it. So, what made a distinct deviation that could be called as 2nd industrial revolution is not only advance and accessible technologies, but also the way we share with others. I believe that the sudden emergence of the World Make Faire is caused by the fact that we can share easily what we love and that makes the fun part. Paring with accessible technologies and the desire to share what you love with people in the world, this dream of everybody is designer is becoming true.                             William Lindmeier                      October 10, 2012 at 10:19 am                  I think you&#8217;re spot on about 3D printing. It really feels like a burgeoning tech with a ton of potential, like the personal printer was 20 years ago. If you need convincing, I&#8217;d recommend the latest Wired cover story about the Replicator 2: http://www.wired.com/design/2012/09/how-makerbots-replicator2-will-launch-era-of-desktop-manufacturing/   Since reading that article I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about how the printer could be used. It could be really useful for Pcomp projects for custom fittings, or modding objects in the junk box. I love that it opens up avenues for makers that we haven&#8217;t really considered yet.                             Sergio \"Majluf\"                      October 10, 2012 at 10:28 am                  Thanks for your comments!   What about taking it to the next step? I&#8217;ve talked about this with one of the scientist involved, and it&#8217;s creating, at least, an interesting debate.   Why do we have to 3D Print small objects? Why can&#8217;t we 3D Print a house? A full size car? A Human Kidney?   http://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_printing_a_human_kidney.html                             Mary Fe                      October 12, 2012 at 9:36 pm                  Sergio, can I borrow the book? I also wanted to read it and after going to Maker Fair and seeing all those 3D printers as the new maker&#8217;s popstars, it became a must read.   The other Chris Anderson books seem to point already on the direction that there is a clear change in how the economy organizes and how the society is facing how it consumes things.   I have just read Natalie Tschechaniuk&#8217;s post on hi tech trash &#8220;High Tech Trash: Digital Devices, Hidden Toxics, and Human Health&#8221;, a book by Elizabeth Grossman.   As laser printers raised the issue on preserving trees, the 3D printers already start taking that philosophy into consideration. I saw a model at maker fair that printed using organic compost as raw material and another one that made the 3D prints with old pieces of soap.                             Mary Fe                      October 12, 2012 at 9:41 pm                  By the way, the video about printing organs is amazing! Thanks!                             Sergio \"Majluf\"                      October 13, 2012 at 1:53 pm                  Of course! I&#8217;ll bring it to the floor.   It&#8217;s funny though that we keep legacy limitations on new creations. Did it catch your attention that almost all 3D printers today, disregarding the technology they work with, share the same form factor?   I only remember seeing one of them being different at the fair, basically taking the same width and length, but with much greater height.                             Nancy                      October 13, 2012 at 6:05 pm                  Just jumping in to say this is an interesting discussion. Maybe Making is the 3rd industrial revolution. Computers/electronics definitely the 2nd. And something retro about it too&#8230;going back to making stuff yourself.  Sergio&#8230; interesting about the form factor of printers..all based on desktop publishing&#8230; can you imagine different, more flexible kinds?  Bill.. the idea of new avenues of making&#8230;that would be a great SIG at ITP  and if you do.. include NAtalie.. great post on High Tech Trash..                             Sergio \"Majluf\"                      November 3, 2012 at 1:16 am                  I mentioned large form factor printing in one of my comments. That was linear thinking: just make the &#8220;printer&#8221; bigger.   But I just stumbled upon this article on Fastcodesign website. It&#8217;s not only about printing large structures, rather than printing growing structures; mind-blowing if ou ask me:                            steroidi                      January 27, 2015 at 3:37 am                  steroidi   anabolizzanti                            Teknisi Listrik Panggilan Bandung                      February 5, 2015 at 2:54 am                  Teknisi Listrik Panggilan Bandung   Makers: The New Industrial Revolution \u00ab Fall 2012 &#8211; Applications Readings                            livehere                      April 29, 2015 at 6:13 am                  livehere   [&#8230;]here are some links to web-sites that we link to mainly because we consider they&#8217;re really worth visiting[&#8230;]                            testme                      April 29, 2015 at 10:14 am                  testme   [&#8230;]here are some links to websites that we link to simply because we think they are worth visiting[&#8230;]                            testhim                      April 29, 2015 at 12:50 pm                  testhim   [&#8230;]just beneath, are several absolutely not connected web-sites to ours, having said that, they&#8217;re certainly worth going over[&#8230;]                            findme                      April 29, 2015 at 1:25 pm                  findme   [&#8230;]just beneath, are a lot of completely not associated sites to ours, on the other hand, they may be surely really worth going over[&#8230;]                                                                     Recent Posts                 The Emperor&#8217;s New Bikini and Other Distorted Non-Sites         City of Bits by W.J.
