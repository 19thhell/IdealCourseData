Why am I receiving a form 1098-T?     IRS Form 1098-T, is entitled \"Tuition Statement,\" and contains information to assist the IRS and you in determining if you are eligible to claim educational related tax credits such as the American Opportunity Credit and Lifetime Learning Tax Credit.      The Tax Relief Act of 1997 states that educational institutions, such as New York University, are required to file informational returns with the IRS indicating a student's enrollment, and report either amounts billed, or payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses.   The 1098-T form the student receives in the mail or electronically is the information that was sent to the IRS by New York University. The form is an informational return for your personal records, and is not required to be submitted with your tax return.          Top of Page                How do I receive a copy of Form 1098-T?    *For the 2013 tax year, all eligible students received a 1098-T tax statement by January 31, 2014. For the 2014 tax year, all eligible students will receive a 1098-T tax statement by January 31, 2015.    Receive Your 1098-T electronically:    Students can receive their 1098-T forms electronically.

The university is required by the IRS to either fill in the payments received (Box 1) or the amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses (Box 2). NYU fills out Box 2. Therefore, no 1098-T forms at NYU report information for Box 1.    Top of Page             What amounts are included in Box 2 \"Amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses?\"    The university is required by the IRS to either fill in the payments received (Box 1) or the amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses (Box 2). NYU has chosen to fill in (Box 2) .           Qualified tuition and related expenses are defined as tuition and certain related expenses required for enrollment or attendance at an eligible educational institution. Student-activity fees and expenses for course-related books, supplies, and equipment are included in qualified related expenses only if the fees and expenses must be paid to the institution as a condition of enrollment or attendance.           Unqualified expenses include  university housing, meal plans, health insurance, transportation, or other similar personal, living, or family expenses.    See IRS publication 970 for specific examples of qualified and unqualified tuition and related expenses.             Top of Page                Since I received Form 1098-T from the university, am I qualified for one of the educational tax credits?    Not necessarily. Determination of eligibility is the responsibility of the taxpayer. The university is required to file Form 1098-T with the IRS and to mail a copy to each student who was billed for qualified tuition and related expenses.       Top of Page                How do I determine if I am eligible for an educational tax credit?    You or your parents may be eligible for the educational tax credits on your tax return. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created two educational tax credits for students and families, the American Opportunity Credit and the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit.      For a more detailed description you can read IRS Publication 970 which can be found on the IRS web site .       Top of Page                        I lost my Form 1098-T. What should I do?

Top of Page                Should I attach the Form 1098-T to my tax return?    The 1098-T form is an informational form for your personal records and is not required to be submitted with your tax return.       Top of Page                Where can I get a list of payments made to the University?       Students have a single sign-on to the NYU eSuite through the Albert Student Center via NYUHome. A student's NetID and password are required.    Once in the Albert Student Center, the student clicks on the &quot;VIEW BURSAR ACCOUNT&quot; link, located under the Finances section.    This will link the student to the secure eSuite website.    There are two options for viewing your payment history in the NYU eSuite. One is to navigate to &quot; PAYMENTS ,&quot; then &quot; PAYMENT HISTORY .&quot; Here, you can search for all payments within a date range. Another way to view payments is by navigating to &quot; MY ACCOUNT ,&quot; then &quot; ACCOUNT ACTIVITY .&quot; Here charges and payments applied can be viewed by term.          Top of Page                Where can I get additional information for eligibility on the various tax credits?    For additional information on the American Opportunity Credit and Lifetime Learning credit, please visit IRS Publication 970 , \"Tax Benefits for Education.\"       Top of Page          Why am I not eligible for a 1098-T?    You may not have been issued a 1098-T for various reasons. A 1098-T is not required to be filed with your return; it is informational. A statement of account may be used in lieu of a 1098-T to calculate a potential tax credit. Below are common examples of why a student may not receive a 1098-T.       You are an international student. NYU is not required to furnish the 1098-T to international students.     You did not have eligible enrollment. NYU is not required to furnish the 1098-T for students who did not earn academic credit. For example, SPS Non-Credit courses, non-credit certificate programs, and  maintenance of matriculation only do not constitute eligible academic credit for the 1098-T.    You do not have a TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number) on file with New York University. NYU cannot produce a 1098-T form without this information. TIN information must be provided to the Office of the Registrar.     You had no billed amounts in 2014. For example, if you graduated in Spring 2014, you may have registered and had charges post to your account in November or December of 2013. Thus, those amounts were reported on the 2013 1098-T form. NYU can provide a statement of account in lieu of a 1098-T to calculate a potential tax credit for 2014.

To be viewed, the form must be downloaded into Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.0 or higher. For security reasons, the form cannot be loaded into a browser preview utility.                  Why am I receiving a form 1098-T?     IRS Form 1098-T, is entitled \"Tuition Statement,\" and contains information to assist the IRS and you in determining if you are eligible to claim educational related tax credits such as the American Opportunity Credit and Lifetime Learning Tax Credit.      The Tax Relief Act of 1997 states that educational institutions, such as New York University, are required to file informational returns with the IRS indicating a student's enrollment, and report either amounts billed, or payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses.   The 1098-T form the student receives in the mail or electronically is the information that was sent to the IRS by New York University. The form is an informational return for your personal records, and is not required to be submitted with your tax return.          Top of Page                How do I receive a copy of Form 1098-T?    *For the 2013 tax year, all eligible students received a 1098-T tax statement by January 31, 2014. For the 2014 tax year, all eligible students will receive a 1098-T tax statement by January 31, 2015.    Receive Your 1098-T electronically:    Students can receive their 1098-T forms electronically.

You may change your option at any time, by visiting the &quot;MY PROFILE&quot; section in eSuite.       Top of Page          Why doesn't Box 1 of the 1098-T show the amount of my payments to NYU?    The university is required by the IRS to either fill in the payments received (Box 1) or the amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses (Box 2). NYU fills out Box 2. Therefore, no 1098-T forms at NYU report information for Box 1.    Top of Page             What amounts are included in Box 2 \"Amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses?\"    The university is required by the IRS to either fill in the payments received (Box 1) or the amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses (Box 2). NYU has chosen to fill in (Box 2) .           Qualified tuition and related expenses are defined as tuition and certain related expenses required for enrollment or attendance at an eligible educational institution. Student-activity fees and expenses for course-related books, supplies, and equipment are included in qualified related expenses only if the fees and expenses must be paid to the institution as a condition of enrollment or attendance.           Unqualified expenses include  university housing, meal plans, health insurance, transportation, or other similar personal, living, or family expenses.    See IRS publication 970 for specific examples of qualified and unqualified tuition and related expenses.             Top of Page                Since I received Form 1098-T from the university, am I qualified for one of the educational tax credits?    Not necessarily. Determination of eligibility is the responsibility of the taxpayer. The university is required to file Form 1098-T with the IRS and to mail a copy to each student who was billed for qualified tuition and related expenses.       Top of Page                How do I determine if I am eligible for an educational tax credit?    You or your parents may be eligible for the educational tax credits on your tax return. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created two educational tax credits for students and families, the American Opportunity Credit and the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit.      For a more detailed description you can read IRS Publication 970 which can be found on the IRS web site .       Top of Page                        I lost my Form 1098-T. What should I do?

Top of Page                Should I attach the Form 1098-T to my tax return?    The 1098-T form is an informational form for your personal records and is not required to be submitted with your tax return.       Top of Page                Where can I get a list of payments made to the University?       Students have a single sign-on to the NYU eSuite through the Albert Student Center via NYUHome. A student's NetID and password are required.    Once in the Albert Student Center, the student clicks on the &quot;VIEW BURSAR ACCOUNT&quot; link, located under the Finances section.    This will link the student to the secure eSuite website.    There are two options for viewing your payment history in the NYU eSuite. One is to navigate to &quot; PAYMENTS ,&quot; then &quot; PAYMENT HISTORY .&quot; Here, you can search for all payments within a date range. Another way to view payments is by navigating to &quot; MY ACCOUNT ,&quot; then &quot; ACCOUNT ACTIVITY .&quot; Here charges and payments applied can be viewed by term.          Top of Page                Where can I get additional information for eligibility on the various tax credits?    For additional information on the American Opportunity Credit and Lifetime Learning credit, please visit IRS Publication 970 , \"Tax Benefits for Education.\"       Top of Page          Why am I not eligible for a 1098-T?    You may not have been issued a 1098-T for various reasons. A 1098-T is not required to be filed with your return; it is informational. A statement of account may be used in lieu of a 1098-T to calculate a potential tax credit. Below are common examples of why a student may not receive a 1098-T.       You are an international student. NYU is not required to furnish the 1098-T to international students.     You did not have eligible enrollment. NYU is not required to furnish the 1098-T for students who did not earn academic credit. For example, SPS Non-Credit courses, non-credit certificate programs, and  maintenance of matriculation only do not constitute eligible academic credit for the 1098-T.    You do not have a TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number) on file with New York University. NYU cannot produce a 1098-T form without this information. TIN information must be provided to the Office of the Registrar.     You had no billed amounts in 2014. For example, if you graduated in Spring 2014, you may have registered and had charges post to your account in November or December of 2013. Thus, those amounts were reported on the 2013 1098-T form. NYU can provide a statement of account in lieu of a 1098-T to calculate a potential tax credit for 2014.
