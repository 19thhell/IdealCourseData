See course  schedule for current description. Transnational Feminism SCA-UA 474 Offered in the fall. 4 points. This course examines the limits and possibilities of transnational feminist practices and theories. What does it mean to be \u201ctransnationally literate\u201d in relation to gender and sexuality? How do notions of gender and sexuality shift in the context of the gendered travel, displacements and diasporas created by globalization? How are these contemporary movements shadowed by prior movements precipitated by earlier histories of colonialism, indentured labor and slavery? This course explores these questions by looking at a variety of theoretical essays, novels, films, and other cultural texts. Queer Histories SCA-UA 475 Offered every other year. 4 points. Does history matter in contemporary queer politics? Does the history of marriage as an institution make any difference in the fight over gay marriage? Do histories of medieval gender-crossing matter for transgender politics today? Do the historical legacies of the racial politics of public health shape organizing for HIV prevention and treatment around the world today? In this mid-level seminar, we will explore the different meanings and uses of queer history. These histories will be critically examined within a global context, and related to histories of modernity, capitalism and imperialism. Students will also consider the significance of historical hierarchies of race, gender, class and nation in interaction with histories of sexuality. Topics include cultures and subcultures, sexual practices and meanings, legal regulation, science/biology, public policy, politics and activism.
