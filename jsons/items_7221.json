The School's first-ever benefit gala in Los Angeles, honoring and embracing our West Coast alumni, parents, industry friends and Dean's Council members was held on November 9, 2004. Dean's Council members Bernie Brillstein, Iris Cantor, Chris Columbus, Martha Coolidge, Brad Grey, Maurice Kanbar, Jillian Manus-Salzman, Laurence Mark, Jack Rapke, Brett Ratner, Steve Tisch and Casey Wasserman were each presented with the Big Apple Award. The honorees were introduced in a musical medley modeled on A Chorus Line , with twenty Tisch Undergraduate Drama students from the Cap21 program singing and dancing in an \"audition\" for the Dean's Council. Steve Tisch spoke on behalf of all honorees, and Debra Messing introduced Jerry Seinfeld for an original comedy routine that delighted the audience.    The evening was a tremendous success, raising almost $500,000 for student scholarships. NancyJane Goldston and her team of alumni, and Cheri Lauterbach and her parent committee contributed time, energy and generous resources to ensure a terrific turnout and an auspicious West Coast debut for the School. Leadership also came from the Honorary Chairs Dustin and Lisa Hoffman, Wanda and Al Ruddy and Cindy and Alan Horn.   Tisch LA Gala Photo Gallery  Executive Director, External Affairs Andrew I.
