ECT doctoral students are trained in cognitive science, the learning sciences, game studies, and design-based methodologies to conduct original research on how technology and media can support learning. Students can also participate in our design-oriented studio-based learning courses, and are encouraged to combine theoretical research with design and practice in appropriate learning contexts. The program is highly selective and fully funded for full-time students.

Our programs are unique in their focus across broad learning contexts and in the linkage between design and research (including our studio-based learning approach).    Our master's in Digital Media Design for Learning and Advanced Certificate in Digital Media Design for Learning (formerly Educational Communication and Technology) prepare students to create, use, and evaluate media and technology for learning, from software and websites, to games, video and mobile phone applications. The master's in Games for Learning prepares students to create, use and evaluate serious games for learning and social change. The PhD in Educational Communication and Technology prepares world-class scholars to theorize and study the relationship between design, media, technology, and learning in a variety of paradigms: from social science, to design, to humanistic and cultural studies.
