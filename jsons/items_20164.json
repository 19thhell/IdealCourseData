To remain in good standing, you must satisfy the following requirements, in addition to the School of Engineering requirements for a minimum term and cumulative 2.0 GPA in all courses:     An average of C (2.0) or better in all MG courses   A course in which the grade of I is received may not be used to satisfy any prerequisites until the incomplete is resolved     Course Distribution     60 credits in management   34 credits in courses in humanities and social sciences   10 credits in courses in mathematics   10 credits in &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; electives chosen from math, science, social sciences and humanities   6 credits in science   4 credits in computer science   3 credits in a &ldquo;technical&rdquo; elective   1 credit in the Engineering and Technology Forum     See the Typical Course Schedule for an example of what your schedule might look like as a student in the BTM program. (About course numbering .)   Currently, management courses for the BS in BTM are each 4 credits. This new curriculum accommodates 3-credit courses in humanities and social sciences, as well as 3-credit courses in the sciences.   Concentrations   You may focus your study in 1 of 2 areas of concentration, which focus on particular issues and strategies that apply to business and technology management:     Technology Innovation Strategy enables you to develop effective skills for conducting strategic analysis addressing marketing, logistics, channel, and operations management issues, as well as relevant best business practiced in the technological arena. In this concentration option, you will complete MG 3304 in your 6 th semester and MG 4004 in your 7 th semester.   Technology and Innovation in Finance will prepare you to understand financial theory and how firms use modern finance for strategic and tactical decision-making. In this concentration option, you will complete MG 3214 and MG 4204 in your 6 th and 7 th semesters.     Honors Capstone (Including Thesis and Honor&#39;s Thesis)   If you earn a 3.6 GPA or better in MG courses through your junior year of study, you will qualify for an optional MG4904 BS Thesis in Business and Technology Management honors capstone. You are advised to meet with the BTM Program Director before completing you junior year if you qualify. (You are free to not elect this project sequence.)   Transfer Students   Courses at other schools may or may not be granted transfer credit and require an evaluation of the content and level of material covered. Periodic reevaluation of courses at other institutions may lead to a variation in the number of credits granted from year-to-year. Thus, students completing the same program, but in different years, may receive different amounts of transfer credit. Transfer students must present their records for evaluation at least 2 weeks before the regular registration period for their first semester.   Minor in Management   You may obtain an undergraduate minor in management by completing 14 credits of management courses with an overall GPA of at least 2.0 in the classes, one of which must be MG1002. Additionally, you must take at least 8 of the 14 credits at the School of Engineering.   Course Numbering   BTM courses are numbered with the following schema:     The first digit of a course number corresponds to the year in which a BTM student would take the course (1 = freshman, etc.)   The second digit reflects the primary nature of the course material. Courses numbered with a second digit of &ldquo;0&rdquo; are focused primarily on processes in management     &ldquo;1&rdquo; are oriented toward organizational behavior   &ldquo;2&rdquo; are quantitative in nature   &ldquo;3&rdquo; describe a firm&rsquo;s relationships with external forces   &ldquo;4&rdquo; study innovation   &ldquo;5&rdquo; are capstone courses   &ldquo;6&rdquo; are Internship and Service courses   Thus, MG 3304 Introduction to Supply Chain Management is a 4-credit junior-year course focusing on external relationships.
