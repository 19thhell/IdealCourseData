NYU students reflect this diversity; they arrive from all over the country and the world not only to find themselves and \u201cmake it\u201d here, but to teach\u2014and learn from\u2014each other (not to mention build amazing friendships along the way). This makes student life at NYU a remarkable, life-changing experience unlike that at many other colleges.           Students at NYU are in the unique position to experience a college lifestyle in a city setting. NYU offers many of the essential activities that are traditionally associated with college student life, and its location in the heart of New York City creates a setting that presents a myriad of non-traditional opportunities that will supplement and accentuate the student life experience.     While here, students can join a fraternity or sorority. They can join one of our sports teams: NYU athletics range from intramural soccer to varsity fencing. They can develop and engage in a diverse, personal spiritual life. Academy Award winning directors and prize winning writers have honed their craft in NYU classrooms. Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets. From Washington Square News to WNYU Radio to Tisch film courses, NYU students take advantage of New York City as a global center for media, journalism and communications.

Students can live in residential housing near the Washington Square campus\u2014soaking in the vibrant Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014or they can live off campus in one of the five boroughs and beyond. With either option, students aren\u2019t just residents of a college campus; they are citizens, users and a vital aspect of one of the world\u2019s largest, diverse, most interesting cities.     As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this. An NYU education is an experience like no other: diverse, cosmopolitan, vibrant and rich. NYU students do not just become well-rounded college graduates, but accomplished global citizens.

Off campus, professors bring the experience they have as researchers and active professionals to their students. In addition to teaching, they serve as advisers to city government, banks, and school systems; consultants to museums and corporations; and working artists, choreographers, and film directors. Their professional experience informs their style of teaching and encourages students to make use of the extraordinary resources of the city through networking, research, internships, part-time jobs, and service learning.       On campus, NYU offers countless way to connect with other members of the University community. With over 400 student clubs and organizations, hundreds of sports and residence hall activities, guest lectures and film screenings, and city excursions and community service opportunities, students get involved with the University, with their college, in their residence hall, and most important, with each other.     Students and faculty have access to an exceptional range of facilities, services, residence halls, and dining locations. Academic facilities include nine libraries as well as dozens of specialized centers and institutes. Everyone has access to advanced computer resources and specialized offices that address almost every need\u2014from medical attention to discount theatre tickets.

NYU students reflect this diversity; they arrive from all over the country and the world not only to find themselves and \u201cmake it\u201d here, but to teach\u2014and learn from\u2014each other (not to mention build amazing friendships along the way). This makes student life at NYU a remarkable, life-changing experience unlike that at many other colleges.           Students at NYU are in the unique position to experience a college lifestyle in a city setting. NYU offers many of the essential activities that are traditionally associated with college student life, and its location in the heart of New York City creates a setting that presents a myriad of non-traditional opportunities that will supplement and accentuate the student life experience.     While here, students can join a fraternity or sorority. They can join one of our sports teams: NYU athletics range from intramural soccer to varsity fencing. They can develop and engage in a diverse, personal spiritual life. Academy Award winning directors and prize winning writers have honed their craft in NYU classrooms. Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets. From Washington Square News to WNYU Radio to Tisch film courses, NYU students take advantage of New York City as a global center for media, journalism and communications.                                                           Student Resource Center                                                                                         NYU TV & Media                                                                                         Spiritual Life at NYU                                            Student living at NYU is a unique experience of its own. Students can live in residential housing near the Washington Square campus\u2014soaking in the vibrant Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014or they can live off campus in one of the five boroughs and beyond. With either option, students aren\u2019t just residents of a college campus; they are citizens, users and a vital aspect of one of the world\u2019s largest, diverse, most interesting cities.     As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this. An NYU education is an experience like no other: diverse, cosmopolitan, vibrant and rich. NYU students do not just become well-rounded college graduates, but accomplished global citizens.

Albeit untraditional, NYU is primarily located in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village and downtown Brooklyn where there\u2019s no doubt that the neighborhoods feel like a community. Many of NYU\u2019s academic and administrative buildings and freshman residence halls border Washington Square Park. The sidewalks are full of students on their way to class, and members of the NYU community fill the restaurants, shops, and other businesses.
