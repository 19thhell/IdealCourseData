Urban life is a   constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New   York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual   frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the   ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the   Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance,   particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat   of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and   the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of   political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world   communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and   urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle,   Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de   Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now   becoming visible.  ITAL-UA 115 Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature Tuesday/Thursday 9:30am-10:45am, CASA Library Instructor TBD Conducted in Italian , (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission)  Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from   its origins to 17th century.     ITAL-UA 148 Giordano Bruno and the Art of Memory (same as HIST-UA 126) Tuesday 12:30pm-3:15pm, CASA Library Cipani Conducted in English The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the Italian Renaissance. Far more than a mere tool for passive retention of information: memory devices had the ambition to assist in the structuring of thought, the organization of knowledge, the solving of philosophical questions, and were intended also as tools for creative output. This course examines the impact of the pervasive culture of memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the interdependence between textual and visual codes. A main focus will be on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno, burnt at stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe and of nature's creative principles. We will first examine Bruno's works explicitly devoted to memory, assessing elements of continuity and innovation with respect to the tradition. Subsequently, sampling Bruno's Italian dialogues, his writings on magic, and his satyrical comedy Candlebearer, we will look for intersections between his theory of memory, on the one hand, and his strategy of self-representation, his literary style, and his doctrine of infinity on the other. ITAL-UA 164 Italian Colonialism (same as HIST-UA 204, EURO-UA 161) Monday 9:30am-12:15pm, CASA Library Ben-Ghiat Conducted in English ITAL-UA 172 Topics: Narrating Immigrant Experience Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA Library Lakhous Conducted in English How can we narrate immigration today? Can we argue that the immigrant experience is universal? How can we recount family memories of immigration? What is the relationship between identity and memory? What are the connections between immigration, emigration, and colonialism? We will attempt to answer such questions \u2013 and to approach different narratives of immigrant experience \u2013 through novels, films, documentaries, and essays. We will examine cases in different national and cultural contexts. We will look in particular at the Italian case; for, Italy represents a unique case in the world: after decades of exporting immigrants, it has become an importer. But we will also examine other histories and experiences (whether in China, Vietnam, Tunisia, France, Romania, the USA, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and others); internal migration (especially to the North of Italy in the fifties and the sixties); and finally non-European Community immigrants.  ITAL-UA 173 Topics in Italian Culture: Medieval Italy Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm, CASA Library Vise Conducted in English Medieval Italy can look like a land replete with impossible contradiction. The northern cities witnessed Europe\u2019s first stirrings of formal republican self-governance since the Fall of Rome but also the violent repression of political dissenters; the flowering of vernacular literature in writers like Petrarca, Dante and Boccaccio but also the highest levels of Latinity in Europe; the development of systems of justice to which modern institutions trace their origin but also notoriously bloody factional violence and vendetta; the boom of a mercantile economy but also wildly popular grassroots religious critiques of wealth. In one city we find the first broad-based emancipation of slaves and serfs in the West while in another, the brutal exclusion of the turbulent lower-class guild of wool carders from political life. They were the \u201ccities of God\u201d where sometimes heretics ruled. The Mezzogiorno, southern Italy, glittered with literary and artistic achievement and bustled with ethnic and religious diversity under the succession of multiple foreign monarchies. And in the middle, the Papal States staggered in competition with the powers of the North, the South, and its own squabbling aristocracy. Yet at the same time, its ruler claimed a monopoly on the souls of European Christians and operated the highest court of appeals for major European legal disputes. In this class, we will explore this complex culture by looking at a wide range of primary sources from poetry to prisoner graffiti, high and low art, and complimentary secondary sources. The course will begin with the early medieval period and the emergence of the communes, Papal states, and Southern Kingdom after the fall of Rome and then proceed thematically to conclude by considering what this period bequeathed to subsequent generations. For each theme, our central question will remain: were these deep contrasts ultimately a source of strength and creativity or of chaos and division? Topics to be covered include: legal and extra-legal justice, religious plurality, politics and religion, women and gender, wealth and poverty, intellectual life, art and patronage, factions and la familia , and the creation of state.  ITAL-UA 174 Italian Films, Italian Histories I (same as DRLIT-UA 503, EURO-UA 173) Tuesday, 12:30pm-3:15pm &amp; Thursday 12:30pm-1:45pm CASA Auditorium Albertini Conducted in English Sample Syll abus  Films are responsible for creating a national identity more than any other medium of communication. Cinematography has played a much more prominent role in the construction of a common popular history in Italy, than in other European states, given the relatively young age of the unified Italian nation. From the papier-mach\u00e9 buildings of ancient Rome presented in the very first Italian movies to the powerful non-professional actors of neorealistic cinema representing the Nazi occupation of the peninsula; these are the images that for generations of Italians represent Italian History, much more than the fading memories of high-school textbooks or of high-brow intellectual debates rigorously kept in the seldom read pages of national newspapers. The purpose of this course (that is ideally completed by \"Italian Films, Italian Histories II\" taught by Professor Ben-Ghiat in the Spring) is to provide a general but accurate overview of Italian history and a critical analysis of its representation through films from the origins to the Risorgimento. This (first) course is devoted to Roman, Medieval, and Renaissance history and it closes with a rather in-depth presentation of different accounts of the Risorgimento (the process of Italian unification). ITAL-UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy (same as COLIT-UA 270, ENGL-UA 142, MEDI-UA 271) Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm, CASA Auditorium Conducted in English   SPRING 2015  ITAL-UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature  Tuesday/Thursday 9:30am-10:45am, CASA 201 Antonangeli Conducted in Italian , (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission) Introductory-level literature course that, through a close reading of   authors such as Alfieri, Foscolo, Leopardi, Manzoni, Verga, D'Annunzio,   Moravia, and Calvino, focuses on how to understand a literary text in   Italian. Covers Italian literature from the 18th century to the   contemporary period. ITAL-UA 121 The Renaissance (same as HIST-UA 121, MEDI-UA 121) Tuesday/Thursday 3:30pm-4:45pm, TISC LC9 Appuhn Conducted in English ITAL-UA 172 Hellscapes and Elysia in the Renaissance and Beyond (same as COLIT-UA 173, ENGL-UA 56, MEDI-UA 172) Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm, CASA 201 McHugh Conducted in English Syllabus  This course explores various representations of otherworlds, both infernal and paradisal: the realms of the afterlife, regions of marvel or idyllic bliss, political utopias and dystopias. Readings and discussion focus on how these imagined lands reflect, critique, and animate the real world, from antiquity through our own times.  ITAL-UA 173.001 Murder, Italian Style! (same as DRLIT-UA 505) Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA 201 Falkoff Course conducted in English; reading knowledge of Italian recommended but not required. A genre whose development is associated with urbanization, crime fiction\u2014like so many other emblems of modernity\u2014is often considered to have arrived belatedly in Italy. Despite this initial reticence, several critically acclaimed writers of contemporary Italy have used the genre as a narrative space from which to launch a broader commentary on aspects of Italian history and culture such as the fascist period, honor killings, police brutality, political corruption, femicide, and xenophobia. This course will consider novels, plays, and films from the 1950s to the present, analyzing the ways in which they use conventions of the crime fiction as a point of departure for literary experimentation, philosophical reflection, and cultural critique. ITAL-UA 173.002 Italy and the Mediterranean: Empire, Politics and Culture (same as AHSEM-UA 218.001 and MEIS-UA 659.001) Tuesday/Thursday 4:55pm-6:10pm, CASA 306 Valerie McGuire Conducted in English NOTE: ONLY OPEN TO CAS SOPHOMORES, JUNIORS, AND SENIORS Shortly after its unification in 1861, the Italian nation began a prolonged attempt to establish an overseas empire on a scale with other European colonial powers. This course examines how Italian imperialism unfolded and how it impacted politics and culture on the global level, as well as how it shaped internal attitudes and beliefs, particularly during Italy\u2019s Fascist period. The course studies the formation of Italy\u2019s national project under two different empires and discovers how processes such as emigration and the Southern Question intertwined with its first attempts to establish foreign colonies. As Ottoman collapse and the First World War initiated a new phase of European colonialism, Italy turned to the Mediterranean as the domain of its empire. We investigate how the Mediterranean region ignited fantasies of the exotic and the familiar and how it both promoted and challenged Italian myths of national identity. The course studies Italy\u2019s imperial history and culture through a range of medium, including film, novels and scholarly articles. Reading knowledge in Italian is a plus but not a requisite. ITAL-UA 282 Italian Cinema and Literature Tuesday 12:30-1:45pm and Thursday 12:30-3:15pm CASA Auditorium Albertini Course conducted in Italian (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission) Sample Syllabus The course will focus on the development of Italian cinema in the post war period, emphasizing the relationship between literature and film adaptation. The books and the films will offer a unique opportunity to analyze and discuss crucial issues related to the historical, political, and cultural evolution of Italy concentrating in particular on the political unification process (Risorgimento). ITAL-UA 285 Topics in Italian Literature: Dante's Purgatorio (same as ENGL-UA 52 and MEDI-UA 285.001) Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA 201 Conducted in English ITAL-UA 724 Italian-American Life in Literature (same as ENGL-UA 724) Tuesday/Thursday 11am-12:15pm, CASA 201 Hendin Conducted in English Sample Syllabus A   study of the fiction and poetry through which Italian American writers   have expressed their heritage and their engagement in American life.   From narratives of immigration to current work by \"assimilated\" writers,   the course explores the depiction of Italian American identity.   Challenging stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships,   sexual mores, and political and social concerns. ITAL-UA 760 Topics in the Renaissance: Visual Languages of the Renaissance: Emblems, Dreams, Hieroglyphs (same as MEDI-UA 760.001) Thursday 12:30pm-3:00pm, CASA 201 Cipani Conducted in English Syllabus Making knowledge visible was one of the great Renaissance endeavors. Some of the period's most characteristic products were born out of the conviction that concepts could be systematically turned into images \u2014 and that such images could be organized into a visual language, more profound and universal than discursive logic. Egyptian hieroglyphs and dream visions, in their mysterious graphic exuberance, were considered typical vehicles of this advanced mode of communication. The desire to emulate their symbolic density is reflected both in literature and in art, often in ways that challenge common distinctions between visual and verbal communication. In this course you will be introduced to an assortment of works representative of such interplay between text and image: emblem books, dream books and dream-centered works, hieroglyphic inventions and studies, collections of proverbs, iconology manuals, etc. Among the books examined are some widely considered as the finest examples of design in the history of printing. Early modern and recent theory of emblems will also be discussed. As a present-day counterpart of Renaissance emblems, the course will conclude with a survey of corporate logos and Russian criminal tattoos. CORE-UA 554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Tuesday/Thursday 12:30-1:45PM FALL 2014  CORE-UA 400-70 Texts and Ideas: Visible and Invisible Cities Tuesday/Thursday 11:00am-12:15pm, CASA Auditorium Cox Sample Syllabus The experience of living in a city is one vital thread that connects us with our ancient, medieval, and early modern ancestors, and that continues to provide a unifying element in millions of our contemporaries\u2019 disparate lives across the globe. Urban life is a constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance, particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle, Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now becoming visible. ITAL-UA 115 Readings in Medieval &amp; Renaissance Literature CANCELED ITAL-UA 165 Italian Fascism (same as HIST-UA 171) Monday 11am-1:45pm Ben-Ghiat Conducted in English Syllabus This interdisciplinary course examines the dictatorship that ruled Italy between 1922 and 1943. We address the relationship between culture and politics, public and private; Fascist biopolitics; anti-Fascism; fascist colonialism and racism; the cult of Mussolini; and Fascist-era feminities and masculinities. We will combine secondary sources with readings of Fascist speeches and anti-Fascist novels, and viewings of newsreels and Fascist war films. The course is conducted in English, and most of the readings are in English. ITAL-UA 166 Contemporary Italy (same as EURO-UA 164) Tuesday/Thursday 12:30pm-1:45pm Albertini Conducted in English Covers the political, cultural, economic, and social history of Italy since World War II. Starting with the transition from fascism to democracy, examines the Cold War, the growth of a mass consumer society, the social and political movements of the late 1960s and 1970s, the battle against the Mafia, postwar emigration, the rise and fall of postwar Christian Democracy and Italian communism, and the emergence of new parties in the 1990s such as Berlusconi's Forza Italia, Bossi's Northern League, and Fini's neofascist Alleanza Nazionale. ITAL-UA 172 Portraits of Women: From 19th to 20th Century Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm Ducci Conducted in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30 Advanced Review of Modern Italian) The purpose of this class is to understand the changing image and voice of Italian women in a period of intense change from traditionalism to modernity. The course is based on a choice of short texts in Italian, selected for their relevance and accessible language, combined with images and visual material taken from painting, photography, fashion, theater, and film. The emphasis is on improving skills of reading and communication in Italian, while at the same time discussing the history of gender and its politics in a country where the struggle between tradition and change often invests the image and life of women. ITAL-UA 173 Violence and Memory in Contemporary Italy Tuesday/Thursday 2:00-3:15pm Forgacs Conducted in English Sample Syllabus Acts of violence, against individuals or groups of people, have played an important part in the collective memory of Italy after Fascism. However, they have also been open to conflicting interpretations. Was the execution of Mussolini and Clara Petacci and the public desecration of their corpses in Milan in 1945 an act of legitimate retribution for the sufferings inflicted by the Fascist regime and its alliance with Nazi Germany or an act that displaced Italians\u2019 collective guilt over acquiescence? Were the bullets and bombs of the \u201canni di piombo\u201d from 1969 to 1980 assaults on the fabric of a democratic society or symptoms of a malfunctioning political system and civil society? Did the collective mourning of mafia victims in the 1990s allow attention to be turned away from collusion between politicians and organized crime? Why are some massacres well known and publicly commemorated and others largely removed from collective memory? This course takes five cases where violence has given rise to these kinds of controversy and debate over historical memory. ITAL-UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm Freccero Conducted in English Sample Syllabus Students study The Divine Comedy both as a mirror of high medieval culture and as a unique text that breaks out of its cultural bounds. The entire poem is read, in addition to selections from the Vita Nuova and other complementary minor works. ITAL-UA 285-001 Love in the Renaissance: From Lyric to Letters Wednesday 11am-1:45pm Bolzoni Conducted in English, Readings in Italian . Love is one of the central themes of the Renaissance literature. The course is aimed to investigate how such topic is represented and discussed in different literary genres: poetry, theatre, letters, chivalric poems. Special attention will be paid to the representation of passions and the figure of woman. During the course, a number of texts will be read: compositions of women poets, such as Gaspara Stampa and Isabella di Morra, will be analysed; among the theatre pieces, La Mandragola by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli; as far as letters are concerned, students will investigate the epistolary exchange between Pietro Bembo and Maria Savorgnan; finally, regarding the chivalric poems, episodes from Orlando innamorato of Matteo M. Boiardo and Orlando furioso of Ludovico Ariosto will be analysed. Moreover, the reading of a number of love poems by Michelangelo will represent an occasion for investigating the intertwining links between literature and figurative arts. ITAL-UA 285-002 Ecologies of Italian Literature Monday/Wednesday 2pm-3:15pm CANCELED ITAL-UA 861 Past and Present Stories of Italian Immigration Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm Marazzi Syllabus Conducted in English This course provides a cultural approach to the history of the adaptation of Italian immigrants to American culture and society, and compares it with the present change occurring in Italy, in the light of an unprecedented inbound immigration. The epical phenomenon of the Italian mass migration to the U.S. will be examined using immigrants\u2019 words as primary sources \u2013 analyzing novels, poetry, \u201ccolonial\u201d journalism and theatre, and private letters \u2013 with a keen attention to cases of bilingualism and code-mixing.                            SPRING 2014  \u2028ITAL-UA 30 Advanced Review of Modern Italian Section 001 - TWR 11:00am-12:15pm Section 002 - TWR 2:00pm-3:15pm Anderson-Tirro Taught in Italian Prerequisite: Intermediate Italian II (ITAL-UA 12), or Intensive Intermediate Italian (ITAL-UA 20), or placement exam.

With the help of opera adaptations, recreations, popularizations, quotes, etc, operatic plots and settings will be linked thematically to present day issues, leading to discussion on contemporary social and cultural perspectives. Opera\u2019s unique mixture of word, gesture, and music will offer students a great opportunity to internalize the language and acquire fluency. \u2028ITAL-UA 110 Translation TWR 12:30pm-1:45pm Marchelli Taught in Italian Prerequisites: Advanced Review of Modern Italian (ITAL-UA 30) and one of the following: ITAL-UA 101, ITAL-UA 103, ITAL-UA 105, or ITAL-UA 107, or permission of the department. Introduces students to the theory and practice of translation. While engaging in the craft of translation firsthand, students gain a deeper understanding of the Italian language through the study of contemporary texts, such as Italian novels and short stories. The course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension, as well as written expression. A special emphasis is on the analysis of dialogue, style, and linguistic choices of each author, in order to explore the development of the written language, slang, regional expressions, and linguistic differences that have accompanied and defined the evolution of Italian over the past 20 years. ITAL-UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature (same as COLIT-UA 141) MW 9:30-10:45am Lucchi Taught in Italian Sample Syllabus Introductory-level literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as Alfieri, Foscolo, Leopardi, Manzoni, Verga, D'Annunzio, Moravia, and Calvino, focuses on how to understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from the 18th century to the contemporary period. ITAL-UA 147 Machiavelli (same as MEDI-147) TR 2:00pm-3:15pm Albertini The inventor of modern political science, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli is one of the most original thinkers in the history of Western civilization. In this course, Machiavelli's political, historical, and theatrical works are read in the context in which they were conceived\u2014the much tormented and exciting Florence of the 15th and early 16th centuries, struggling between republican rule and the magnificent tyranny of the Medici family. ITAL-UA 160 Dante and His World (same as COLIT-UA 173, ENGL-UA 143 and MEDI-UA 801) MW 12:30pm-1:45pm Ardizzone                           Interdisciplinary introduction to late medieval culture, using Dante, its foremost literary artist, as a focus. Attention is directed to literature, art, and music, in addition to political, religious, and social developments of the time.

Readings include selections from Dante\u2019s works as The New Life, The Divine Comedy, The Monarchy along with texts by St. Augustine, Severinus Boethius, St. Francis , Brunetto Latini, Thomas Aquinas, Boccaccio. Works of vernacular poets of 13th century and artists from Romanesque to Gothic will be considered. The course will be given in English. ITAL-UA 173 Visions on and of Mafia MW 2:00-3:15PM Montalbano From its local origins in Sicily, the Mafia has become a global phenomenon and a widespread model of organized crime that threatens and corrupts the international economy, political systems, and social environments. Though its power and underworld affect legal business, control illegal traffic, and trample human rights, nevertheless film, television, and literature stimulate a continued fascination with a romantic and even heroic vision of the Mafia. In this seminar we will explore and compare American and Italian films on the Mafia and the literary texts upon which many of them are based from the late 1940s to today. Combining the analyses of historians, sociologists, and intellectuals, along with the testimonies of victims, we will not only challenge the stereotypes through which cultural productions envision the Mafiosi but also, and more importantly, we will shift the inquiry to how the Mafiosi envision the world by asking: What is the ideology of Mafia? How do Mafiosi picture society, human beings, and law? Does Mafia have its own ethic? How does a religious imaginary shape a Mafia worldview? How does Mafia\u2019s normative discourse govern the performance of femininity, masculinity, and homosexuality? Can we consider Mafia to be terrorism? Examining together the visions on and of Mafia through cultural, socio-political, and historical perspectives, this seminar aims to deconstruct the mythological eye and instead form an analytical eye with which to investigate and understand the Mafioso universe and power. ITAL-UA 175 Italian Films, Italian Histories II (same as HIST-UA 176, CINE-UT 235, DRLIT-UA 506) M 11:00am-12:15pm; W 11:00am-1:45pm Ben-Ghiat Studies representations  of Italian history from the unification of Italy to the present  through the medium of film. We explore the possibilities and  limitations of feature films for the representation of history, and  ask: What happens when history becomes cinema and when cinema takes  on history? ITAL-UA 274 Pirandello and the  Contemporary Theatre   (same as DRLIT-UA 280) TR 9:30am-10:45am Oliver   An introduction to  Luigi Pirandello's major plays as they relate to the foundation of  contemporary theatre. Attention is also paid to grotesque and  futurist drama. Works studied include Sei personaggio in cerca  d'autore, Cosi \u00e8 (se vi pare), and Enrico IV. ITAL-UA 724 Italian-American Life in Literature (same as ENGL-UA 724) TR 11am-12:15pm Hendin A study of the fiction and poetry through which Italian American writers have expressed their heritage and their engagement in American life. From narratives of immigration to current work by \"assimilated\" writers, the course explores the depiction of Italian American identity. Challenging stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships, sexual mores, and political and social concerns. ITAL-UA 760-001 Giordano Bruno &amp; the Art of Memory (same as MEDI-UA 760-001) TR 12:30pm-1:45pm Cipani The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the Italian Renaissance. Far more than a mere tool for passive retention of information: memory devices had the ambition to assist in the structuring of thought, the organization of knowledge, the solving of philosophical questions, and were intended also as tools for creative output. This course examines the impact of the pervasive culture of memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the interdependence between textual and visual codes. A main focus will be on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno, burnt at stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe and of nature's creative principles. Sampling the varied textual genres of Bruno's work (philosophical dialogues, writings on magic, a satirical comedy), one of the questions this course aims to answer is the same posed to Bruno by Henry III King of France: is the Art of Memory acquired \"by magic\" or \"by science\"? ITAL-UA 760-002 Humanism in the Renaissance (same as MEDI-UA 760-002) MW 11:00am-12:15pm Freccero  FALL 2013  ITAL UA 115 Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature  MW 9:30-10:45am,  Casa Library  Taught in Italian  (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30; Same as MEDI 115) Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from   its origins to 17th century.   ITAL-UA 142 - The Courtesan in Renaissance Culture &amp; Society Cox TR 11-12:30pm, Casa Library Examines an intriguing figure within the social panorama of Renaissance Italy, the \"honest courtesan\" or cortigiana onesta. It contextualizes courtesans' social position and cultural status, embracing elements of social history, literary history, and music and art history. Texts studied include both representations of courtesans, such as the notorious dialogues of Pietro Aretino, and writings by courtesan poets, such as Tullia d'Aragona and Veronica Franco.  ITAL UA 173-001 Topics in Italian Culture: Media, Society and Politics in Italy: Since 1943  Forgacs TR 2-3:15pm, Casa Library The course aims to give students a good understanding of how the mass media and popular cultural forms have interacted with social change and political power in Italy from the fall of Fascism to the present. Some observers have seen postwar Italy as following a relatively normal pattern of evolution of the mass media within a democratic polity, whereas others have seen Italy as exceptional, among the western democracies, both for the degree of political interferences with the media and, since the later 1990s, for the breakdown of democratic norms. This course will enable students to assess these views in an informed way. It will also allow them to consider how far the media should be seen as mirrors of social change and how far were they themselves agents of change. The course will cover some of the most significant moments and turning points in the political and social history of the period, using contemporary sources and documents from various media.   ITAL UA 174 Italian Films, Italian Histories I Albertini T 12:30-3:15pm; R 12:30-1:45pm, Casa Auditorium  Studies representation of Italian history through the medium of film from ancient Rome through the Risorgimento. Issues to be covered throughout include the use of filmic history as a means of forging national identity.  ITAL UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy in Translation Freccero MW 11-12:15pm Casa Auditorium (same as MEDI 271, COLIT 270, ENGL 142)  Students   study the Divine Comedy both as a mirror of high medieval culture and   as a unique text that breaks out of its cultural bounds. The entire poem   is read, in addition to selections from the Vita Nuova and other   complementary minor works.  ITAL UA 271 Boccaccio's Decameron  Ardizzone MW 2:00-3:15pm, Casa Library A study of Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron with particular emphasis on themes, conceptual innovations, and influences on French and English literatures. ITAL-UA 285 Topics in Italian Literature: Food in Italian Literature and Culture - The Art of Taste, The Taste of Nation: Italian Literary and Cinematic Gastronomy Falkoff TR 12:30-1:45pm, Casa Library Casa Library Sample Syllabus \u201cWhat is the glory of Dante compared to spaghetti?\u201d Italian journalist Giuseppe Prezzolini famously asks in his 1954 history of pasta. While numerous cookbooks cite Prezzolini to evoke Italy\u2019s consummate culinary achievements, this course instead poses the question: \u201cWhat is the glory of spaghetti compared to its representation in literature and film?\u201d We begin the semester with short stories by Giovanni Boccaccio in which the preparation and consumption of food becomes a critical act of communication. Turning to films, novels, memoirs, cookbooks, and manifestos from the late nineteenth century to the present, we will reflect upon the narrative functions of elaborate descriptions of culinary triumphs. Do such descriptions constitute a form of \u201cfood-porn\u201d? If so, how is the project of reading and interpreting the texts changed? We will also ask what ideological work is performed by literary gastronomy; and how it contributes to the production of national, regional, and local identities, and socioeconomic differences.   SUMMER 2013  Six-Week Session 1 (May 28-July 5) ITAL-UA 10 Intensive Elementary Italian Instructors: Nicola Lucchi, Wayne Clinger M-F, 9AM-12PM  Six-Week Session 2 (July 8-August 16) ITAL-UA 20 Intensive Intermediate Italian Instructors: Jennifer Newman, Melissa Swain M-F, 9AM-12PM ITAL-UA 173 Italian Crimes, Italian Fictions Instructor: Franco Baldasso Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2PM-5PM The history of Italian culture hides a proliferation of murky stories. Admired literary representations from Dante\u2019s Inferno to Machiavellian politicians, and the cinematic allure of criminal organizations such as mafia or camorra, are only some of the reasons why Italy stands out in the global imagination today also for its crimes, its mysteries and its alluring sinners. Through crime fiction, writers and filmmakers analyze, criticize, and unveil the violence of politics, the complexity of Italian history and its difficult modernization, the collective traumas and the conformism of a society always eager to find a scapegoat for its vices. This course aims to shed new light on modern Italian culture and society through the perspective of the books and films illuminating this dark side. Crime fiction in Italy has a specific name, \u201cil giallo\u201d, from the color of the covers of the popular books that invaded Italian market. \u201cI gialli\u201d are not only a literary genre \u2013 many groundbreaking movies featuring prominent Italian actors and directors, from Mastroianni to Volont\u00e9, share the name. The genre is a major player in Italian self-representation even beyond Hollywood clich\u00e9s. The course will approach modern Italian novels, from Moravia to Sciascia, and their filmic adaptations tackling issues such as the fascist mentality, the evolution of mafia as a modern global enterprise, political terrorism, social and gender exclusion\u2013\u2013looking at what is behind enduring stereotypes about Italians.  SPRING 2013  ITAL UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature Ziegler TR 9:30-10:45AM, Casa Libary Taught in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30) Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from   its origins to 17th century.     ITAL UA 166 Contemporary Italy: Identities, Society, and Culture Albertini TR 2-3:15PM, Casa Library Taught in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30) Covers the political,  cultural, economic, and social history of Italy since World War II.  Starting with the transition from fascism to democracy, examines the  Cold War, the growth of a mass consumer society, the social and  political movements of the late 1960s and 1970s, the battle against  the Mafia, postwar emigration, the rise and fall of postwar Christian  Democracy and Italian communism, and the emergence of new parties in  the 1990s such as Berlusconi's Forza Italia, Bossi's Northern  League, and Fini's neofascist Alleanza Nazionale.    ITAL UA 173-001 Topics in Italian Culture: Verdi's Contexts Izzo TR 11-12:15PM, Casa Auditorium This   course addresses the intersection of art and ideology in Italy,   Germany, Spain, France, and the Soviet Union, during the period   1914-1968. In each instance, we will examine the tensions between   cultures of fascism and anti- fascism ,   both visual and verbal. Addressing the development of fascist ideology   and its relationship to culture, our focus will shift from Futurist   proto-fascist incitements to nationalist war and colonialism, to Dadaist   subversion of that same rhetoric, to the shifting and evolving tensions   of these forces throughout the period between the World Wars. Along the   way, we will examine the representational strategies of different   political systems (and their dissenters) in context: Nazi Germany,   Mussolini\u2019s Italy, Popular Front and Vichy France, Republican and   Franco\u2019s Spain, and (as a counterpoint) the post-revolutionary Soviet   Union. Addressing both the interventions of particular artists, as well   as broader issues of media and modernism, we will consider how the   struggle between fascism and anti- fascism    lies at the heart of twentieth-century culture. We will look at a   variety of media, objects, and texts: from film and photography, to   painting and exhibitions, to posters and spectacles, to poems and   manifestos. In each instance will consider some specific case studies,   whether the 1932 Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution or the 1937   Degenerate Art Exhibition in Nazi Germany.  ITAL UA 283 Other Worlds: Travel Literature in Italy Ferrari MW 2-3:15pm, Casa Library Ubiquitous   concepts - \"home,\" \"discovery,\" \"difference,\" - appear to be simple;   yet they mask complex literary and social themes. This course will   analyze how a voyage changes not only our conception of a given   destination, but also of our point of departure: of all the familiar   surroundings, signposts, and people that we recognize as \"home.\" Home is   then defined not simply as one's family and household but as all the   components that shape one's identity and sense of belonging, such as   nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, and gender. Every journey is   marked by displacement: a transformation that calls into question the   traveler's original position so that, to borrow Thomas Wolfe's phrase,   one can never \"go home again.\" This course will examine a selection of   Italian travel narratives within the context of contemporary   post-colonial theory. Questions to be addressed include: the relation   between power and the production of knowledge as it manifests itself in   such narratives; intertextuality and its ideological effects; modes of   representation of racial, cultural, historical, and sexual otherness.  ITAL UA 285-001 Tpcs in Italian Literature: Remapping Italian Cultural History: Private and Public Intellectuals in Italy from St. Francis to Boccaccio Ardizzone MW 12:30-1:45PM, Casa Library This course enlarges the range of texts offered in an undergraduate course on early modern Italian culture, including works less well known and not considered part of the canon. We begin by focusing on the notion of an intellectual as defined by both contemporary and non-contemporary historians or philosophers like J. Le Goff, A. De Libera, E. Said, A. Gramsci, and R. W. Emerson. The works of these authors will allow us to expand the notion of the intellectual and to introduce as intellectual every commitment resulting in a work useful to the public in the broadest sense. Dante\u2019s statement that being intellectual means knowing our proper goal or the aim of our actions introduces the idea that every human work is intellectually motivated either by being directed to the public or by being conceived in a private way. We therefore introduce the idea that both public and private intellectuals, directly or indirectly, collaborate in creating a work of collective use and identity. That a public intellectual must first be a private intellectual is our starting point. Under the category of intellectual we therefore list the sailors committed to making portolan charts and the mapmakers who devised instruments for practical knowledge.In the same way, we include the merchants who invented the single-double entry in bookkeeping. The figure of a saint like St. Francis of Assisi is part of the picture because he has advanced human freedom and awareness. The pilgrims who link devotion and travel enter the list, along with poets, writers, statesmen and masters of rhetoric, philosophers, craftsmen, and artists. Theory and pragmatism are considered in the course as deeply connected. Literary, philosophical culture is linked to technical scientific knowledge. Readings include works by St. Francis and St. Claire of Assisi, Marco Polo, Pier delle Vigne, Brunetto Latini, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, along with texts written by merchants and pilgrims. Works of artists from Romanesque to Gothic will be considered, as well as those of cartographers or makers of portolans. The course concludes by touching briefly on the culture of the Quattrocento and the new emerging model of the intellectual that is proposed, for example, in the Florentine culture of that time. The course will be given in English.

From   narratives of immigration to current work by \"assimilated\" writers, the   course explores the depiction of Italian American identity. Challenging   stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships, sexual mores,   and political and social concerns.  ITAL UA 760 Tpcs in Renaissance: Giordano Bruno and the Art of Memory  Cipani TR 12:30-1:45PM, Casa Library The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the   Italian Renaissance. Far more than a mere tool for passive retention of   information: memory devices had the ambition to assist in the   structuring of thought, the organization of knowledge, the solving of   philosophical questions, and were intended also as tools for creative   output. This course examines the impact of the pervasive culture of   memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the   interdependence between textual and visual codes. A main focus will be   on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno , burnt at   stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing   mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe and of   nature's creative principles. Sampling the varied textual genres of    Bruno 's work (philosophical dialogues, writings on magic, a satyrical   comedy), one of the questions this course aims to answer is the same   posed to Bruno by Henry III King of France: is the Art of Memory   acquired \"by magic\" or \"by science\"?

This course proposes and examination of Italian Americans as   represented in mainstream and independent American cinema, and later   television, from the silent era to the present. Particular attention   with be paid to the traditional stereotypes associated with these   representations (how they arose and why they continue to exist), two   specific genres -- the gangster film and the boxing film -- and how   Italian American filmmakers respond to and re-vision them  FALL 2012     ITAL UA 115 Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature Perna MW 9:30-10:45am Casa 201 Taught in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30; Same as MEDI 115) Introductory-level literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to understand a literary text in Italian.

Urban life is a   constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New   York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual   frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the   ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the   Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance,   particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat   of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and   the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of   political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world   communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and   urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle,   Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de   Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now   becoming visible.  ITAL-UA 115 Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature Tuesday/Thursday 9:30am-10:45am, CASA Library Instructor TBD Conducted in Italian , (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission)  Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from   its origins to 17th century.     ITAL-UA 148 Giordano Bruno and the Art of Memory (same as HIST-UA 126) Tuesday 12:30pm-3:15pm, CASA Library Cipani Conducted in English The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the Italian Renaissance. Far more than a mere tool for passive retention of information: memory devices had the ambition to assist in the structuring of thought, the organization of knowledge, the solving of philosophical questions, and were intended also as tools for creative output. This course examines the impact of the pervasive culture of memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the interdependence between textual and visual codes. A main focus will be on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno, burnt at stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe and of nature's creative principles. We will first examine Bruno's works explicitly devoted to memory, assessing elements of continuity and innovation with respect to the tradition. Subsequently, sampling Bruno's Italian dialogues, his writings on magic, and his satyrical comedy Candlebearer, we will look for intersections between his theory of memory, on the one hand, and his strategy of self-representation, his literary style, and his doctrine of infinity on the other. ITAL-UA 164 Italian Colonialism (same as HIST-UA 204, EURO-UA 161) Monday 9:30am-12:15pm, CASA Library Ben-Ghiat Conducted in English ITAL-UA 172 Topics: Narrating Immigrant Experience Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA Library Lakhous Conducted in English How can we narrate immigration today? Can we argue that the immigrant experience is universal? How can we recount family memories of immigration? What is the relationship between identity and memory? What are the connections between immigration, emigration, and colonialism? We will attempt to answer such questions \u2013 and to approach different narratives of immigrant experience \u2013 through novels, films, documentaries, and essays. We will examine cases in different national and cultural contexts. We will look in particular at the Italian case; for, Italy represents a unique case in the world: after decades of exporting immigrants, it has become an importer. But we will also examine other histories and experiences (whether in China, Vietnam, Tunisia, France, Romania, the USA, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and others); internal migration (especially to the North of Italy in the fifties and the sixties); and finally non-European Community immigrants.  ITAL-UA 173 Topics in Italian Culture: Medieval Italy Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm, CASA Library Vise Conducted in English Medieval Italy can look like a land replete with impossible contradiction. The northern cities witnessed Europe\u2019s first stirrings of formal republican self-governance since the Fall of Rome but also the violent repression of political dissenters; the flowering of vernacular literature in writers like Petrarca, Dante and Boccaccio but also the highest levels of Latinity in Europe; the development of systems of justice to which modern institutions trace their origin but also notoriously bloody factional violence and vendetta; the boom of a mercantile economy but also wildly popular grassroots religious critiques of wealth. In one city we find the first broad-based emancipation of slaves and serfs in the West while in another, the brutal exclusion of the turbulent lower-class guild of wool carders from political life. They were the \u201ccities of God\u201d where sometimes heretics ruled. The Mezzogiorno, southern Italy, glittered with literary and artistic achievement and bustled with ethnic and religious diversity under the succession of multiple foreign monarchies. And in the middle, the Papal States staggered in competition with the powers of the North, the South, and its own squabbling aristocracy. Yet at the same time, its ruler claimed a monopoly on the souls of European Christians and operated the highest court of appeals for major European legal disputes. In this class, we will explore this complex culture by looking at a wide range of primary sources from poetry to prisoner graffiti, high and low art, and complimentary secondary sources. The course will begin with the early medieval period and the emergence of the communes, Papal states, and Southern Kingdom after the fall of Rome and then proceed thematically to conclude by considering what this period bequeathed to subsequent generations. For each theme, our central question will remain: were these deep contrasts ultimately a source of strength and creativity or of chaos and division? Topics to be covered include: legal and extra-legal justice, religious plurality, politics and religion, women and gender, wealth and poverty, intellectual life, art and patronage, factions and la familia , and the creation of state.  ITAL-UA 174 Italian Films, Italian Histories I (same as DRLIT-UA 503, EURO-UA 173) Tuesday, 12:30pm-3:15pm &amp; Thursday 12:30pm-1:45pm CASA Auditorium Albertini Conducted in English Sample Syll abus  Films are responsible for creating a national identity more than any other medium of communication. Cinematography has played a much more prominent role in the construction of a common popular history in Italy, than in other European states, given the relatively young age of the unified Italian nation. From the papier-mach\u00e9 buildings of ancient Rome presented in the very first Italian movies to the powerful non-professional actors of neorealistic cinema representing the Nazi occupation of the peninsula; these are the images that for generations of Italians represent Italian History, much more than the fading memories of high-school textbooks or of high-brow intellectual debates rigorously kept in the seldom read pages of national newspapers. The purpose of this course (that is ideally completed by \"Italian Films, Italian Histories II\" taught by Professor Ben-Ghiat in the Spring) is to provide a general but accurate overview of Italian history and a critical analysis of its representation through films from the origins to the Risorgimento. This (first) course is devoted to Roman, Medieval, and Renaissance history and it closes with a rather in-depth presentation of different accounts of the Risorgimento (the process of Italian unification). ITAL-UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy (same as COLIT-UA 270, ENGL-UA 142, MEDI-UA 271) Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm, CASA Auditorium Conducted in English   SPRING 2015  ITAL-UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature  Tuesday/Thursday 9:30am-10:45am, CASA 201 Antonangeli Conducted in Italian , (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission) Introductory-level literature course that, through a close reading of   authors such as Alfieri, Foscolo, Leopardi, Manzoni, Verga, D'Annunzio,   Moravia, and Calvino, focuses on how to understand a literary text in   Italian. Covers Italian literature from the 18th century to the   contemporary period. ITAL-UA 121 The Renaissance (same as HIST-UA 121, MEDI-UA 121) Tuesday/Thursday 3:30pm-4:45pm, TISC LC9 Appuhn Conducted in English ITAL-UA 172 Hellscapes and Elysia in the Renaissance and Beyond (same as COLIT-UA 173, ENGL-UA 56, MEDI-UA 172) Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm, CASA 201 McHugh Conducted in English Syllabus  This course explores various representations of otherworlds, both infernal and paradisal: the realms of the afterlife, regions of marvel or idyllic bliss, political utopias and dystopias. Readings and discussion focus on how these imagined lands reflect, critique, and animate the real world, from antiquity through our own times.  ITAL-UA 173.001 Murder, Italian Style! (same as DRLIT-UA 505) Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA 201 Falkoff Course conducted in English; reading knowledge of Italian recommended but not required. A genre whose development is associated with urbanization, crime fiction\u2014like so many other emblems of modernity\u2014is often considered to have arrived belatedly in Italy. Despite this initial reticence, several critically acclaimed writers of contemporary Italy have used the genre as a narrative space from which to launch a broader commentary on aspects of Italian history and culture such as the fascist period, honor killings, police brutality, political corruption, femicide, and xenophobia. This course will consider novels, plays, and films from the 1950s to the present, analyzing the ways in which they use conventions of the crime fiction as a point of departure for literary experimentation, philosophical reflection, and cultural critique. ITAL-UA 173.002 Italy and the Mediterranean: Empire, Politics and Culture (same as AHSEM-UA 218.001 and MEIS-UA 659.001) Tuesday/Thursday 4:55pm-6:10pm, CASA 306 Valerie McGuire Conducted in English NOTE: ONLY OPEN TO CAS SOPHOMORES, JUNIORS, AND SENIORS Shortly after its unification in 1861, the Italian nation began a prolonged attempt to establish an overseas empire on a scale with other European colonial powers. This course examines how Italian imperialism unfolded and how it impacted politics and culture on the global level, as well as how it shaped internal attitudes and beliefs, particularly during Italy\u2019s Fascist period. The course studies the formation of Italy\u2019s national project under two different empires and discovers how processes such as emigration and the Southern Question intertwined with its first attempts to establish foreign colonies. As Ottoman collapse and the First World War initiated a new phase of European colonialism, Italy turned to the Mediterranean as the domain of its empire. We investigate how the Mediterranean region ignited fantasies of the exotic and the familiar and how it both promoted and challenged Italian myths of national identity. The course studies Italy\u2019s imperial history and culture through a range of medium, including film, novels and scholarly articles. Reading knowledge in Italian is a plus but not a requisite. ITAL-UA 282 Italian Cinema and Literature Tuesday 12:30-1:45pm and Thursday 12:30-3:15pm CASA Auditorium Albertini Course conducted in Italian (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission) Sample Syllabus The course will focus on the development of Italian cinema in the post war period, emphasizing the relationship between literature and film adaptation. The books and the films will offer a unique opportunity to analyze and discuss crucial issues related to the historical, political, and cultural evolution of Italy concentrating in particular on the political unification process (Risorgimento). ITAL-UA 285 Topics in Italian Literature: Dante's Purgatorio (same as ENGL-UA 52 and MEDI-UA 285.001) Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA 201 Conducted in English ITAL-UA 724 Italian-American Life in Literature (same as ENGL-UA 724) Tuesday/Thursday 11am-12:15pm, CASA 201 Hendin Conducted in English Sample Syllabus A   study of the fiction and poetry through which Italian American writers   have expressed their heritage and their engagement in American life.   From narratives of immigration to current work by \"assimilated\" writers,   the course explores the depiction of Italian American identity.   Challenging stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships,   sexual mores, and political and social concerns. ITAL-UA 760 Topics in the Renaissance: Visual Languages of the Renaissance: Emblems, Dreams, Hieroglyphs (same as MEDI-UA 760.001) Thursday 12:30pm-3:00pm, CASA 201 Cipani Conducted in English Syllabus Making knowledge visible was one of the great Renaissance endeavors. Some of the period's most characteristic products were born out of the conviction that concepts could be systematically turned into images \u2014 and that such images could be organized into a visual language, more profound and universal than discursive logic. Egyptian hieroglyphs and dream visions, in their mysterious graphic exuberance, were considered typical vehicles of this advanced mode of communication. The desire to emulate their symbolic density is reflected both in literature and in art, often in ways that challenge common distinctions between visual and verbal communication. In this course you will be introduced to an assortment of works representative of such interplay between text and image: emblem books, dream books and dream-centered works, hieroglyphic inventions and studies, collections of proverbs, iconology manuals, etc. Among the books examined are some widely considered as the finest examples of design in the history of printing. Early modern and recent theory of emblems will also be discussed. As a present-day counterpart of Renaissance emblems, the course will conclude with a survey of corporate logos and Russian criminal tattoos. CORE-UA 554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Tuesday/Thursday 12:30-1:45PM FALL 2014  CORE-UA 400-70 Texts and Ideas: Visible and Invisible Cities Tuesday/Thursday 11:00am-12:15pm, CASA Auditorium Cox Sample Syllabus The experience of living in a city is one vital thread that connects us with our ancient, medieval, and early modern ancestors, and that continues to provide a unifying element in millions of our contemporaries\u2019 disparate lives across the globe. Urban life is a constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance, particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and the state.

The emphasis is on improving skills of reading and communication in Italian, while at the same time discussing the history of gender and its politics in a country where the struggle between tradition and change often invests the image and life of women. ITAL-UA 173 Violence and Memory in Contemporary Italy Tuesday/Thursday 2:00-3:15pm Forgacs Conducted in English Sample Syllabus Acts of violence, against individuals or groups of people, have played an important part in the collective memory of Italy after Fascism. However, they have also been open to conflicting interpretations. Was the execution of Mussolini and Clara Petacci and the public desecration of their corpses in Milan in 1945 an act of legitimate retribution for the sufferings inflicted by the Fascist regime and its alliance with Nazi Germany or an act that displaced Italians\u2019 collective guilt over acquiescence? Were the bullets and bombs of the \u201canni di piombo\u201d from 1969 to 1980 assaults on the fabric of a democratic society or symptoms of a malfunctioning political system and civil society? Did the collective mourning of mafia victims in the 1990s allow attention to be turned away from collusion between politicians and organized crime? Why are some massacres well known and publicly commemorated and others largely removed from collective memory? This course takes five cases where violence has given rise to these kinds of controversy and debate over historical memory. ITAL-UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm Freccero Conducted in English Sample Syllabus Students study The Divine Comedy both as a mirror of high medieval culture and as a unique text that breaks out of its cultural bounds.

ITAL-UA 173 Visions on and of Mafia MW 2:00-3:15PM Montalbano From its local origins in Sicily, the Mafia has become a global phenomenon and a widespread model of organized crime that threatens and corrupts the international economy, political systems, and social environments. Though its power and underworld affect legal business, control illegal traffic, and trample human rights, nevertheless film, television, and literature stimulate a continued fascination with a romantic and even heroic vision of the Mafia. In this seminar we will explore and compare American and Italian films on the Mafia and the literary texts upon which many of them are based from the late 1940s to today. Combining the analyses of historians, sociologists, and intellectuals, along with the testimonies of victims, we will not only challenge the stereotypes through which cultural productions envision the Mafiosi but also, and more importantly, we will shift the inquiry to how the Mafiosi envision the world by asking: What is the ideology of Mafia? How do Mafiosi picture society, human beings, and law? Does Mafia have its own ethic? How does a religious imaginary shape a Mafia worldview? How does Mafia\u2019s normative discourse govern the performance of femininity, masculinity, and homosexuality? Can we consider Mafia to be terrorism? Examining together the visions on and of Mafia through cultural, socio-political, and historical perspectives, this seminar aims to deconstruct the mythological eye and instead form an analytical eye with which to investigate and understand the Mafioso universe and power. ITAL-UA 175 Italian Films, Italian Histories II (same as HIST-UA 176, CINE-UT 235, DRLIT-UA 506) M 11:00am-12:15pm; W 11:00am-1:45pm Ben-Ghiat Studies representations  of Italian history from the unification of Italy to the present  through the medium of film.

Challenging stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships, sexual mores, and political and social concerns. ITAL-UA 760-001 Giordano Bruno &amp; the Art of Memory (same as MEDI-UA 760-001) TR 12:30pm-1:45pm Cipani The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the Italian Renaissance. Far more than a mere tool for passive retention of information: memory devices had the ambition to assist in the structuring of thought, the organization of knowledge, the solving of philosophical questions, and were intended also as tools for creative output. This course examines the impact of the pervasive culture of memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the interdependence between textual and visual codes. A main focus will be on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno, burnt at stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe and of nature's creative principles. Sampling the varied textual genres of Bruno's work (philosophical dialogues, writings on magic, a satirical comedy), one of the questions this course aims to answer is the same posed to Bruno by Henry III King of France: is the Art of Memory acquired \"by magic\" or \"by science\"? ITAL-UA 760-002 Humanism in the Renaissance (same as MEDI-UA 760-002) MW 11:00am-12:15pm Freccero  FALL 2013  ITAL UA 115 Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature  MW 9:30-10:45am,  Casa Library  Taught in Italian  (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30; Same as MEDI 115) Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian.

ITAL-UA 142 - The Courtesan in Renaissance Culture &amp; Society Cox TR 11-12:30pm, Casa Library Examines an intriguing figure within the social panorama of Renaissance Italy, the \"honest courtesan\" or cortigiana onesta. It contextualizes courtesans' social position and cultural status, embracing elements of social history, literary history, and music and art history.

ITAL UA 173-001 Topics in Italian Culture: Media, Society and Politics in Italy: Since 1943  Forgacs TR 2-3:15pm, Casa Library The course aims to give students a good understanding of how the mass media and popular cultural forms have interacted with social change and political power in Italy from the fall of Fascism to the present. Some observers have seen postwar Italy as following a relatively normal pattern of evolution of the mass media within a democratic polity, whereas others have seen Italy as exceptional, among the western democracies, both for the degree of political interferences with the media and, since the later 1990s, for the breakdown of democratic norms. This course will enable students to assess these views in an informed way. It will also allow them to consider how far the media should be seen as mirrors of social change and how far were they themselves agents of change. The course will cover some of the most significant moments and turning points in the political and social history of the period, using contemporary sources and documents from various media.   ITAL UA 174 Italian Films, Italian Histories I Albertini T 12:30-3:15pm; R 12:30-1:45pm, Casa Auditorium  Studies representation of Italian history through the medium of film from ancient Rome through the Risorgimento.

The entire poem   is read, in addition to selections from the Vita Nuova and other   complementary minor works.  ITAL UA 271 Boccaccio's Decameron  Ardizzone MW 2:00-3:15pm, Casa Library A study of Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron with particular emphasis on themes, conceptual innovations, and influences on French and English literatures. ITAL-UA 285 Topics in Italian Literature: Food in Italian Literature and Culture - The Art of Taste, The Taste of Nation: Italian Literary and Cinematic Gastronomy Falkoff TR 12:30-1:45pm, Casa Library Casa Library Sample Syllabus \u201cWhat is the glory of Dante compared to spaghetti?\u201d Italian journalist Giuseppe Prezzolini famously asks in his 1954 history of pasta. While numerous cookbooks cite Prezzolini to evoke Italy\u2019s consummate culinary achievements, this course instead poses the question: \u201cWhat is the glory of spaghetti compared to its representation in literature and film?\u201d We begin the semester with short stories by Giovanni Boccaccio in which the preparation and consumption of food becomes a critical act of communication. Turning to films, novels, memoirs, cookbooks, and manifestos from the late nineteenth century to the present, we will reflect upon the narrative functions of elaborate descriptions of culinary triumphs. Do such descriptions constitute a form of \u201cfood-porn\u201d? If so, how is the project of reading and interpreting the texts changed? We will also ask what ideological work is performed by literary gastronomy; and how it contributes to the production of national, regional, and local identities, and socioeconomic differences.   SUMMER 2013  Six-Week Session 1 (May 28-July 5) ITAL-UA 10 Intensive Elementary Italian Instructors: Nicola Lucchi, Wayne Clinger M-F, 9AM-12PM  Six-Week Session 2 (July 8-August 16) ITAL-UA 20 Intensive Intermediate Italian Instructors: Jennifer Newman, Melissa Swain M-F, 9AM-12PM ITAL-UA 173 Italian Crimes, Italian Fictions Instructor: Franco Baldasso Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2PM-5PM The history of Italian culture hides a proliferation of murky stories. Admired literary representations from Dante\u2019s Inferno to Machiavellian politicians, and the cinematic allure of criminal organizations such as mafia or camorra, are only some of the reasons why Italy stands out in the global imagination today also for its crimes, its mysteries and its alluring sinners. Through crime fiction, writers and filmmakers analyze, criticize, and unveil the violence of politics, the complexity of Italian history and its difficult modernization, the collective traumas and the conformism of a society always eager to find a scapegoat for its vices. This course aims to shed new light on modern Italian culture and society through the perspective of the books and films illuminating this dark side. Crime fiction in Italy has a specific name, \u201cil giallo\u201d, from the color of the covers of the popular books that invaded Italian market. \u201cI gialli\u201d are not only a literary genre \u2013 many groundbreaking movies featuring prominent Italian actors and directors, from Mastroianni to Volont\u00e9, share the name. The genre is a major player in Italian self-representation even beyond Hollywood clich\u00e9s. The course will approach modern Italian novels, from Moravia to Sciascia, and their filmic adaptations tackling issues such as the fascist mentality, the evolution of mafia as a modern global enterprise, political terrorism, social and gender exclusion\u2013\u2013looking at what is behind enduring stereotypes about Italians.  SPRING 2013  ITAL UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature Ziegler TR 9:30-10:45AM, Casa Libary Taught in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30) Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from   its origins to 17th century.     ITAL UA 166 Contemporary Italy: Identities, Society, and Culture Albertini TR 2-3:15PM, Casa Library Taught in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30) Covers the political,  cultural, economic, and social history of Italy since World War II.  Starting with the transition from fascism to democracy, examines the  Cold War, the growth of a mass consumer society, the social and  political movements of the late 1960s and 1970s, the battle against  the Mafia, postwar emigration, the rise and fall of postwar Christian  Democracy and Italian communism, and the emergence of new parties in  the 1990s such as Berlusconi's Forza Italia, Bossi's Northern  League, and Fini's neofascist Alleanza Nazionale.    ITAL UA 173-001 Topics in Italian Culture: Verdi's Contexts Izzo TR 11-12:15PM, Casa Auditorium This   course addresses the intersection of art and ideology in Italy,   Germany, Spain, France, and the Soviet Union, during the period   1914-1968. In each instance, we will examine the tensions between   cultures of fascism and anti- fascism ,   both visual and verbal. Addressing the development of fascist ideology   and its relationship to culture, our focus will shift from Futurist   proto-fascist incitements to nationalist war and colonialism, to Dadaist   subversion of that same rhetoric, to the shifting and evolving tensions   of these forces throughout the period between the World Wars. Along the   way, we will examine the representational strategies of different   political systems (and their dissenters) in context: Nazi Germany,   Mussolini\u2019s Italy, Popular Front and Vichy France, Republican and   Franco\u2019s Spain, and (as a counterpoint) the post-revolutionary Soviet   Union. Addressing both the interventions of particular artists, as well   as broader issues of media and modernism, we will consider how the   struggle between fascism and anti- fascism    lies at the heart of twentieth-century culture. We will look at a   variety of media, objects, and texts: from film and photography, to   painting and exhibitions, to posters and spectacles, to poems and   manifestos. In each instance will consider some specific case studies,   whether the 1932 Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution or the 1937   Degenerate Art Exhibition in Nazi Germany.  ITAL UA 283 Other Worlds: Travel Literature in Italy Ferrari MW 2-3:15pm, Casa Library Ubiquitous   concepts - \"home,\" \"discovery,\" \"difference,\" - appear to be simple;   yet they mask complex literary and social themes. This course will   analyze how a voyage changes not only our conception of a given   destination, but also of our point of departure: of all the familiar   surroundings, signposts, and people that we recognize as \"home.\" Home is   then defined not simply as one's family and household but as all the   components that shape one's identity and sense of belonging, such as   nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, and gender. Every journey is   marked by displacement: a transformation that calls into question the   traveler's original position so that, to borrow Thomas Wolfe's phrase,   one can never \"go home again.\" This course will examine a selection of   Italian travel narratives within the context of contemporary   post-colonial theory. Questions to be addressed include: the relation   between power and the production of knowledge as it manifests itself in   such narratives; intertextuality and its ideological effects; modes of   representation of racial, cultural, historical, and sexual otherness.  ITAL UA 285-001 Tpcs in Italian Literature: Remapping Italian Cultural History: Private and Public Intellectuals in Italy from St. Francis to Boccaccio Ardizzone MW 12:30-1:45PM, Casa Library This course enlarges the range of texts offered in an undergraduate course on early modern Italian culture, including works less well known and not considered part of the canon. We begin by focusing on the notion of an intellectual as defined by both contemporary and non-contemporary historians or philosophers like J. Le Goff, A. De Libera, E. Said, A. Gramsci, and R. W. Emerson. The works of these authors will allow us to expand the notion of the intellectual and to introduce as intellectual every commitment resulting in a work useful to the public in the broadest sense. Dante\u2019s statement that being intellectual means knowing our proper goal or the aim of our actions introduces the idea that every human work is intellectually motivated either by being directed to the public or by being conceived in a private way. We therefore introduce the idea that both public and private intellectuals, directly or indirectly, collaborate in creating a work of collective use and identity. That a public intellectual must first be a private intellectual is our starting point. Under the category of intellectual we therefore list the sailors committed to making portolan charts and the mapmakers who devised instruments for practical knowledge.In the same way, we include the merchants who invented the single-double entry in bookkeeping. The figure of a saint like St. Francis of Assisi is part of the picture because he has advanced human freedom and awareness. The pilgrims who link devotion and travel enter the list, along with poets, writers, statesmen and masters of rhetoric, philosophers, craftsmen, and artists. Theory and pragmatism are considered in the course as deeply connected. Literary, philosophical culture is linked to technical scientific knowledge. Readings include works by St. Francis and St. Claire of Assisi, Marco Polo, Pier delle Vigne, Brunetto Latini, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, along with texts written by merchants and pilgrims. Works of artists from Romanesque to Gothic will be considered, as well as those of cartographers or makers of portolans. The course concludes by touching briefly on the culture of the Quattrocento and the new emerging model of the intellectual that is proposed, for example, in the Florentine culture of that time. The course will be given in English.

From   narratives of immigration to current work by \"assimilated\" writers, the   course explores the depiction of Italian American identity. Challenging   stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships, sexual mores,   and political and social concerns.  ITAL UA 760 Tpcs in Renaissance: Giordano Bruno and the Art of Memory  Cipani TR 12:30-1:45PM, Casa Library The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the   Italian Renaissance.

Urban life is a   constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New   York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual   frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the   ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the   Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance,   particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat   of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and   the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of   political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world   communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and   urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle,   Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de   Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now   becoming visible.  ITAL-UA 115 Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature Tuesday/Thursday 9:30am-10:45am, CASA Library Instructor TBD Conducted in Italian , (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission)  Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from   its origins to 17th century.     ITAL-UA 148 Giordano Bruno and the Art of Memory (same as HIST-UA 126) Tuesday 12:30pm-3:15pm, CASA Library Cipani Conducted in English The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the Italian Renaissance. Far more than a mere tool for passive retention of information: memory devices had the ambition to assist in the structuring of thought, the organization of knowledge, the solving of philosophical questions, and were intended also as tools for creative output. This course examines the impact of the pervasive culture of memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the interdependence between textual and visual codes. A main focus will be on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno, burnt at stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe and of nature's creative principles. We will first examine Bruno's works explicitly devoted to memory, assessing elements of continuity and innovation with respect to the tradition. Subsequently, sampling Bruno's Italian dialogues, his writings on magic, and his satyrical comedy Candlebearer, we will look for intersections between his theory of memory, on the one hand, and his strategy of self-representation, his literary style, and his doctrine of infinity on the other. ITAL-UA 164 Italian Colonialism (same as HIST-UA 204, EURO-UA 161) Monday 9:30am-12:15pm, CASA Library Ben-Ghiat Conducted in English ITAL-UA 172 Topics: Narrating Immigrant Experience Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA Library Lakhous Conducted in English How can we narrate immigration today? Can we argue that the immigrant experience is universal? How can we recount family memories of immigration? What is the relationship between identity and memory? What are the connections between immigration, emigration, and colonialism? We will attempt to answer such questions \u2013 and to approach different narratives of immigrant experience \u2013 through novels, films, documentaries, and essays. We will examine cases in different national and cultural contexts. We will look in particular at the Italian case; for, Italy represents a unique case in the world: after decades of exporting immigrants, it has become an importer. But we will also examine other histories and experiences (whether in China, Vietnam, Tunisia, France, Romania, the USA, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and others); internal migration (especially to the North of Italy in the fifties and the sixties); and finally non-European Community immigrants.  ITAL-UA 173 Topics in Italian Culture: Medieval Italy Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm, CASA Library Vise Conducted in English Medieval Italy can look like a land replete with impossible contradiction. The northern cities witnessed Europe\u2019s first stirrings of formal republican self-governance since the Fall of Rome but also the violent repression of political dissenters; the flowering of vernacular literature in writers like Petrarca, Dante and Boccaccio but also the highest levels of Latinity in Europe; the development of systems of justice to which modern institutions trace their origin but also notoriously bloody factional violence and vendetta; the boom of a mercantile economy but also wildly popular grassroots religious critiques of wealth. In one city we find the first broad-based emancipation of slaves and serfs in the West while in another, the brutal exclusion of the turbulent lower-class guild of wool carders from political life. They were the \u201ccities of God\u201d where sometimes heretics ruled. The Mezzogiorno, southern Italy, glittered with literary and artistic achievement and bustled with ethnic and religious diversity under the succession of multiple foreign monarchies. And in the middle, the Papal States staggered in competition with the powers of the North, the South, and its own squabbling aristocracy. Yet at the same time, its ruler claimed a monopoly on the souls of European Christians and operated the highest court of appeals for major European legal disputes. In this class, we will explore this complex culture by looking at a wide range of primary sources from poetry to prisoner graffiti, high and low art, and complimentary secondary sources. The course will begin with the early medieval period and the emergence of the communes, Papal states, and Southern Kingdom after the fall of Rome and then proceed thematically to conclude by considering what this period bequeathed to subsequent generations. For each theme, our central question will remain: were these deep contrasts ultimately a source of strength and creativity or of chaos and division? Topics to be covered include: legal and extra-legal justice, religious plurality, politics and religion, women and gender, wealth and poverty, intellectual life, art and patronage, factions and la familia , and the creation of state.  ITAL-UA 174 Italian Films, Italian Histories I (same as DRLIT-UA 503, EURO-UA 173) Tuesday, 12:30pm-3:15pm &amp; Thursday 12:30pm-1:45pm CASA Auditorium Albertini Conducted in English Sample Syll abus  Films are responsible for creating a national identity more than any other medium of communication. Cinematography has played a much more prominent role in the construction of a common popular history in Italy, than in other European states, given the relatively young age of the unified Italian nation. From the papier-mach\u00e9 buildings of ancient Rome presented in the very first Italian movies to the powerful non-professional actors of neorealistic cinema representing the Nazi occupation of the peninsula; these are the images that for generations of Italians represent Italian History, much more than the fading memories of high-school textbooks or of high-brow intellectual debates rigorously kept in the seldom read pages of national newspapers. The purpose of this course (that is ideally completed by \"Italian Films, Italian Histories II\" taught by Professor Ben-Ghiat in the Spring) is to provide a general but accurate overview of Italian history and a critical analysis of its representation through films from the origins to the Risorgimento. This (first) course is devoted to Roman, Medieval, and Renaissance history and it closes with a rather in-depth presentation of different accounts of the Risorgimento (the process of Italian unification). ITAL-UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy (same as COLIT-UA 270, ENGL-UA 142, MEDI-UA 271) Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm, CASA Auditorium Conducted in English   SPRING 2015  ITAL-UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature  Tuesday/Thursday 9:30am-10:45am, CASA 201 Antonangeli Conducted in Italian , (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission) Introductory-level literature course that, through a close reading of   authors such as Alfieri, Foscolo, Leopardi, Manzoni, Verga, D'Annunzio,   Moravia, and Calvino, focuses on how to understand a literary text in   Italian. Covers Italian literature from the 18th century to the   contemporary period. ITAL-UA 121 The Renaissance (same as HIST-UA 121, MEDI-UA 121) Tuesday/Thursday 3:30pm-4:45pm, TISC LC9 Appuhn Conducted in English ITAL-UA 172 Hellscapes and Elysia in the Renaissance and Beyond (same as COLIT-UA 173, ENGL-UA 56, MEDI-UA 172) Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm, CASA 201 McHugh Conducted in English Syllabus  This course explores various representations of otherworlds, both infernal and paradisal: the realms of the afterlife, regions of marvel or idyllic bliss, political utopias and dystopias. Readings and discussion focus on how these imagined lands reflect, critique, and animate the real world, from antiquity through our own times.  ITAL-UA 173.001 Murder, Italian Style! (same as DRLIT-UA 505) Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA 201 Falkoff Course conducted in English; reading knowledge of Italian recommended but not required. A genre whose development is associated with urbanization, crime fiction\u2014like so many other emblems of modernity\u2014is often considered to have arrived belatedly in Italy. Despite this initial reticence, several critically acclaimed writers of contemporary Italy have used the genre as a narrative space from which to launch a broader commentary on aspects of Italian history and culture such as the fascist period, honor killings, police brutality, political corruption, femicide, and xenophobia. This course will consider novels, plays, and films from the 1950s to the present, analyzing the ways in which they use conventions of the crime fiction as a point of departure for literary experimentation, philosophical reflection, and cultural critique. ITAL-UA 173.002 Italy and the Mediterranean: Empire, Politics and Culture (same as AHSEM-UA 218.001 and MEIS-UA 659.001) Tuesday/Thursday 4:55pm-6:10pm, CASA 306 Valerie McGuire Conducted in English NOTE: ONLY OPEN TO CAS SOPHOMORES, JUNIORS, AND SENIORS Shortly after its unification in 1861, the Italian nation began a prolonged attempt to establish an overseas empire on a scale with other European colonial powers. This course examines how Italian imperialism unfolded and how it impacted politics and culture on the global level, as well as how it shaped internal attitudes and beliefs, particularly during Italy\u2019s Fascist period. The course studies the formation of Italy\u2019s national project under two different empires and discovers how processes such as emigration and the Southern Question intertwined with its first attempts to establish foreign colonies. As Ottoman collapse and the First World War initiated a new phase of European colonialism, Italy turned to the Mediterranean as the domain of its empire. We investigate how the Mediterranean region ignited fantasies of the exotic and the familiar and how it both promoted and challenged Italian myths of national identity. The course studies Italy\u2019s imperial history and culture through a range of medium, including film, novels and scholarly articles. Reading knowledge in Italian is a plus but not a requisite. ITAL-UA 282 Italian Cinema and Literature Tuesday 12:30-1:45pm and Thursday 12:30-3:15pm CASA Auditorium Albertini Course conducted in Italian (Prerequisite of ITAL-UA 30 or by Department's permission) Sample Syllabus The course will focus on the development of Italian cinema in the post war period, emphasizing the relationship between literature and film adaptation. The books and the films will offer a unique opportunity to analyze and discuss crucial issues related to the historical, political, and cultural evolution of Italy concentrating in particular on the political unification process (Risorgimento). ITAL-UA 285 Topics in Italian Literature: Dante's Purgatorio (same as ENGL-UA 52 and MEDI-UA 285.001) Monday/Wednesday 12:30pm-1:45pm, CASA 201 Conducted in English ITAL-UA 724 Italian-American Life in Literature (same as ENGL-UA 724) Tuesday/Thursday 11am-12:15pm, CASA 201 Hendin Conducted in English Sample Syllabus A   study of the fiction and poetry through which Italian American writers   have expressed their heritage and their engagement in American life.   From narratives of immigration to current work by \"assimilated\" writers,   the course explores the depiction of Italian American identity.   Challenging stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships,   sexual mores, and political and social concerns. ITAL-UA 760 Topics in the Renaissance: Visual Languages of the Renaissance: Emblems, Dreams, Hieroglyphs (same as MEDI-UA 760.001) Thursday 12:30pm-3:00pm, CASA 201 Cipani Conducted in English Syllabus Making knowledge visible was one of the great Renaissance endeavors. Some of the period's most characteristic products were born out of the conviction that concepts could be systematically turned into images \u2014 and that such images could be organized into a visual language, more profound and universal than discursive logic. Egyptian hieroglyphs and dream visions, in their mysterious graphic exuberance, were considered typical vehicles of this advanced mode of communication. The desire to emulate their symbolic density is reflected both in literature and in art, often in ways that challenge common distinctions between visual and verbal communication. In this course you will be introduced to an assortment of works representative of such interplay between text and image: emblem books, dream books and dream-centered works, hieroglyphic inventions and studies, collections of proverbs, iconology manuals, etc. Among the books examined are some widely considered as the finest examples of design in the history of printing. Early modern and recent theory of emblems will also be discussed. As a present-day counterpart of Renaissance emblems, the course will conclude with a survey of corporate logos and Russian criminal tattoos. CORE-UA 554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Tuesday/Thursday 12:30-1:45PM FALL 2014  CORE-UA 400-70 Texts and Ideas: Visible and Invisible Cities Tuesday/Thursday 11:00am-12:15pm, CASA Auditorium Cox Sample Syllabus The experience of living in a city is one vital thread that connects us with our ancient, medieval, and early modern ancestors, and that continues to provide a unifying element in millions of our contemporaries\u2019 disparate lives across the globe. Urban life is a constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance, particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle, Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now becoming visible. ITAL-UA 115 Readings in Medieval &amp; Renaissance Literature CANCELED ITAL-UA 165 Italian Fascism (same as HIST-UA 171) Monday 11am-1:45pm Ben-Ghiat Conducted in English Syllabus This interdisciplinary course examines the dictatorship that ruled Italy between 1922 and 1943. We address the relationship between culture and politics, public and private; Fascist biopolitics; anti-Fascism; fascist colonialism and racism; the cult of Mussolini; and Fascist-era feminities and masculinities. We will combine secondary sources with readings of Fascist speeches and anti-Fascist novels, and viewings of newsreels and Fascist war films. The course is conducted in English, and most of the readings are in English. ITAL-UA 166 Contemporary Italy (same as EURO-UA 164) Tuesday/Thursday 12:30pm-1:45pm Albertini Conducted in English Covers the political, cultural, economic, and social history of Italy since World War II. Starting with the transition from fascism to democracy, examines the Cold War, the growth of a mass consumer society, the social and political movements of the late 1960s and 1970s, the battle against the Mafia, postwar emigration, the rise and fall of postwar Christian Democracy and Italian communism, and the emergence of new parties in the 1990s such as Berlusconi's Forza Italia, Bossi's Northern League, and Fini's neofascist Alleanza Nazionale. ITAL-UA 172 Portraits of Women: From 19th to 20th Century Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm Ducci Conducted in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30 Advanced Review of Modern Italian) The purpose of this class is to understand the changing image and voice of Italian women in a period of intense change from traditionalism to modernity. The course is based on a choice of short texts in Italian, selected for their relevance and accessible language, combined with images and visual material taken from painting, photography, fashion, theater, and film. The emphasis is on improving skills of reading and communication in Italian, while at the same time discussing the history of gender and its politics in a country where the struggle between tradition and change often invests the image and life of women. ITAL-UA 173 Violence and Memory in Contemporary Italy Tuesday/Thursday 2:00-3:15pm Forgacs Conducted in English Sample Syllabus Acts of violence, against individuals or groups of people, have played an important part in the collective memory of Italy after Fascism. However, they have also been open to conflicting interpretations. Was the execution of Mussolini and Clara Petacci and the public desecration of their corpses in Milan in 1945 an act of legitimate retribution for the sufferings inflicted by the Fascist regime and its alliance with Nazi Germany or an act that displaced Italians\u2019 collective guilt over acquiescence? Were the bullets and bombs of the \u201canni di piombo\u201d from 1969 to 1980 assaults on the fabric of a democratic society or symptoms of a malfunctioning political system and civil society? Did the collective mourning of mafia victims in the 1990s allow attention to be turned away from collusion between politicians and organized crime? Why are some massacres well known and publicly commemorated and others largely removed from collective memory? This course takes five cases where violence has given rise to these kinds of controversy and debate over historical memory. ITAL-UA 270 Dante's Divine Comedy Monday/Wednesday 11am-12:15pm Freccero Conducted in English Sample Syllabus Students study The Divine Comedy both as a mirror of high medieval culture and as a unique text that breaks out of its cultural bounds. The entire poem is read, in addition to selections from the Vita Nuova and other complementary minor works. ITAL-UA 285-001 Love in the Renaissance: From Lyric to Letters Wednesday 11am-1:45pm Bolzoni Conducted in English, Readings in Italian . Love is one of the central themes of the Renaissance literature. The course is aimed to investigate how such topic is represented and discussed in different literary genres: poetry, theatre, letters, chivalric poems. Special attention will be paid to the representation of passions and the figure of woman. During the course, a number of texts will be read: compositions of women poets, such as Gaspara Stampa and Isabella di Morra, will be analysed; among the theatre pieces, La Mandragola by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli; as far as letters are concerned, students will investigate the epistolary exchange between Pietro Bembo and Maria Savorgnan; finally, regarding the chivalric poems, episodes from Orlando innamorato of Matteo M. Boiardo and Orlando furioso of Ludovico Ariosto will be analysed. Moreover, the reading of a number of love poems by Michelangelo will represent an occasion for investigating the intertwining links between literature and figurative arts. ITAL-UA 285-002 Ecologies of Italian Literature Monday/Wednesday 2pm-3:15pm CANCELED ITAL-UA 861 Past and Present Stories of Italian Immigration Monday/Wednesday 2:00pm-3:15pm Marazzi Syllabus Conducted in English This course provides a cultural approach to the history of the adaptation of Italian immigrants to American culture and society, and compares it with the present change occurring in Italy, in the light of an unprecedented inbound immigration. The epical phenomenon of the Italian mass migration to the U.S. will be examined using immigrants\u2019 words as primary sources \u2013 analyzing novels, poetry, \u201ccolonial\u201d journalism and theatre, and private letters \u2013 with a keen attention to cases of bilingualism and code-mixing.                            SPRING 2014  \u2028ITAL-UA 30 Advanced Review of Modern Italian Section 001 - TWR 11:00am-12:15pm Section 002 - TWR 2:00pm-3:15pm Anderson-Tirro Taught in Italian Prerequisite: Intermediate Italian II (ITAL-UA 12), or Intensive Intermediate Italian (ITAL-UA 20), or placement exam.

The course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension, as well as written expression. A special emphasis is on the analysis of dialogue, style, and linguistic choices of each author, in order to explore the development of the written language, slang, regional expressions, and linguistic differences that have accompanied and defined the evolution of Italian over the past 20 years. ITAL-UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature (same as COLIT-UA 141) MW 9:30-10:45am Lucchi Taught in Italian Sample Syllabus Introductory-level literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as Alfieri, Foscolo, Leopardi, Manzoni, Verga, D'Annunzio, Moravia, and Calvino, focuses on how to understand a literary text in Italian. Covers Italian literature from the 18th century to the contemporary period. ITAL-UA 147 Machiavelli (same as MEDI-147) TR 2:00pm-3:15pm Albertini The inventor of modern political science, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli is one of the most original thinkers in the history of Western civilization. In this course, Machiavelli's political, historical, and theatrical works are read in the context in which they were conceived\u2014the much tormented and exciting Florence of the 15th and early 16th centuries, struggling between republican rule and the magnificent tyranny of the Medici family. ITAL-UA 160 Dante and His World (same as COLIT-UA 173, ENGL-UA 143 and MEDI-UA 801) MW 12:30pm-1:45pm Ardizzone                           Interdisciplinary introduction to late medieval culture, using Dante, its foremost literary artist, as a focus. Attention is directed to literature, art, and music, in addition to political, religious, and social developments of the time.

Readings include selections from Dante\u2019s works as The New Life, The Divine Comedy, The Monarchy along with texts by St. Augustine, Severinus Boethius, St. Francis , Brunetto Latini, Thomas Aquinas, Boccaccio. Works of vernacular poets of 13th century and artists from Romanesque to Gothic will be considered. The course will be given in English. ITAL-UA 173 Visions on and of Mafia MW 2:00-3:15PM Montalbano From its local origins in Sicily, the Mafia has become a global phenomenon and a widespread model of organized crime that threatens and corrupts the international economy, political systems, and social environments. Though its power and underworld affect legal business, control illegal traffic, and trample human rights, nevertheless film, television, and literature stimulate a continued fascination with a romantic and even heroic vision of the Mafia. In this seminar we will explore and compare American and Italian films on the Mafia and the literary texts upon which many of them are based from the late 1940s to today. Combining the analyses of historians, sociologists, and intellectuals, along with the testimonies of victims, we will not only challenge the stereotypes through which cultural productions envision the Mafiosi but also, and more importantly, we will shift the inquiry to how the Mafiosi envision the world by asking: What is the ideology of Mafia? How do Mafiosi picture society, human beings, and law? Does Mafia have its own ethic? How does a religious imaginary shape a Mafia worldview? How does Mafia\u2019s normative discourse govern the performance of femininity, masculinity, and homosexuality? Can we consider Mafia to be terrorism? Examining together the visions on and of Mafia through cultural, socio-political, and historical perspectives, this seminar aims to deconstruct the mythological eye and instead form an analytical eye with which to investigate and understand the Mafioso universe and power. ITAL-UA 175 Italian Films, Italian Histories II (same as HIST-UA 176, CINE-UT 235, DRLIT-UA 506) M 11:00am-12:15pm; W 11:00am-1:45pm Ben-Ghiat Studies representations  of Italian history from the unification of Italy to the present  through the medium of film.

Challenging stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships, sexual mores, and political and social concerns. ITAL-UA 760-001 Giordano Bruno &amp; the Art of Memory (same as MEDI-UA 760-001) TR 12:30pm-1:45pm Cipani The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the Italian Renaissance. Far more than a mere tool for passive retention of information: memory devices had the ambition to assist in the structuring of thought, the organization of knowledge, the solving of philosophical questions, and were intended also as tools for creative output. This course examines the impact of the pervasive culture of memory on the literary production of the time, highlighting the interdependence between textual and visual codes. A main focus will be on the heretic philosopher and cosmologist Giordano Bruno, burnt at stake by the Roman Inquisition in 1600, who conceived his imposing mnemonic system as an inner mirror of the infinite universe and of nature's creative principles. Sampling the varied textual genres of Bruno's work (philosophical dialogues, writings on magic, a satirical comedy), one of the questions this course aims to answer is the same posed to Bruno by Henry III King of France: is the Art of Memory acquired \"by magic\" or \"by science\"? ITAL-UA 760-002 Humanism in the Renaissance (same as MEDI-UA 760-002) MW 11:00am-12:15pm Freccero  FALL 2013  ITAL UA 115 Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature  MW 9:30-10:45am,  Casa Library  Taught in Italian  (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30; Same as MEDI 115) Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian.

ITAL-UA 142 - The Courtesan in Renaissance Culture &amp; Society Cox TR 11-12:30pm, Casa Library Examines an intriguing figure within the social panorama of Renaissance Italy, the \"honest courtesan\" or cortigiana onesta. It contextualizes courtesans' social position and cultural status, embracing elements of social history, literary history, and music and art history. Texts studied include both representations of courtesans, such as the notorious dialogues of Pietro Aretino, and writings by courtesan poets, such as Tullia d'Aragona and Veronica Franco.  ITAL UA 173-001 Topics in Italian Culture: Media, Society and Politics in Italy: Since 1943  Forgacs TR 2-3:15pm, Casa Library The course aims to give students a good understanding of how the mass media and popular cultural forms have interacted with social change and political power in Italy from the fall of Fascism to the present. Some observers have seen postwar Italy as following a relatively normal pattern of evolution of the mass media within a democratic polity, whereas others have seen Italy as exceptional, among the western democracies, both for the degree of political interferences with the media and, since the later 1990s, for the breakdown of democratic norms. This course will enable students to assess these views in an informed way. It will also allow them to consider how far the media should be seen as mirrors of social change and how far were they themselves agents of change. The course will cover some of the most significant moments and turning points in the political and social history of the period, using contemporary sources and documents from various media.   ITAL UA 174 Italian Films, Italian Histories I Albertini T 12:30-3:15pm; R 12:30-1:45pm, Casa Auditorium  Studies representation of Italian history through the medium of film from ancient Rome through the Risorgimento.

ITAL-UA 285 Topics in Italian Literature: Food in Italian Literature and Culture - The Art of Taste, The Taste of Nation: Italian Literary and Cinematic Gastronomy Falkoff TR 12:30-1:45pm, Casa Library Casa Library Sample Syllabus \u201cWhat is the glory of Dante compared to spaghetti?\u201d Italian journalist Giuseppe Prezzolini famously asks in his 1954 history of pasta. While numerous cookbooks cite Prezzolini to evoke Italy\u2019s consummate culinary achievements, this course instead poses the question: \u201cWhat is the glory of spaghetti compared to its representation in literature and film?\u201d We begin the semester with short stories by Giovanni Boccaccio in which the preparation and consumption of food becomes a critical act of communication. Turning to films, novels, memoirs, cookbooks, and manifestos from the late nineteenth century to the present, we will reflect upon the narrative functions of elaborate descriptions of culinary triumphs. Do such descriptions constitute a form of \u201cfood-porn\u201d? If so, how is the project of reading and interpreting the texts changed? We will also ask what ideological work is performed by literary gastronomy; and how it contributes to the production of national, regional, and local identities, and socioeconomic differences.   SUMMER 2013  Six-Week Session 1 (May 28-July 5) ITAL-UA 10 Intensive Elementary Italian Instructors: Nicola Lucchi, Wayne Clinger M-F, 9AM-12PM  Six-Week Session 2 (July 8-August 16) ITAL-UA 20 Intensive Intermediate Italian Instructors: Jennifer Newman, Melissa Swain M-F, 9AM-12PM ITAL-UA 173 Italian Crimes, Italian Fictions Instructor: Franco Baldasso Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2PM-5PM The history of Italian culture hides a proliferation of murky stories. Admired literary representations from Dante\u2019s Inferno to Machiavellian politicians, and the cinematic allure of criminal organizations such as mafia or camorra, are only some of the reasons why Italy stands out in the global imagination today also for its crimes, its mysteries and its alluring sinners. Through crime fiction, writers and filmmakers analyze, criticize, and unveil the violence of politics, the complexity of Italian history and its difficult modernization, the collective traumas and the conformism of a society always eager to find a scapegoat for its vices. This course aims to shed new light on modern Italian culture and society through the perspective of the books and films illuminating this dark side. Crime fiction in Italy has a specific name, \u201cil giallo\u201d, from the color of the covers of the popular books that invaded Italian market. \u201cI gialli\u201d are not only a literary genre \u2013 many groundbreaking movies featuring prominent Italian actors and directors, from Mastroianni to Volont\u00e9, share the name. The genre is a major player in Italian self-representation even beyond Hollywood clich\u00e9s. The course will approach modern Italian novels, from Moravia to Sciascia, and their filmic adaptations tackling issues such as the fascist mentality, the evolution of mafia as a modern global enterprise, political terrorism, social and gender exclusion\u2013\u2013looking at what is behind enduring stereotypes about Italians.  SPRING 2013  ITAL UA 116 Readings in Modern Italian Literature Ziegler TR 9:30-10:45AM, Casa Libary Taught in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30) Introductory-level   literature course that, through a close reading of authors such as   Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch,Machiavelli, and Ariosto, focuses on how to   understand a literary text in Italian.

ITAL UA 166 Contemporary Italy: Identities, Society, and Culture Albertini TR 2-3:15PM, Casa Library Taught in Italian (Prereq: ITAL-UA 30) Covers the political,  cultural, economic, and social history of Italy since World War II.  Starting with the transition from fascism to democracy, examines the  Cold War, the growth of a mass consumer society, the social and  political movements of the late 1960s and 1970s, the battle against  the Mafia, postwar emigration, the rise and fall of postwar Christian  Democracy and Italian communism, and the emergence of new parties in  the 1990s such as Berlusconi's Forza Italia, Bossi's Northern  League, and Fini's neofascist Alleanza Nazionale.    ITAL UA 173-001 Topics in Italian Culture: Verdi's Contexts Izzo TR 11-12:15PM, Casa Auditorium This   course addresses the intersection of art and ideology in Italy,   Germany, Spain, France, and the Soviet Union, during the period   1914-1968. In each instance, we will examine the tensions between   cultures of fascism and anti- fascism ,   both visual and verbal. Addressing the development of fascist ideology   and its relationship to culture, our focus will shift from Futurist   proto-fascist incitements to nationalist war and colonialism, to Dadaist   subversion of that same rhetoric, to the shifting and evolving tensions   of these forces throughout the period between the World Wars. Along the   way, we will examine the representational strategies of different   political systems (and their dissenters) in context: Nazi Germany,   Mussolini\u2019s Italy, Popular Front and Vichy France, Republican and   Franco\u2019s Spain, and (as a counterpoint) the post-revolutionary Soviet   Union. Addressing both the interventions of particular artists, as well   as broader issues of media and modernism, we will consider how the   struggle between fascism and anti- fascism    lies at the heart of twentieth-century culture. We will look at a   variety of media, objects, and texts: from film and photography, to   painting and exhibitions, to posters and spectacles, to poems and   manifestos. In each instance will consider some specific case studies,   whether the 1932 Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution or the 1937   Degenerate Art Exhibition in Nazi Germany.  ITAL UA 283 Other Worlds: Travel Literature in Italy Ferrari MW 2-3:15pm, Casa Library Ubiquitous   concepts - \"home,\" \"discovery,\" \"difference,\" - appear to be simple;   yet they mask complex literary and social themes. This course will   analyze how a voyage changes not only our conception of a given   destination, but also of our point of departure: of all the familiar   surroundings, signposts, and people that we recognize as \"home.\" Home is   then defined not simply as one's family and household but as all the   components that shape one's identity and sense of belonging, such as   nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, and gender. Every journey is   marked by displacement: a transformation that calls into question the   traveler's original position so that, to borrow Thomas Wolfe's phrase,   one can never \"go home again.\" This course will examine a selection of   Italian travel narratives within the context of contemporary   post-colonial theory. Questions to be addressed include: the relation   between power and the production of knowledge as it manifests itself in   such narratives; intertextuality and its ideological effects; modes of   representation of racial, cultural, historical, and sexual otherness.  ITAL UA 285-001 Tpcs in Italian Literature: Remapping Italian Cultural History: Private and Public Intellectuals in Italy from St. Francis to Boccaccio Ardizzone MW 12:30-1:45PM, Casa Library This course enlarges the range of texts offered in an undergraduate course on early modern Italian culture, including works less well known and not considered part of the canon. We begin by focusing on the notion of an intellectual as defined by both contemporary and non-contemporary historians or philosophers like J. Le Goff, A. De Libera, E. Said, A. Gramsci, and R. W. Emerson. The works of these authors will allow us to expand the notion of the intellectual and to introduce as intellectual every commitment resulting in a work useful to the public in the broadest sense. Dante\u2019s statement that being intellectual means knowing our proper goal or the aim of our actions introduces the idea that every human work is intellectually motivated either by being directed to the public or by being conceived in a private way. We therefore introduce the idea that both public and private intellectuals, directly or indirectly, collaborate in creating a work of collective use and identity. That a public intellectual must first be a private intellectual is our starting point. Under the category of intellectual we therefore list the sailors committed to making portolan charts and the mapmakers who devised instruments for practical knowledge.In the same way, we include the merchants who invented the single-double entry in bookkeeping. The figure of a saint like St. Francis of Assisi is part of the picture because he has advanced human freedom and awareness. The pilgrims who link devotion and travel enter the list, along with poets, writers, statesmen and masters of rhetoric, philosophers, craftsmen, and artists. Theory and pragmatism are considered in the course as deeply connected. Literary, philosophical culture is linked to technical scientific knowledge. Readings include works by St. Francis and St. Claire of Assisi, Marco Polo, Pier delle Vigne, Brunetto Latini, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, along with texts written by merchants and pilgrims. Works of artists from Romanesque to Gothic will be considered, as well as those of cartographers or makers of portolans. The course concludes by touching briefly on the culture of the Quattrocento and the new emerging model of the intellectual that is proposed, for example, in the Florentine culture of that time. The course will be given in English.

Challenging   stereotypes, it explores changing family relationships, sexual mores,   and political and social concerns.  ITAL UA 760 Tpcs in Renaissance: Giordano Bruno and the Art of Memory  Cipani TR 12:30-1:45PM, Casa Library The Art of Memory reached a peak of refinement and complexity during the   Italian Renaissance.

PUBLIC HISTORY    The program in public history provides Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy candidates with the opportunity to prepare for careers as historians in public and private institutions outside academia, where historical perspectives address areas as diverse as public policy, museum programs, and historical dramatizations for media. The program offers students three areas of historical work: media history, local and community history, and history and public policy.    All entering students enroll in a sequential two-semester seminar in public history that introduces students to literature and problems in the various public history arenas. Students complete a major research essay and then translate that research into a public history format for a public audience.    The concentration in public history is open to all qualified M.A. and Ph.D. students. It consists of the introductory sequence; a course in one of the three tracks; a methodological course in either oral history or quantitative methods ( G57.2012 or G57.2019), and four electives in the department, of which one should be a research seminar. Public history can satisfy the departmental requirement for a secondary field. For Americanists, the courses must be comparative or in another field or in some combination thereof.    M.A. students may elect instead to complete a 44-point program leading to a New York State Board of Regents Certificate in Public History. In addition to requiring all the courses in the concentration, the certificate program requires students to take the two remaining introductory track courses and Literature of the Field: America to 1865 ( G57.1600). Finally, all public history students should complement class work with internships in various participating agencies in theNew York metropolitan area.    Enrollment is limited, and admission must be approved by the director of the program. Inquiries should be addressed to Professor Paul Mattingly, Director, Program in Public History, Department of History, Faculty of Arts and Science, New York University, 19 University Place, New York, NY 10003-4556.

ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT AND HISTORICAL EDITING    The program in archival management and historical editing offers students the opportunity to combine either a Master of Arts or a Ph.D. degree in history with an Advanced Certificate in Archival Management and Historical Editing. The certificate program is also open to students with an M.A. or a Ph.D. degree in another appropriate social science- or humanities-based discipline. Ph.D. candidates in history may also elect to use the archives program as a second field, and Ph.D. students wishing to complete the entire program may apply 12 of the 20 required points toward their Ph.D. requirements.    Since 1977, this program has trained graduate history students for careers as archivists, historical editors, administrators, and manuscript curators. The program provides students with a solid foundation in the theory, methodology, and practice of archives. It also emphasizes the broad humanistic training in history necessary for archivists to develop a vision for their work. Course work in complementary disciplines and new technologies is stressed, ensuring that program graduates remain current with professional trends and developments. New York City offers a unique setting and laboratory for students exploring history and archives, and the program takes full advantage of the city\u2019s repositories in providing internships and practicum experiences for its students. Program graduates work as archivists in a wide variety of academic, nonprofit, corporate, and governmental venues. The program\u2019s unique historical editing component also trains historians for alternative careers in preserving and disseminating historical documents in book, microform, CD-ROM, and electronic formats.    All entering students enroll in a sequential, two-semester colloquium ( G57.1010 and G57.2010) that offers a broad overview of the field and combines classroom instruction with hands-on experience in an archival setting. Over the course of two semesters, students complete a major research paper on an appropriate archival topic and arrange and describe two archival collections in conjunction with their practicum. Students are also required to take a course in historical editing, which focuses on the location, arrangement, and publication of documents. As part of this course, students undertake research to identify and annotate their documentary collection.    M.A. students enroll in a 44-point program of study, leading to the Master of Arts degree in history and to the certificate. Requirements for the M.A. degree and the advanced certificate are 24 points in history (which must include an M.A. seminar) and 20 points in archives. Students are required to complete 12 points in the three core courses G57.1010, G57.1012, and G57.2010. Students successfully completing the program must have 16 points with a grade of B or better. Students with more than 4 points below B are not eligible for the certificate and may not register for additional courses.    Students holding an appropriate master\u2019s degree in a social science or humanities discipline may be accepted into the program on a nondegree, certificate- only basis. Such students are permitted to register for 20 points in archives to complete the requirements. Ph.D. students in history wishing to use archives as a second field are required to complete the three core courses G57.1010, G57.1012, and G57.2010.    Through a consortium arrangement with Long Island University\u2019s Palmer School of Library and Information Science, students are also able to enroll in more library-oriented courses offered at Bobst Library and to apply these credits toward their certificate. Students should check with the director for a complete list ofPalmerSchool offerings.    Enrollment is limited, and admission must be approved by the director of the program.

SPECIAL PROJECTS    The Margaret Sanger Papers Project collects, assembles, and publishes records documenting the life and career of the founder of the American birth control movement. Located in the department since 1987, the Sanger Papers Project microfilmed the Smith College Collections Series, consisting of almost 45,000 documents; in 1995 an additional 9,000 documents gathered in an international search were microfilmed as the Collected Documents Series. Both microfilmed series are being published by University Publications of America, along with a reel guide and index. The project is preparing an electronic edition of the microfilmed documents for distribution on CD-ROM or via the Internet. The project will then work on a four-volume book edition of selected Sanger letters. The project employs graduate assistants and other students. Documents from the Sanger Papers collection are available for student and faculty research and serve as practical examples for the course on historical editing.    For additional information, contact Dr. Esther Katz, codirector/editor of the Margaret Sanger Papers.    The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project is collecting, transcribing, and translating the entire extant public and private correspondence of earlyNew York governor Jacob Leisler (1640-1691) for publication in microfilm and annotated book editions. Considered by some colonial historians as the \u201cFather of American Democracy\u201d and best known for the 1689New York uprising that bears his name, Leisler played a prominent role in the economic and social development of colonial New York and earlyAmerica. Housed in the department since 1988, the Leisler Papers collection contains over 3,000 documents in Dutch, French, German, and English that provide a wealth of information on the Atlantic world in the early modern era. The project employs graduate and other students to assist in making the collection available to scholars and the public.
