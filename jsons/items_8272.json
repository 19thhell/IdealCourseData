Jennifer Arlen '86 works on corporate liability, experimental economics, and medical malpractice.            Alan Sykes is a leading expert on applying economics to legal problems, with a focus on international economic relations.         NYU Law has a cadre of full-time faculty who make law and economics a primary focus of their work. They include Barry Adler, Jennifer Arlen '86, William Allen, Lily Batchelder (on leave), Vicki Been '83, Ryan Bubb, Stephen Choi, Kevin Davis, John Ferejohn, Mark Geistfeld, Clayton Gillette, Robert Howse, Marcel Kahan, Lewis Kornhauser, Florencia Marotta-Wurgler '01, Geoffrey Miller, Richard Revesz, Deborah Schenk, Daniel Shaviro, Alan Sykes, and Katrina Wyman.   Among those are several lawyer-economists\u2014Arlen, Bubb, Choi, Geistfeld, and Kornhauser all have both JDs and PhDs in economics. Their research and teaching range from the economic analysis of law to behavioral economics to the relation between economic and moral theories of tort law.     The depth of scholarship in law and economics is further increased by affiliated and visiting faculty. Adjunct Professor Alan Rechtschaffen teaches Financial Instruments and the Capital Markets. Leading economists, such as Daniel Rubinfeld and Alan Auerbach, participate in the intellectual life of the Law School.   The economic analysis of law is taught throughout the standard curriculum as well as in advanced courses and several colloquia. There are the Colloquium on Law and Economics ; the Colloquium on Law, Economics and Politics ; the Innovation Policy Colloquium ; and the Tax Policy Colloquium .   The Law School\u2019s Center for Law, Economics and Organization promotes interdisciplinary research and teaching in law and economics. Its director, Jennifer Arlen, is a leading proponent of empirical analysis of legal issues, which has recently seen a dramatic growth in popularity, as is Geoffrey Miller, director of the Center for Financial Institutions. The legal community is embracing the empirical approach, says Miller, because \u201cit doesn\u2019t attempt to argue for or against any moral or social objective, but to figure out how the law functions in practice\u2014what its consequences really are. [Empiricism accomplishes this] without being speculative but by actually counting and observing.\u201d ( Read more about Empirical Legal Studies in the Law School magazine .) Miller's Center for Financial Institutions draws on perspectives from law, economics, political science, history, and sociology, and sponsors the annual Global Economic Forum .
