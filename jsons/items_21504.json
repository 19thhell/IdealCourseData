The M.S. in Fundraising and Grantmaking, with a minimum of 39 credits and a maximum of 41 credits, provides you with the fundamentals of fundraising through a required core curriculum. You first choose a concentration in either fundraising or grantmaking. You then select from a group of seminar-style elective courses in specific subject areas based upon your academic and professional interests. You may choose to focus on areas such as the arts, health sciences, higher education, or politics. Internships in the field provide you with hands-on experience, and continuing education coursework is available to broaden your knowledge and your skills. The program culminates with a capstone project, which involves original research and the writing of a master\u2019s thesis based upon your findings.   *Denotes courses offered through the NYU Robert F.
