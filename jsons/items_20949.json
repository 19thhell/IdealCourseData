Congratulations to Tzu-Ying Yu , on the successful November 2010 defense of her dissertation, \"The contribution of haptic and kinesthetic perceptions to handwriting in children ages 6 to 8 years.\" Yu was the recipient of a prestigious Dean's grant to support a pilot study for her dissertation and presented her work at the Dean's Grant for Student Research Colloquium in October of 2010.    In cooperation with the Islamic Center at NYU, students, faculty, and staff of the Department of Occupational Therapy contributed to the relief effort for victims of the recent floods in Pakistan. According to the United Nations, this is the most severe incident of flooding in eighty years, with six million Pakistanis in need of lifesaving assistance. OT students, faculty, and staff donated food items to help those affected by the crisis; five packages containing an assortment of non perishable food items were assembled and will be shipped to Pakistani families in need. The effort was led by 2nd year Occupational Therapy Professional Program student Salma Malik , with the aid Department Administrator Ayanna Lee; Salma would like to extend her thanks to all of the participants who made the effort a success.    In response to the earthquake in Haiti, Steinhardt OT students organized a donation drive this semester to provide self-care products to those in need. The drive was organized under the leadership of Joanna Dritsas and Michelle Carrol , as part of the 2nd-year professional program's class gift, and completed with the help of Department members Ayanna Lee, Karen Buckley, and Sally Poole. For Dritsas and Carrol, it offered a chance to integrate occupational therapy theory into their aid to the Haiti relief effort. They solicited the involvement of OT students, faculty and staff in assembling self-care packages, including toothpaste, soap, and shampoo, to be sent to families affected by the earthquake. A total of 125 supply packages were sent to Haiti through the AFYA Foundation, a humanitarian aid organization founded by Steinhardt OT alumna Danielle Butin ('85).    The NYU Steinhardt Department of Occupational Therapy is pleased to announce the 2010 Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy scholarship recipients- Stacey Suplizio, Jessica Sibley, and Rachel Turner .

The NYU Steinhardt Department of Occupational Therapy is pleased to announce the 2009 Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy scholarship recipients - Susan Braham, Janelle Carbo, and Razia Khan . These three outstanding students have each been selected to receive a $3,000 tuition award for the summer 2009 semester. Funding for the award is derived from interest earned on the Department's endowed Frieda J. Behlen scholarship fund and also from funds raised by NYU OT alumni.    Gwen Weinstock, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, received the American Occupational Therapy Foundation Dissertation Research Grant award for 2008. This prestigious award provides financial support for data collection and analysis. Gwen plans to defend her dissertation in the spring of 2009, with Jane Bear Lehman as the Dissertation Chair, and Jim Hinojosa and Sherri Weiser as committee members .    Tien-Ni Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, earned second prize for her oral presentation at the 27 th Annual Conference of the Taiwan Occupational Therapy Association. The paper that Tien-Ni presented was based on a course taken during the winter session of 2008 at NYU Steinhardt on structure equation modeling and factor analysis. Tien-Ni is currently collecting data for her dissertation in Taiwan.    Shu-Yuan Hu and Rita Fleming-Castaldy both successfully defended their dissertations in November of 2007. Hu defended &ldquo;The Sensory Balance Test as a Screening for Possible Sensory Integration Deficits.&rdquo; In this study, she investigated the relationship between upper extremity stability and motor accuracy in young children.    Fleming-Castaldy also defended her project, &ldquo;Consumer-Directed Personal Care Assistance (PCA) and Quality of Life for Persons with Disabilities.&rdquo; Using a survey design, this study compared the perspectives of persons who use a consumer-directed PCA model to those who use an agency-directed one. The relationships found between self-management and satisfaction with PCA and quality of life support the value of consumer-directed PCA programs for disabled persons.    Students Biked for MS on Sunday, October 14, 2007. NYU OT students participated in a charity bike ride benefiting the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). The MS Bike Tour took riders of all skill levels on routes around the island of Manhattan, with courses ranging between 30 to 100 miles. The NYU team (captained by second-year student Maia Watkins) raised more than $1,300 to support NMSS's educational programs, services, and a national research initiative. Said Assistant Professor Yael Goverover (who also biked in the event), \"We would like to thank all the people who supported us by joining our team or donating to this important cause. It is great to know that our students and faculty are involved in community outreach projects.\"    Joselyn B. Goldstein and Andrea Johnston , students in the Professional M.S. Program, are recipients of Steinhardt&rsquo;s 2007 Samuel Eshborn Service Award.

Tien-Ni Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, earned second prize for her oral presentation at the 27 th Annual Conference of the Taiwan Occupational Therapy Association. The paper that Tien-Ni presented was based on a course taken during the winter session of 2008 at NYU Steinhardt on structure equation modeling and factor analysis. Tien-Ni is currently collecting data for her dissertation in Taiwan.    Shu-Yuan Hu and Rita Fleming-Castaldy both successfully defended their dissertations in November of 2007. Hu defended &ldquo;The Sensory Balance Test as a Screening for Possible Sensory Integration Deficits.&rdquo; In this study, she investigated the relationship between upper extremity stability and motor accuracy in young children.    Fleming-Castaldy also defended her project, &ldquo;Consumer-Directed Personal Care Assistance (PCA) and Quality of Life for Persons with Disabilities.&rdquo; Using a survey design, this study compared the perspectives of persons who use a consumer-directed PCA model to those who use an agency-directed one. The relationships found between self-management and satisfaction with PCA and quality of life support the value of consumer-directed PCA programs for disabled persons.    Students Biked for MS on Sunday, October 14, 2007. NYU OT students participated in a charity bike ride benefiting the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). The MS Bike Tour took riders of all skill levels on routes around the island of Manhattan, with courses ranging between 30 to 100 miles.
