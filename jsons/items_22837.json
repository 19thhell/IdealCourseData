Pre-departure classes in October will provide students with an overview of India\u2019s system of injustices which perpetuate gender-based violence and the impact of class, caste, race, ethnicity, gender and religion of this global movement which oppresses women.         While in India, we will be hosted by Apne Aap, an organization founded by Ruchira Gupta, leading a grassroots movement in India to end sex trafficking.\u00a0 The NGO organizes small groups of women and girls who are at risk of or are affected by trafficking into self-empowerment groups in program areas to access three fundamental rights \u2013 education, sustainable &amp; dignified livelihood and legal empowerment. Self-empowerment groups meet in local safe spaces which offer community classrooms, vocational training units and legal education.\u00a0        By meeting and engaging with these women and girls, students will have a unique opportunity for personal interaction with women in and at risk of prostitution.\u00a0 Site visits to red light districts, slums, shelters, the Gandhi Smriti Museum, the Apne Aap offices and conversations with prostituted women and prosecutors in Delhi and Kolkata, will reveal the everyday life of \u201cthe last girl.\u201d\u00a0     Course Goals and Learning Objectives       By the end of the course, students should be able to:               Recognize the reality of sex trafficking both in India and the US      Effectively identify the root causes of how women become prostituted      Develop models for prevention, protection and prosecution            Gain an understanding of Gandhian philosophy and social justice frames that result in deeper connections and linkages around anti-violence work in the United States      Learn, first hand, what it takes to create social change      Understand how the commercial sex industry is inherently oppressive and inextricably linked with other ways that girls and women experience oppression, violence, and exploitation.

Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.
