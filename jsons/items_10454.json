If you are interested in registering for a course at another NYU graduate school, you should first review the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course List to determine whether the course you are interested has already been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising. If the course is pre-approved, you should follow the procedure listed under the \"Registering for a Pre-Approved Course\" tab on this page. If the course you are interested in has not been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising, you should follow the procedure listed under the \"Registering for a course that is not Pre-Approved\" tab on this page.    A complete list of courses within other NYU divisions, with times and locations, can be found in the NYU Directory of Classes. Students can review the Albert Course Search online. For a list of Law School classes, please go to www.law.nyu.edu .      Eligibility       In order to register for a course at another NYU graduate school, you must have completed your Stern Core requirements or be completing them this semester.    To be eligible to graduate, MBA candidates may not complete more than 15.0 credits outside of Stern. This includes courses taken as part of a study abroad exchange program, courses taken as a visiting student, and courses taken at another NYU divisions.    Stern does not accept credit for online courses, under any circumstances.    New York University students may not pursue two degrees simultaneously at different schools of the University, unless accepted and enrolled into one of the established dual degree programs.      Dual degree students       Dual degree students must account for credit reductions when determining how many non-Stern credits can be taken.    A Dual degree student must complete a minimum of 45 credits at Stern despite their credit reduction. This reduces their applicable credits outside of Stern by the number required at Stern. For example, a dual degree student who is required to take 51 credits at Stern for their dual degree requirement will be able to apply only 6 credits to the MBA requirement from another NYU Division or from Study Abroad.      Grades    Other NYU Division courses approved by Academic Affairs and Advising to count toward the MBA program will be included in the Stern GPA. A student must receive a passing grade to receive credit toward the MBA for a non-Stern course. After registering for a non-Stern NYU elective, the course will appear on the My Program Progress page under \"Courses Not Credited to MBA.\" After a passing grade has been submitted, the NYU course will be moved under the Elective area.      Specializations    Non-Stern courses do not count towards Specializations, with the exception of the Law and Business , Real Estate and Digital Marketing Specializations.      Credit Equivalency    The assignment of Stern credits is based on the number of hours the course meets, which varies by school and, sometimes, by course. To count as three Stern credits, a course must meet at least 36 hours. To count as 1.5 Stern credits, a course must meet at least 18 hours.      Important Guidelines       Seats in courses at other NYU divisions are not guaranteed .    Students pay tuition for these courses through Stern according to their Stern credit equivalence.    It is the student's responsibility to be aware of the add/drop dates and deadlines for any approved courses taken outside of the Stern School of Business . Students must contact the Stern Office of Records and Registration to drop a course at another NYU division.    Non-Stern courses are added during the drop/add period and are not included in the lottery selection .                Registering for a Pre-Approved Course   Once you have reviewed the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course List to confirm that the course you are interested in has been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising, please complete the following procedure to register:       Complete the online request form through the Other NYU Division Courses site . For pre-approved courses, students do NOT need to include a course description or syllabus.    Academic Affairs and Advising will review and process the request. If approved, you will need to determine the availability in the course directly with the NYU division and, if necessary, receive approval from the other NYU division to register for the course. You should then send an email confirmation of the availability/approval to crossregistrn.list@stern.nyu.edu .    Once approval has been issued by Stern and the other NYU division, the Office of Records and Registration will register the student and send a confirmation email.                   Registering for a course that is not Pre-Approved   Note: Non-Stern courses must be at the Masters degree level, must address a business or management subject that is not covered by Stern electives, and must fit clearly into the student's MBA program. Language and undergraduate courses never qualify. It is the student's responsibility to verify course expectations directly with the other NYU division. Students should confirm their ability to handle the coursework before submitting their request.    Online courses are not permitted to count towards the MBA program requirements and will not be approved.      To request approval of a course that does not appear on the pre-approved list:    1) Complete the online form through our Other NYU Division Courses site at least two weeks prior to the first class meeting. (Petitions submitted any later may not be reviewed.)    The following information must be included in the petition (petitions will only be reviewed upon receipt of all below items):       Course description    Syllabus with meeting times, lecture topics and deliverables    A detailed explanation of how the course will enhance or complement the student's academic program and their \"education in possible\"      2) Academic Affairs and Advising will review and process the request. If approved, you will need to determine the availability in the course directly with the NYU division and, if necessary, receive approval from the other NYU division to register for the course. You should then send an email confirmation of the availability/approval to crossregistrn.list@stern.nyu.edu .    Requests will be reviewed by the appropriate advisors and Stern faculty. When submitting a petition, please keep in mind that the Stern faculty has already reviewed and approved courses which they feel are appropriate for Stern MBA students and have included them in the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course list. Students are advised to make sure that the subject matter is not covered in an existing Stern class.    All students registering for courses at the School of Law that are not pre-approved must also fill out the following form and take it to the School of Law and Academic Affairs and Advising for faculty and administrative signatures.    3) Once approval has been issued by Stern and the other NYU division, the Office of Records and Registration will register the student and send a confirmation email.

Essential to this mission is that all members of the University Community are safe and free to engage in a civil process of teaching and learning through their experiences both inside and outside the classroom. Accordingly, no student should engage in any form of behavior that interferes with the academic or educational process, compromises the personal safety or well-being of another, or disrupts the administration of University programs or services. Although any action that is interpreted as being disrespectful, distracting, or even disorderly can be disturbing to others, it may not constitute a form of Disruptive Behavior that is actionable under this policy.  Common examples of Disruptive Behaviors include, but are not limited to:   B) Examples of Disruptive Behavior   Examples of Disruptive Behavior (collectively \u201cDisruptive Behavior\u201d) include, but are not limited to, the following:   \u2022 Academic Disruption/Interference: Behaviors that, by virtue of their intensity and/or repetitiveness, interfere with an academic activity (e.g., class, advising session, lecture, workshop) such as: persistently talking without being recognized; creating noise that obstructs the learning process; repeatedly interrupting others; maliciously or inappropriately mocking or ridiculing another\u2019s work or comments; speaking in an abusive or derogatory manner; engaging in acts of physical aggression (e.g., causing or threatening injury, physical or verbal intimidation, damaging personal/University property, throwing items), or deliberately engaging in other behaviors that have the effect of compromising the learning process.   \u2022 Administrative Disruption/Interference: Behaviors that, by virtue of their intensity and/or repetitiveness, interfere with the effective delivery of administrative programs or services, or create a foreseeable risk of material and substantial disruption of NYU\u2019s programs or services, such as: persistently or obstructively talking, yelling, screaming, or making noises; speaking in an abusive or derogatory manner; maliciously or inappropriately mocking or ridiculing persons who provide or use/seek to use the program/service; or engaging in acts of physical aggression (e.g., causing or threatening injury, physical or verbal intimidation, damaging personal/University property, throwing items); or refusing to adhere to the established procedures associated with the delivery of such programs or services.   \u2022 Individual and Community Disruption/Interference: Behaviors that, by virtue of their intensity and/or repetitiveness, compromise the health, safety or well-being of an individual student or of the general University community, that interfere with the maintenance of public order on campus, or that disrupt the effective continuation of the academic/educational process for individual students or for the general University community by virtue of their severity, pervasiveness, or persistence, such as: a pattern of bullying, threatening, tormenting, mocking, defaming, intimidating, stalking, exploiting known psychological or physical vulnerabilities or impairments; actions that jeopardize another person\u2019s mental, emotional, or physical well-being; acts of aggression (e.g., causing or threatening injury to one\u2019s person or property, physical or verbal intimidation, damaging personal/University property); conduct that unreasonably interferes with a person's academic work or work performance; inciting or attempting to incite violence harassment, or disruption by others; or behavior that compromises the ability of administrators to manage situations in accordance with their role and authority.   C) Guidelines for Response and Enforcement  Allegations of Disruptive Behavior may be subject to review and the possible imposition of penalties in accordance with the student conduct standards, practices, and procedures of the University and its Colleges/Schools/Institutes, and/or divisions. However, it is important to recognize that, as per the above definitions, a single act (e.g. name calling, mocking or harsh words) which causes discomfort to another may not constitute Disruptive Behavior that is subject to University disciplinary action. Nor does being \u201cuncomfortable\u201d automatically translate to being \u201cunsafe\u201d or being \u201cthreatened\u201d. Each allegation of Disruptive Behavior must be examined objectively with respect to its severity, repetitiveness, and tangible impact on the individual and/or the University community in reaching a determination as to whether the act was in violation of paragraphs B.1 and B.2. of the University\u2019s Rules for the Maintenance of Public Order [ www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/rules-for-the-maintenance-of-public-order.html ], or other University policies.   Should the Disruptive Behavior be related to a characteristic of a targeted person that is a legally protected status, the person engaging in the Disruptive Behavior also may be violating the University\u2019s policies on Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Policy or the University\u2019s Anti-Harassment Policy . Situations involving Disruptive Behavior may be addressed as follows:   \u2022 Academic Disruption/Interference: If a student has engaged in Disruptive Behavior, the faculty member is urged to ask the student to cease the behavior and warn the student that failure to do so can result in removal from the class, as well as disciplinary action. Should the student continue the Disruptive Behavior, the faculty member is authorized to ask the student to leave the classroom and, where deemed necessary, to call the NYU Department of Public Safety to assist in the student\u2019s removal from the premises. Should the faculty member believe the circumstances are such that a danger exists that could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm, the faculty member should call the NYU Department of Public Safety or the New York City Police Department for assistance. Whenever a student has been so removed from the classroom, the faculty member should immediately inform the Office of the Dean of the College/School/Institute so that appropriate disciplinary action can be considered. The Office of the Dean of the College/School/Institute in which the student is enrolled may temporarily suspend the student, exclude that student from the classroom, or exclude the student from accessing certain campus facilities or prohibit him/her from having contact with other designated individuals pending resolution of the matter. Should such an action be taken, the student should be informed of the exclusion and offered an expedited review of the matter through the applicable student conduct process.   \u2022 Administrative Disruption/Interference: If a student engages in Disruptive Behavior that interferes with the effective delivery of NYU\u2019s administrative programs or services, an involved administrator should ask the student to cease the Disruptive Behavior and warn the student that failure to do so can result in removal from the office, as well as disciplinary action. If the student persists in the Disruptive Behavior, the administrator is authorized to ask the student to leave the office/service and, if deemed necessary, to call the NYU Department of Public Safety to assist in the student\u2019s removal from the premises. Should the administrator believe the Disruptive Behavior creates a danger of death or serious physical harm, the administrator is urged to call the NYU Department of Public Safety or the New York City Police Department for assistance. Whenever a student has been so removed, the administrator should immediately notify the Office of Community Standards and Compliance so that appropriate disciplinary action can be considered. The Vice President for Student Affairs or the Dean may temporarily exclude that student from the office/service pending resolution of the matter. Should such an action be taken, the student should be informed of the exclusion and offered an expedited review of the matter through the appropriate student conduct process.   \u2022 Individual and Community Disruption/Interference: Any student, faculty member, staff member, or administrator, who believes that he/she, or the general University community, is the target of Disruptive Behavior by a student should ask that student to cease the associated behavior. Should the targeted person believe the Disruptive Behavior creates a danger of death or serious physical harm, he/she should call the NYU Department of Public Safety or the New York City Police Department for assistance. (At a Study Away Site, the person should contact the Site Director or another site administrator who should make the decision whether intervention by the local police is warranted.) The targeted person may file a complaint with the Office of Community Standards and/or the Dean or Director of the College/School/Institute in which the student is enrolled to initiate applicable disciplinary action. (At a Study Away site, the person should contact the Site Director or another site administrator.) The Vice President for Student  Affairs or the Dean/Director may temporarily suspend the student or exclude the student from accessing certain campus facilities or prohibit him/her from having contact with other designated individuals pending resolution of the matter.

If you are interested in registering for a course at another NYU graduate school, you should first review the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course List to determine whether the course you are interested has already been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising. If the course is pre-approved, you should follow the procedure listed under the \"Registering for a Pre-Approved Course\" tab on this page. If the course you are interested in has not been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising, you should follow the procedure listed under the \"Registering for a course that is not Pre-Approved\" tab on this page.    A complete list of courses within other NYU divisions, with times and locations, can be found in the NYU Directory of Classes. Students can review the Albert Course Search online. For a list of Law School classes, please go to www.law.nyu.edu .      Eligibility       In order to register for a course at another NYU graduate school, you must have completed your Stern Core requirements or be completing them this semester.    To be eligible to graduate, MBA candidates may not complete more than 15.0 credits outside of Stern. This includes courses taken as part of a study abroad exchange program, courses taken as a visiting student, and courses taken at another NYU divisions.    Stern does not accept credit for online courses, under any circumstances.    New York University students may not pursue two degrees simultaneously at different schools of the University, unless accepted and enrolled into one of the established dual degree programs.      Dual degree students       Dual degree students must account for credit reductions when determining how many non-Stern credits can be taken.    A Dual degree student must complete a minimum of 45 credits at Stern despite their credit reduction. This reduces their applicable credits outside of Stern by the number required at Stern. For example, a dual degree student who is required to take 51 credits at Stern for their dual degree requirement will be able to apply only 6 credits to the MBA requirement from another NYU Division or from Study Abroad.      Grades    Other NYU Division courses approved by Academic Affairs and Advising to count toward the MBA program will be included in the Stern GPA. A student must receive a passing grade to receive credit toward the MBA for a non-Stern course. After registering for a non-Stern NYU elective, the course will appear on the My Program Progress page under \"Courses Not Credited to MBA.\" After a passing grade has been submitted, the NYU course will be moved under the Elective area.      Specializations    Non-Stern courses do not count towards Specializations, with the exception of the Law and Business , Real Estate and Digital Marketing Specializations.      Credit Equivalency    The assignment of Stern credits is based on the number of hours the course meets, which varies by school and, sometimes, by course. To count as three Stern credits, a course must meet at least 36 hours. To count as 1.5 Stern credits, a course must meet at least 18 hours.      Important Guidelines       Seats in courses at other NYU divisions are not guaranteed .    Students pay tuition for these courses through Stern according to their Stern credit equivalence.    It is the student's responsibility to be aware of the add/drop dates and deadlines for any approved courses taken outside of the Stern School of Business . Students must contact the Stern Office of Records and Registration to drop a course at another NYU division.    Non-Stern courses are added during the drop/add period and are not included in the lottery selection .                Registering for a Pre-Approved Course   Once you have reviewed the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course List to confirm that the course you are interested in has been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising, please complete the following procedure to register:       Complete the online request form through the Other NYU Division Courses site . For pre-approved courses, students do NOT need to include a course description or syllabus.    Academic Affairs and Advising will review and process the request. If approved, you will need to determine the availability in the course directly with the NYU division and, if necessary, receive approval from the other NYU division to register for the course. You should then send an email confirmation of the availability/approval to crossregistrn.list@stern.nyu.edu .    Once approval has been issued by Stern and the other NYU division, the Office of Records and Registration will register the student and send a confirmation email.                   Registering for a course that is not Pre-Approved   Note: Non-Stern courses must be at the Masters degree level, must address a business or management subject that is not covered by Stern electives, and must fit clearly into the student's MBA program. Language and undergraduate courses never qualify. It is the student's responsibility to verify course expectations directly with the other NYU division. Students should confirm their ability to handle the coursework before submitting their request.    Online courses are not permitted to count towards the MBA program requirements and will not be approved.      To request approval of a course that does not appear on the pre-approved list:    1) Complete the online form through our Other NYU Division Courses site at least two weeks prior to the first class meeting. (Petitions submitted any later may not be reviewed.)    The following information must be included in the petition (petitions will only be reviewed upon receipt of all below items):       Course description    Syllabus with meeting times, lecture topics and deliverables    A detailed explanation of how the course will enhance or complement the student's academic program and their \"education in possible\"      2) Academic Affairs and Advising will review and process the request. If approved, you will need to determine the availability in the course directly with the NYU division and, if necessary, receive approval from the other NYU division to register for the course. You should then send an email confirmation of the availability/approval to crossregistrn.list@stern.nyu.edu .    Requests will be reviewed by the appropriate advisors and Stern faculty. When submitting a petition, please keep in mind that the Stern faculty has already reviewed and approved courses which they feel are appropriate for Stern MBA students and have included them in the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course list. Students are advised to make sure that the subject matter is not covered in an existing Stern class.    All students registering for courses at the School of Law that are not pre-approved must also fill out the following form and take it to the School of Law and Academic Affairs and Advising for faculty and administrative signatures.    3) Once approval has been issued by Stern and the other NYU division, the Office of Records and Registration will register the student and send a confirmation email.

The New York, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai campuses form the backbone with faculty and students from each campus spending &quot;semesters away&quot; at one or more of the numerous study abroad sites NYU maintains on five continents.     NYU Abu Dhabi              NYU Shanghai   NYU Shanghai students spend at least five semesters in Shanghai and at least one semester elsewhere in NYU's global network. Students study with superb teachers who nurture their capacity for original, rigorous, and critical thinking, and with diverse and intellectually gifted classmates. They pursue a liberal education in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics. They master the skills of cross-cultural effectiveness in a community where half are from China and half are from other lands. They reflect upon the role that great cities play in human progress, and upon the interdependent relationship between China and the rest of the world.       NYU Shanghai                         Highlighted Centers  and Institutes   NYU offers hundreds of unique opportunities to study with specialized centers or institutes. Some of those centers or institutes will also offer degrees for academic studies and are highlighted here.

Essential to this mission is that all members of the University Community are safe and free to engage in a civil process of teaching and learning through their experiences both inside and outside the classroom. Accordingly, no student should engage in any form of behavior that interferes with the academic or educational process, compromises the personal safety or well-being of another, or disrupts the administration of University programs or services. Although any action that is interpreted as being disrespectful, distracting, or even disorderly can be disturbing to others, it may not constitute a form of Disruptive Behavior that is actionable under this policy.  Common examples of Disruptive Behaviors include, but are not limited to:   B) Examples of Disruptive Behavior   Examples of Disruptive Behavior (collectively \u201cDisruptive Behavior\u201d) include, but are not limited to, the following:   \u2022 Academic Disruption/Interference: Behaviors that, by virtue of their intensity and/or repetitiveness, interfere with an academic activity (e.g., class, advising session, lecture, workshop) such as: persistently talking without being recognized; creating noise that obstructs the learning process; repeatedly interrupting others; maliciously or inappropriately mocking or ridiculing another\u2019s work or comments; speaking in an abusive or derogatory manner; engaging in acts of physical aggression (e.g., causing or threatening injury, physical or verbal intimidation, damaging personal/University property, throwing items), or deliberately engaging in other behaviors that have the effect of compromising the learning process.   \u2022 Administrative Disruption/Interference: Behaviors that, by virtue of their intensity and/or repetitiveness, interfere with the effective delivery of administrative programs or services, or create a foreseeable risk of material and substantial disruption of NYU\u2019s programs or services, such as: persistently or obstructively talking, yelling, screaming, or making noises; speaking in an abusive or derogatory manner; maliciously or inappropriately mocking or ridiculing persons who provide or use/seek to use the program/service; or engaging in acts of physical aggression (e.g., causing or threatening injury, physical or verbal intimidation, damaging personal/University property, throwing items); or refusing to adhere to the established procedures associated with the delivery of such programs or services.   \u2022 Individual and Community Disruption/Interference: Behaviors that, by virtue of their intensity and/or repetitiveness, compromise the health, safety or well-being of an individual student or of the general University community, that interfere with the maintenance of public order on campus, or that disrupt the effective continuation of the academic/educational process for individual students or for the general University community by virtue of their severity, pervasiveness, or persistence, such as: a pattern of bullying, threatening, tormenting, mocking, defaming, intimidating, stalking, exploiting known psychological or physical vulnerabilities or impairments; actions that jeopardize another person\u2019s mental, emotional, or physical well-being; acts of aggression (e.g., causing or threatening injury to one\u2019s person or property, physical or verbal intimidation, damaging personal/University property); conduct that unreasonably interferes with a person's academic work or work performance; inciting or attempting to incite violence harassment, or disruption by others; or behavior that compromises the ability of administrators to manage situations in accordance with their role and authority.   C) Guidelines for Response and Enforcement  Allegations of Disruptive Behavior may be subject to review and the possible imposition of penalties in accordance with the student conduct standards, practices, and procedures of the University and its Colleges/Schools/Institutes, and/or divisions. However, it is important to recognize that, as per the above definitions, a single act (e.g. name calling, mocking or harsh words) which causes discomfort to another may not constitute Disruptive Behavior that is subject to University disciplinary action. Nor does being \u201cuncomfortable\u201d automatically translate to being \u201cunsafe\u201d or being \u201cthreatened\u201d. Each allegation of Disruptive Behavior must be examined objectively with respect to its severity, repetitiveness, and tangible impact on the individual and/or the University community in reaching a determination as to whether the act was in violation of paragraphs B.1 and B.2. of the University\u2019s Rules for the Maintenance of Public Order [ www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/rules-for-the-maintenance-of-public-order.html ], or other University policies.   Should the Disruptive Behavior be related to a characteristic of a targeted person that is a legally protected status, the person engaging in the Disruptive Behavior also may be violating the University\u2019s policies on Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Policy or the University\u2019s Anti-Harassment Policy . Situations involving Disruptive Behavior may be addressed as follows:   \u2022 Academic Disruption/Interference: If a student has engaged in Disruptive Behavior, the faculty member is urged to ask the student to cease the behavior and warn the student that failure to do so can result in removal from the class, as well as disciplinary action. Should the student continue the Disruptive Behavior, the faculty member is authorized to ask the student to leave the classroom and, where deemed necessary, to call the NYU Department of Public Safety to assist in the student\u2019s removal from the premises. Should the faculty member believe the circumstances are such that a danger exists that could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm, the faculty member should call the NYU Department of Public Safety or the New York City Police Department for assistance. Whenever a student has been so removed from the classroom, the faculty member should immediately inform the Office of the Dean of the College/School/Institute so that appropriate disciplinary action can be considered. The Office of the Dean of the College/School/Institute in which the student is enrolled may temporarily suspend the student, exclude that student from the classroom, or exclude the student from accessing certain campus facilities or prohibit him/her from having contact with other designated individuals pending resolution of the matter. Should such an action be taken, the student should be informed of the exclusion and offered an expedited review of the matter through the applicable student conduct process.   \u2022 Administrative Disruption/Interference: If a student engages in Disruptive Behavior that interferes with the effective delivery of NYU\u2019s administrative programs or services, an involved administrator should ask the student to cease the Disruptive Behavior and warn the student that failure to do so can result in removal from the office, as well as disciplinary action. If the student persists in the Disruptive Behavior, the administrator is authorized to ask the student to leave the office/service and, if deemed necessary, to call the NYU Department of Public Safety to assist in the student\u2019s removal from the premises. Should the administrator believe the Disruptive Behavior creates a danger of death or serious physical harm, the administrator is urged to call the NYU Department of Public Safety or the New York City Police Department for assistance. Whenever a student has been so removed, the administrator should immediately notify the Office of Community Standards and Compliance so that appropriate disciplinary action can be considered. The Vice President for Student Affairs or the Dean may temporarily exclude that student from the office/service pending resolution of the matter. Should such an action be taken, the student should be informed of the exclusion and offered an expedited review of the matter through the appropriate student conduct process.   \u2022 Individual and Community Disruption/Interference: Any student, faculty member, staff member, or administrator, who believes that he/she, or the general University community, is the target of Disruptive Behavior by a student should ask that student to cease the associated behavior. Should the targeted person believe the Disruptive Behavior creates a danger of death or serious physical harm, he/she should call the NYU Department of Public Safety or the New York City Police Department for assistance. (At a Study Away Site, the person should contact the Site Director or another site administrator who should make the decision whether intervention by the local police is warranted.) The targeted person may file a complaint with the Office of Community Standards and/or the Dean or Director of the College/School/Institute in which the student is enrolled to initiate applicable disciplinary action. (At a Study Away site, the person should contact the Site Director or another site administrator.) The Vice President for Student  Affairs or the Dean/Director may temporarily suspend the student or exclude the student from accessing certain campus facilities or prohibit him/her from having contact with other designated individuals pending resolution of the matter. Should such an action be taken, the student should be informed of the suspension, exclusion or prohibition and offered an expedited review of the matter through the applicable student conduct process.
