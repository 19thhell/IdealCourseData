When you select a brain mechanism to study, what do you expect to 'understand' and how would you know that you have understood it? 'Understanding' as a cognitive accomplishment is intuitively understood but its meaning in science is debated. With the impressive advances in the armamentarium of neuroscience, the increasing pace of discovery at multiple levels of description, and the integration of such findings into models, discussion of what 'understanding' means in brain research becomes even more timely. This course will address 'understanding' from the point of view of practicing neuroscientists but also drawing on concepts and observations from a multitude of disciplines, including philosophy, history of science, and cognition. The course will combine frontal lectures and discussions, including guest presentations by members of the NYU faculty on what they consider as 'understanding' in their own research program.

Neurodegenerative disorders and brain injury will also be addressed. Finally, examples of cancer and infectious diseases that target the CNS will be presented. For each topic, a clinical overview will be provided, followed by research about underlying mechanisms, based on clinical research or animal models. The course will follow the textbook \"Diseases of the Nervous System\" (S. Gilman, Ed.). The course instructors are research scientists who have expertise in neuroscience and translational research. The major goals of the course will be to introduce clinical topics to graduate students in a context that complements basic neuroscience courses, and provides opportunities to expand their perspectives from basic science to clinically-related endpoints.

Mathematical Aspects of Neurophysiology  NEURL-GA3400, G63.2855   May be repeated for credit.  3 points per term.    This course will focus on neurophysiology and biophysics at the cellular  level; the mechanistic and mathematical descriptions of neuronal dynamics  and input/output properties. Topics will include: ionic channels  (current-voltage relations, gating kinetics, different types),  Hodgkin-Huxley equations and reductions (the action potential, repetitive  firing, bursting, propagation), dendrites (branching cable theory, passive  and active membrane, spines), synapses (transmitter release,  depression/facilitation, plasticity). Both analytical (perturbation and  bifurcation methods) and numerical techniques will be described and used,  serving as an applied introduction to these methodologies. Students will  undertake computing projects related to the course material.        Seminar in Neuroeconomics  NEURL-GA3410   Instructor: Staff   Semester: Spring  3 points per term.    This seminar will survey the emerging field of neuroeconomics, the interdisciplinary study of the brain's mechanisms for decision evaluation and choice. We will approach these issues from multiple perspectives, drawing on theoretical, behavioral, and neural data from economics, psychology, and neurobiology. Major topics include: decision under risk and uncertainty; multiplayer interactions and social preferences; the role of learning in evaluating options; and choice mechanisms.         Disorders of the Nervous system  NEURL-GA4414   Instructor: Staff   Semester: Spring  4 points per term.    This course will address disorders of the nervous system, using examples selected from several of the the major classes of CNS disorders. The first lectures will address developmental disorders, followed by disorders of sensory systems. Subsequently there will be a series of topics that address neurological and psychiatric diseases with complex or heterogeneous etiology, such as schizophrenia and epilepsy. Neurodegenerative disorders and brain injury will also be addressed. Finally, examples of cancer and infectious diseases that target the CNS will be presented. For each topic, a clinical overview will be provided, followed by research about underlying mechanisms, based on clinical research or animal models. The course will follow the textbook \"Diseases of the Nervous System\" (S. Gilman, Ed.). The course instructors are research scientists who have expertise in neuroscience and translational research. The major goals of the course will be to introduce clinical topics to graduate students in a context that complements basic neuroscience courses, and provides opportunities to expand their perspectives from basic science to clinically-related endpoints.             Related Departments      DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY         Genes and Animal Behavior  BIOL-GA1082   Blau  4 points.  Survey of principles and patterns of animal behavior. Covers classical ethological research of Lorenz and others and modern research on the molecular basis of behavior, especially in model systems.

Developmental Neurobiology  BIOL-GA2221   Prerequisite: permission of the instructor.  Desplan, Sanes  4 points.  Recent advances in genetic model systems as well as the development of new tools in vertebrate embryology have allowed much insight into the development of the central nervous system (CNS). This course focuses on the development of well-studied central nervous systems through a comparison of invertebrate and vertebrate species. It provides an in-depth description of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that pattern the CNS. Topics include cell specification, synapse formation, and e-dependent plasticity.

The course meets Mondays from 9:30-10:45 in room Silver 1009G (the Biology office conference room). Each week 1 or 2 papers on the neurobiology of drug addiction are discussed. Topics include molecular mechanisms of addiction in relation to learning and memory; genetic screening for novel candidate mechanisms of addiction in humans and animal models; and neural circuits that underlie addiction.  No exams or required papers; grades are based on quality of presentation and participation in discussion.
