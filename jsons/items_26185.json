ADVANCED SEMINAR IN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 61)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 22 or NEURL-UA 100 and 220.    The objective of this course is to master select topics in perceptual psychology and sensory neuroscience, focusing on visual perception, visual neuroscience and computational neuroscience. This is an interdisciplinary field of science, crossing the boundaries between psychology, biology, physics and engineering. This course is intended for neural science majors and psychology majors that are on track for careers in science and medicine. This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth; visual motion perception; attention and awareness.            INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 62)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10 and 30 or 32 or 34 or 36.    The focus will be on psychology as applied to work, as well as human behavior from the perspective of employees and employers. The course will explore three levels: - the individual, the team, and the organization as a whole. Topics covered will include: employee engagement, satisfaction, identify, esteem, and career interests; hiring and firing; and. motivating and rewarding staff to increase performance and productivity.     Managing human capital from the firm\u2019s perspective involves work-environment culture and climate, and productivity improvement to develop the healthiest organization. Special topics will include the rise in conflict and employee violence, as well as the growing difficulty with work-life balance, diversity, technology and social media opportunities and challenges. We will look at individual differences involved in psychological assessment and testing for recruiting, transfer, promotion and termination. The objective in I/O Psychology is to achieve a balance between employees\u2019 wants and needs, and the firm\u2019s business imperatives.     This class is best suited to those with an interest in and appreciation for business, economics, and quantitative analysis (e.g. Statistics) for informed business decision-making. Those considering careers in Human Resources or advanced graduate study in Psychology and Business will find relevance.                MOTIVATION AND VOLITION (PSYCH-UA 74)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 and 32    The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of being motivated versus lacking motivation and willpower, the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, and cognitive-neuropsychological research as well as the perspective of economics on motivation and volition. We will focus on understanding the interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches, and on designing research that promotes these different lines of thinking.            CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 32    Close relationships are at the core of the human experience. You already have extensive experience with relationships of many sorts \u2013 family bonds, friendships, and probably romantic partnerships as well. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the scientific perspective of close relationships. You will learn how research psychologists apply the scientific method of data collection and analysis to investigate how people experience and think about relationships in general, and romantic relationships specifically. What makes someone attractive? Do we each have one true love out there or is the person you end up with determined by who happens to be around? Is it better to see your romantic partner for who they really are or to see them through rose-colored glasses? How do relationships influence the way you see yourself? This course will address these and related questions from a social psychological perspective.            COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 34    This course will examine how children's thinking develops from infancy through childhood. We will discuss how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills across various domains (e.g., how children learn and think about objects, people, the natural world, and society) and we will examine the major theories and explanations of cognitive growth. This course will include consideration of both classic and contemporary research on cognitive development.            COGNEURO: PRINCIPLES OF FRONTAL LOBE FUNCTIONS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 or 29.    The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we will delve into the issues that have led many clinicians and scientists throughout the years to suspect that the key to understanding what makes us uniquely human depends on understanding the frontal cortex. We will cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.     Two \u2018mock\u2019 endeavors are emphasized in the class and form the majority of basis for evaluation, the oral communication of research results and the written proposal of a research grant.            DATA LITERACY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    We now live in a world where data is ubiquitous and increasingly influential on decision making at all levels of society. However, most people are not able to meaningfully partake in this new world because they are not data-literate. Thus, the goal of this course is to develop data literacy - the ability to obtain, manage, analyze and understand data. Acquiring this critical skill-set unlocks a wide range of career opportunities and provides the foundation of an educated citizenry in the modern world, preparing you for a successful life in a data-based society. To attain this goal, this course provides a gentle introduction to data-related topics, with a particular emphasis on providing a conceptual understanding, actionable knowledge and long-term retention.            EXPERIMENTS IN BEAUTY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    Beauty is famously hard to study scientifically, but students in this hands-on laboratory course will each week formulate beauty-related questions and design and implement experiments to answer them. We also read and discuss one article/chapter each week from authors including Kant, Woolf, Berlin, Donoghue, Kuhn, Quine, and Wittgenstein.            HUMAN SEXUALITY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1    Sexuality is an essential aspect of everyone\u2019s life. It leads to our most important relationships \u2013 with lovers, spouses, and children. It drives much of our social-networking and status seeking behavior. It evokes our strongest passions - lust, love, jealousy, heartbreak, despair, and hope. And depending on a variety of factors, it can be a highly pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, or a destructive force causing physical, mental, and interpersonal suffering. Basic sexual potentials and tendencies have been built into the human species by evolutionary forces. At the same time, processes of socialization and learning play a crucial role in how these basic potentials are developed, experienced, and manifested in each of us.     Sexual science encompasses a large and multi-disciplinary field of theory and research. This course will examine human sexuality primarily from a psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of personality, developmental, social, clinical, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology, and less often also from ethology, anthropology, sociology, history, neurobiology, and public policy. It will cover various aspects of human sexual psychology (sexual capacities, desires, attraction, orientation, attitudes, identities, experiences, and relationships) and how they are shaped by biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors over the course of the human lifespan, from conception to old age. We will also examine theories and methods of sex research, atypical sexualities, sexual dysfunctions, sexual coercion, and the qualities and benefits of good sex.            FROM ILLUSIONS TO INFERENCE: ADVENTURES IN HUMAN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: NONE    Our sensory perception easily falls prey to illusions and biases. It is tempting to think of these as failures of our brain, but they might not be! In fact, they reveal the difficult challenges that our brain faces when interpreting the world, and the clever (and sometimes not so clever) solutions that it comes up with.      In this course, we will use a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known illusions (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, and multisensory) to work towards the central concept of inference: the notion that the brain constantly forms hypotheses about the outside world and computes probabilities over those hypotheses.   We will draw parallels with fun examples from online shopping to medical diagnosis to spam filtering to election forecasting to searching for submarines. There will be a guest lecture about neurological disorders of perception.   We welcome not only students in psychology and neuroscience, but also from other fields (including biology, physics, computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, and engineering).            LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or Instructor Permission    In the first three years of life, children go from helpless creatures, fresh out of the womb, to toddlers with a basic grasp of language and the people and objects in the world around them. How do they do that? This seminar will discuss current issues in language acquisition and cognitive development, exploring nature, nurture, and their interaction.            NEUROECONOMICS AND DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 25 or 29.    This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, drawing broadly on many perspectives including particularly the nexus of psychological, neuroscientific, and economic considerations, but also ethological and computational ones. The course is organized around modules considering decision making in several sorts of tasks; for instance, by foraging animals or by humans in competitive multiplayer interactions.            PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING (PSYCH-UA 300)    This course will cover historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings will draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and will cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ACTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    In the last decade, there has been a surge of research on the mechanisms of human action. This seminar covers most of the basic questions regarding human action: What are the mechanisms by which action plans are acquired (learned), mentally represented, activated, selected, and expressed? The seminar addresses research on motor control, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, biology, as well as cognitive, developmental, social, and motivational psychology. The seminar thus adheres to a multidisciplinary perspective on the analysis of human action.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    This course will provide: (1) an overview of the major substances of abuse; (2) a review of the various psychological approaches to understanding substance use, abuse, and addiction as informed by the cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and behavioral traditions; (3) an in-depth exploration of the major forms of addiction treatment; and (4) an application of this knowledge to the non-substance or behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and addictive sexuality.            SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    This course is aimed at undergraduates who are planning to attend graduate school in psychology or one of the other behavioral sciences. There are few commercially available solutions that are versatile enough to fulfill the diverse needs of researchers in the behavioral sciences. Thus, it is increasingly critical that aspiring research practitioners are capable of doing their own scientific programming and computing. This class is designed to impart these capabilities to aspiring researchers in the behavioral sciences - specifically Psychology - who have no background in programming, computer science or any prior exposure to any programming language. To achieve this goal, we will cover the computational and programming needs across the entire research cascade in the behavioral sciences, from data collection to making publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming, helping you to pursue your future research goals. Language of instruction is Matlab and some Python.            SELF AND SOCIAL JUDGMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    How is the self-concept formed and how do we come to know other people? Students will discuss the role of motivations, cognitive errors and biases, culture, and situational and dispositional influences on how we think about ourselves and other people.            SEMINAR IN THINKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 29    This seminar focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision making. Decision making is a critical part of every person\u2019s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We will examine formal theories of how people /should/ make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision makers. The class is a seminar, and active discussion and class participation are expected.            SOCIAL ATTITUDES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 32    This course will provide an overview of the major theoretical debates and empirical developments in the area of attitudes and evaluation. Students in this class will be directly exposed to many of the core ideas in attitude research by reading many of the classic articles in this literature. The readings will provide an in-depth exploration of key empirical and theoretical breakthroughs. For example, we will explore implicit and explicit attitude-measurement, persuasion, prejudice, and how attitudes shape our thoughts and actions. Students in the course will also discover the relevance of the attitude-theory to situations of everyday life.            SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 and 30 or 32. PSYCH-UA 29 recommended.    This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own ideas and future research in psychology.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 or 32    This course will review theory and research on cognitive and motivational processes underlying judgments and decision making regarding social objects and events. The course will examine how people seek, interpret, and integrate information in making social judgments and decisions. The seminar will discuss models of rational judgment and how cognitive limitations, social stereotypes, emotions, desires, and impulses produce judgmental error and biases. The course will examine how these judgmental phenomena are expressed in everyday life situations.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF VISUAL PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10.    People tacitly assume that they see the world exactly how it is. New research, however, calls this assumption into question and instead suggests our vantage is clouded at best. In this seminar, we discuss research that suggests that visual perception is influenced by the perceiver's cognitions, emotions, goals, motivations, culture, surroundings, and other variables that have been traditionally considered exclusive to social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Students taking this course will read and evaluate the original literature related to these topics. Weekly response papers will inform class discussion of papers. A final paper will be required.            SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 51.    This course will introduce students to the nature of psychotherapy. It will consider the major theories and techniques of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to viewing and discussing videos illustrating different methods of psychotherapy. .           SOCIAL VISION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    We tacitly assume perceptions are veridical representations of reality, that the way we see the world reflects the way it really is. In this class, we discuss research that calls this supposition into question. We will investigate the ways in which and reasons why higher-order, top-down influences constrain perception at multiple stages of perceptual processing including eye movements, directing visual attention, filtration, ambiguity resolution, and interpretation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of social vision for consequential behavior and judgment in domains including jury decision making, policing, relationships, health and fitness, politics, and others.            RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND METHODS (PSYCH-UA 999)    Offered Every Semester. Prerequisites: Permission of Department and PSYCH-UA 10 as well as two (2) other psychology core courses and a GPA of at least 3.0. This course may be repeatable for credit.   Undergraduate students are paired with faculty, advanced graduate students, or other researchers on a one-to-one basis to pursue common research goals in psychology. Undergraduates serve as apprentices on survey, laboratory, clinical, and field research projects and in return receive guidance in reading and developing research skills. Biweekly meetings deal with research methods and design and allow students an opportunity to speak on their research projects. Written assignments include several brief homeworks and a final journal-style research report.               HONORS COURSES    Open only to students who have been admitted to the Psychology Honors Program. Either PSYCH-UA 200 or PSYCH-UA 201 (but not both) may be counted as an advanced elective in the fulfillment of the requirements of the major.            HONORS SEMINAR I (PSYCH-UA 200)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisite: Admission to the psychology honors program.

ADVANCED SEMINAR IN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 61)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 22 or NEURL-UA 100 and 220.    The objective of this course is to master select topics in perceptual psychology and sensory neuroscience, focusing on visual perception, visual neuroscience and computational neuroscience. This is an interdisciplinary field of science, crossing the boundaries between psychology, biology, physics and engineering. This course is intended for neural science majors and psychology majors that are on track for careers in science and medicine. This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth; visual motion perception; attention and awareness.            INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 62)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10 and 30 or 32 or 34 or 36.    The focus will be on psychology as applied to work, as well as human behavior from the perspective of employees and employers. The course will explore three levels: - the individual, the team, and the organization as a whole. Topics covered will include: employee engagement, satisfaction, identify, esteem, and career interests; hiring and firing; and. motivating and rewarding staff to increase performance and productivity.     Managing human capital from the firm\u2019s perspective involves work-environment culture and climate, and productivity improvement to develop the healthiest organization. Special topics will include the rise in conflict and employee violence, as well as the growing difficulty with work-life balance, diversity, technology and social media opportunities and challenges. We will look at individual differences involved in psychological assessment and testing for recruiting, transfer, promotion and termination. The objective in I/O Psychology is to achieve a balance between employees\u2019 wants and needs, and the firm\u2019s business imperatives.     This class is best suited to those with an interest in and appreciation for business, economics, and quantitative analysis (e.g. Statistics) for informed business decision-making. Those considering careers in Human Resources or advanced graduate study in Psychology and Business will find relevance.                MOTIVATION AND VOLITION (PSYCH-UA 74)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 and 32    The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of being motivated versus lacking motivation and willpower, the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, and cognitive-neuropsychological research as well as the perspective of economics on motivation and volition. We will focus on understanding the interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches, and on designing research that promotes these different lines of thinking.            CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 32    Close relationships are at the core of the human experience. You already have extensive experience with relationships of many sorts \u2013 family bonds, friendships, and probably romantic partnerships as well. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the scientific perspective of close relationships. You will learn how research psychologists apply the scientific method of data collection and analysis to investigate how people experience and think about relationships in general, and romantic relationships specifically. What makes someone attractive? Do we each have one true love out there or is the person you end up with determined by who happens to be around? Is it better to see your romantic partner for who they really are or to see them through rose-colored glasses? How do relationships influence the way you see yourself? This course will address these and related questions from a social psychological perspective.            COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 34    This course will examine how children's thinking develops from infancy through childhood. We will discuss how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills across various domains (e.g., how children learn and think about objects, people, the natural world, and society) and we will examine the major theories and explanations of cognitive growth. This course will include consideration of both classic and contemporary research on cognitive development.            COGNEURO: PRINCIPLES OF FRONTAL LOBE FUNCTIONS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 or 29.    The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we will delve into the issues that have led many clinicians and scientists throughout the years to suspect that the key to understanding what makes us uniquely human depends on understanding the frontal cortex. We will cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.     Two \u2018mock\u2019 endeavors are emphasized in the class and form the majority of basis for evaluation, the oral communication of research results and the written proposal of a research grant.            DATA LITERACY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    We now live in a world where data is ubiquitous and increasingly influential on decision making at all levels of society. However, most people are not able to meaningfully partake in this new world because they are not data-literate. Thus, the goal of this course is to develop data literacy - the ability to obtain, manage, analyze and understand data. Acquiring this critical skill-set unlocks a wide range of career opportunities and provides the foundation of an educated citizenry in the modern world, preparing you for a successful life in a data-based society. To attain this goal, this course provides a gentle introduction to data-related topics, with a particular emphasis on providing a conceptual understanding, actionable knowledge and long-term retention.            EXPERIMENTS IN BEAUTY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    Beauty is famously hard to study scientifically, but students in this hands-on laboratory course will each week formulate beauty-related questions and design and implement experiments to answer them. We also read and discuss one article/chapter each week from authors including Kant, Woolf, Berlin, Donoghue, Kuhn, Quine, and Wittgenstein.            HUMAN SEXUALITY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1    Sexuality is an essential aspect of everyone\u2019s life. It leads to our most important relationships \u2013 with lovers, spouses, and children. It drives much of our social-networking and status seeking behavior. It evokes our strongest passions - lust, love, jealousy, heartbreak, despair, and hope. And depending on a variety of factors, it can be a highly pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, or a destructive force causing physical, mental, and interpersonal suffering. Basic sexual potentials and tendencies have been built into the human species by evolutionary forces. At the same time, processes of socialization and learning play a crucial role in how these basic potentials are developed, experienced, and manifested in each of us.     Sexual science encompasses a large and multi-disciplinary field of theory and research. This course will examine human sexuality primarily from a psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of personality, developmental, social, clinical, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology, and less often also from ethology, anthropology, sociology, history, neurobiology, and public policy. It will cover various aspects of human sexual psychology (sexual capacities, desires, attraction, orientation, attitudes, identities, experiences, and relationships) and how they are shaped by biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors over the course of the human lifespan, from conception to old age. We will also examine theories and methods of sex research, atypical sexualities, sexual dysfunctions, sexual coercion, and the qualities and benefits of good sex.            FROM ILLUSIONS TO INFERENCE: ADVENTURES IN HUMAN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: NONE    Our sensory perception easily falls prey to illusions and biases. It is tempting to think of these as failures of our brain, but they might not be! In fact, they reveal the difficult challenges that our brain faces when interpreting the world, and the clever (and sometimes not so clever) solutions that it comes up with.      In this course, we will use a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known illusions (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, and multisensory) to work towards the central concept of inference: the notion that the brain constantly forms hypotheses about the outside world and computes probabilities over those hypotheses.   We will draw parallels with fun examples from online shopping to medical diagnosis to spam filtering to election forecasting to searching for submarines. There will be a guest lecture about neurological disorders of perception.   We welcome not only students in psychology and neuroscience, but also from other fields (including biology, physics, computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, and engineering).            LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or Instructor Permission    In the first three years of life, children go from helpless creatures, fresh out of the womb, to toddlers with a basic grasp of language and the people and objects in the world around them. How do they do that? This seminar will discuss current issues in language acquisition and cognitive development, exploring nature, nurture, and their interaction.            NEUROECONOMICS AND DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 25 or 29.    This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, drawing broadly on many perspectives including particularly the nexus of psychological, neuroscientific, and economic considerations, but also ethological and computational ones. The course is organized around modules considering decision making in several sorts of tasks; for instance, by foraging animals or by humans in competitive multiplayer interactions.            PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING (PSYCH-UA 300)    This course will cover historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings will draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and will cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ACTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    In the last decade, there has been a surge of research on the mechanisms of human action. This seminar covers most of the basic questions regarding human action: What are the mechanisms by which action plans are acquired (learned), mentally represented, activated, selected, and expressed? The seminar addresses research on motor control, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, biology, as well as cognitive, developmental, social, and motivational psychology. The seminar thus adheres to a multidisciplinary perspective on the analysis of human action.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    This course will provide: (1) an overview of the major substances of abuse; (2) a review of the various psychological approaches to understanding substance use, abuse, and addiction as informed by the cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and behavioral traditions; (3) an in-depth exploration of the major forms of addiction treatment; and (4) an application of this knowledge to the non-substance or behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and addictive sexuality.            SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    This course is aimed at undergraduates who are planning to attend graduate school in psychology or one of the other behavioral sciences. There are few commercially available solutions that are versatile enough to fulfill the diverse needs of researchers in the behavioral sciences. Thus, it is increasingly critical that aspiring research practitioners are capable of doing their own scientific programming and computing. This class is designed to impart these capabilities to aspiring researchers in the behavioral sciences - specifically Psychology - who have no background in programming, computer science or any prior exposure to any programming language. To achieve this goal, we will cover the computational and programming needs across the entire research cascade in the behavioral sciences, from data collection to making publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming, helping you to pursue your future research goals. Language of instruction is Matlab and some Python.            SELF AND SOCIAL JUDGMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    How is the self-concept formed and how do we come to know other people? Students will discuss the role of motivations, cognitive errors and biases, culture, and situational and dispositional influences on how we think about ourselves and other people.            SEMINAR IN THINKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 29    This seminar focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision making. Decision making is a critical part of every person\u2019s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We will examine formal theories of how people /should/ make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision makers. The class is a seminar, and active discussion and class participation are expected.            SOCIAL ATTITUDES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 32    This course will provide an overview of the major theoretical debates and empirical developments in the area of attitudes and evaluation. Students in this class will be directly exposed to many of the core ideas in attitude research by reading many of the classic articles in this literature. The readings will provide an in-depth exploration of key empirical and theoretical breakthroughs. For example, we will explore implicit and explicit attitude-measurement, persuasion, prejudice, and how attitudes shape our thoughts and actions. Students in the course will also discover the relevance of the attitude-theory to situations of everyday life.            SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 and 30 or 32. PSYCH-UA 29 recommended.    This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own ideas and future research in psychology.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 or 32    This course will review theory and research on cognitive and motivational processes underlying judgments and decision making regarding social objects and events. The course will examine how people seek, interpret, and integrate information in making social judgments and decisions. The seminar will discuss models of rational judgment and how cognitive limitations, social stereotypes, emotions, desires, and impulses produce judgmental error and biases. The course will examine how these judgmental phenomena are expressed in everyday life situations.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF VISUAL PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10.    People tacitly assume that they see the world exactly how it is. New research, however, calls this assumption into question and instead suggests our vantage is clouded at best. In this seminar, we discuss research that suggests that visual perception is influenced by the perceiver's cognitions, emotions, goals, motivations, culture, surroundings, and other variables that have been traditionally considered exclusive to social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Students taking this course will read and evaluate the original literature related to these topics. Weekly response papers will inform class discussion of papers. A final paper will be required.            SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 51.    This course will introduce students to the nature of psychotherapy. It will consider the major theories and techniques of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to viewing and discussing videos illustrating different methods of psychotherapy. .           SOCIAL VISION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    We tacitly assume perceptions are veridical representations of reality, that the way we see the world reflects the way it really is. In this class, we discuss research that calls this supposition into question. We will investigate the ways in which and reasons why higher-order, top-down influences constrain perception at multiple stages of perceptual processing including eye movements, directing visual attention, filtration, ambiguity resolution, and interpretation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of social vision for consequential behavior and judgment in domains including jury decision making, policing, relationships, health and fitness, politics, and others.            RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND METHODS (PSYCH-UA 999)    Offered Every Semester. Prerequisites: Permission of Department and PSYCH-UA 10 as well as two (2) other psychology core courses and a GPA of at least 3.0. This course may be repeatable for credit.   Undergraduate students are paired with faculty, advanced graduate students, or other researchers on a one-to-one basis to pursue common research goals in psychology. Undergraduates serve as apprentices on survey, laboratory, clinical, and field research projects and in return receive guidance in reading and developing research skills. Biweekly meetings deal with research methods and design and allow students an opportunity to speak on their research projects. Written assignments include several brief homeworks and a final journal-style research report.               HONORS COURSES    Open only to students who have been admitted to the Psychology Honors Program. Either PSYCH-UA 200 or PSYCH-UA 201 (but not both) may be counted as an advanced elective in the fulfillment of the requirements of the major.

This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth; visual motion perception; attention and awareness.            INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 62)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10 and 30 or 32 or 34 or 36.    The focus will be on psychology as applied to work, as well as human behavior from the perspective of employees and employers. The course will explore three levels: - the individual, the team, and the organization as a whole. Topics covered will include: employee engagement, satisfaction, identify, esteem, and career interests; hiring and firing; and. motivating and rewarding staff to increase performance and productivity.     Managing human capital from the firm\u2019s perspective involves work-environment culture and climate, and productivity improvement to develop the healthiest organization. Special topics will include the rise in conflict and employee violence, as well as the growing difficulty with work-life balance, diversity, technology and social media opportunities and challenges. We will look at individual differences involved in psychological assessment and testing for recruiting, transfer, promotion and termination. The objective in I/O Psychology is to achieve a balance between employees\u2019 wants and needs, and the firm\u2019s business imperatives.     This class is best suited to those with an interest in and appreciation for business, economics, and quantitative analysis (e.g. Statistics) for informed business decision-making. Those considering careers in Human Resources or advanced graduate study in Psychology and Business will find relevance.                MOTIVATION AND VOLITION (PSYCH-UA 74)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 and 32    The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of being motivated versus lacking motivation and willpower, the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, and cognitive-neuropsychological research as well as the perspective of economics on motivation and volition. We will focus on understanding the interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches, and on designing research that promotes these different lines of thinking.            CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 32    Close relationships are at the core of the human experience. You already have extensive experience with relationships of many sorts \u2013 family bonds, friendships, and probably romantic partnerships as well. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the scientific perspective of close relationships. You will learn how research psychologists apply the scientific method of data collection and analysis to investigate how people experience and think about relationships in general, and romantic relationships specifically. What makes someone attractive? Do we each have one true love out there or is the person you end up with determined by who happens to be around? Is it better to see your romantic partner for who they really are or to see them through rose-colored glasses? How do relationships influence the way you see yourself? This course will address these and related questions from a social psychological perspective.            COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 34    This course will examine how children's thinking develops from infancy through childhood. We will discuss how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills across various domains (e.g., how children learn and think about objects, people, the natural world, and society) and we will examine the major theories and explanations of cognitive growth. This course will include consideration of both classic and contemporary research on cognitive development.            COGNEURO: PRINCIPLES OF FRONTAL LOBE FUNCTIONS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 or 29.    The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we will delve into the issues that have led many clinicians and scientists throughout the years to suspect that the key to understanding what makes us uniquely human depends on understanding the frontal cortex. We will cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.     Two \u2018mock\u2019 endeavors are emphasized in the class and form the majority of basis for evaluation, the oral communication of research results and the written proposal of a research grant.            DATA LITERACY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    We now live in a world where data is ubiquitous and increasingly influential on decision making at all levels of society. However, most people are not able to meaningfully partake in this new world because they are not data-literate. Thus, the goal of this course is to develop data literacy - the ability to obtain, manage, analyze and understand data. Acquiring this critical skill-set unlocks a wide range of career opportunities and provides the foundation of an educated citizenry in the modern world, preparing you for a successful life in a data-based society. To attain this goal, this course provides a gentle introduction to data-related topics, with a particular emphasis on providing a conceptual understanding, actionable knowledge and long-term retention.            EXPERIMENTS IN BEAUTY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    Beauty is famously hard to study scientifically, but students in this hands-on laboratory course will each week formulate beauty-related questions and design and implement experiments to answer them. We also read and discuss one article/chapter each week from authors including Kant, Woolf, Berlin, Donoghue, Kuhn, Quine, and Wittgenstein.            HUMAN SEXUALITY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1    Sexuality is an essential aspect of everyone\u2019s life. It leads to our most important relationships \u2013 with lovers, spouses, and children. It drives much of our social-networking and status seeking behavior. It evokes our strongest passions - lust, love, jealousy, heartbreak, despair, and hope. And depending on a variety of factors, it can be a highly pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, or a destructive force causing physical, mental, and interpersonal suffering. Basic sexual potentials and tendencies have been built into the human species by evolutionary forces. At the same time, processes of socialization and learning play a crucial role in how these basic potentials are developed, experienced, and manifested in each of us.     Sexual science encompasses a large and multi-disciplinary field of theory and research. This course will examine human sexuality primarily from a psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of personality, developmental, social, clinical, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology, and less often also from ethology, anthropology, sociology, history, neurobiology, and public policy. It will cover various aspects of human sexual psychology (sexual capacities, desires, attraction, orientation, attitudes, identities, experiences, and relationships) and how they are shaped by biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors over the course of the human lifespan, from conception to old age. We will also examine theories and methods of sex research, atypical sexualities, sexual dysfunctions, sexual coercion, and the qualities and benefits of good sex.            FROM ILLUSIONS TO INFERENCE: ADVENTURES IN HUMAN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: NONE    Our sensory perception easily falls prey to illusions and biases. It is tempting to think of these as failures of our brain, but they might not be! In fact, they reveal the difficult challenges that our brain faces when interpreting the world, and the clever (and sometimes not so clever) solutions that it comes up with.      In this course, we will use a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known illusions (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, and multisensory) to work towards the central concept of inference: the notion that the brain constantly forms hypotheses about the outside world and computes probabilities over those hypotheses.   We will draw parallels with fun examples from online shopping to medical diagnosis to spam filtering to election forecasting to searching for submarines. There will be a guest lecture about neurological disorders of perception.   We welcome not only students in psychology and neuroscience, but also from other fields (including biology, physics, computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, and engineering).            LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or Instructor Permission    In the first three years of life, children go from helpless creatures, fresh out of the womb, to toddlers with a basic grasp of language and the people and objects in the world around them. How do they do that? This seminar will discuss current issues in language acquisition and cognitive development, exploring nature, nurture, and their interaction.            NEUROECONOMICS AND DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 25 or 29.    This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, drawing broadly on many perspectives including particularly the nexus of psychological, neuroscientific, and economic considerations, but also ethological and computational ones. The course is organized around modules considering decision making in several sorts of tasks; for instance, by foraging animals or by humans in competitive multiplayer interactions.            PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING (PSYCH-UA 300)    This course will cover historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings will draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and will cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ACTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    In the last decade, there has been a surge of research on the mechanisms of human action. This seminar covers most of the basic questions regarding human action: What are the mechanisms by which action plans are acquired (learned), mentally represented, activated, selected, and expressed? The seminar addresses research on motor control, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, biology, as well as cognitive, developmental, social, and motivational psychology. The seminar thus adheres to a multidisciplinary perspective on the analysis of human action.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    This course will provide: (1) an overview of the major substances of abuse; (2) a review of the various psychological approaches to understanding substance use, abuse, and addiction as informed by the cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and behavioral traditions; (3) an in-depth exploration of the major forms of addiction treatment; and (4) an application of this knowledge to the non-substance or behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and addictive sexuality.            SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    This course is aimed at undergraduates who are planning to attend graduate school in psychology or one of the other behavioral sciences. There are few commercially available solutions that are versatile enough to fulfill the diverse needs of researchers in the behavioral sciences. Thus, it is increasingly critical that aspiring research practitioners are capable of doing their own scientific programming and computing. This class is designed to impart these capabilities to aspiring researchers in the behavioral sciences - specifically Psychology - who have no background in programming, computer science or any prior exposure to any programming language. To achieve this goal, we will cover the computational and programming needs across the entire research cascade in the behavioral sciences, from data collection to making publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming, helping you to pursue your future research goals. Language of instruction is Matlab and some Python.            SELF AND SOCIAL JUDGMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    How is the self-concept formed and how do we come to know other people? Students will discuss the role of motivations, cognitive errors and biases, culture, and situational and dispositional influences on how we think about ourselves and other people.            SEMINAR IN THINKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 29    This seminar focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision making. Decision making is a critical part of every person\u2019s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We will examine formal theories of how people /should/ make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision makers. The class is a seminar, and active discussion and class participation are expected.            SOCIAL ATTITUDES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 32    This course will provide an overview of the major theoretical debates and empirical developments in the area of attitudes and evaluation. Students in this class will be directly exposed to many of the core ideas in attitude research by reading many of the classic articles in this literature. The readings will provide an in-depth exploration of key empirical and theoretical breakthroughs. For example, we will explore implicit and explicit attitude-measurement, persuasion, prejudice, and how attitudes shape our thoughts and actions. Students in the course will also discover the relevance of the attitude-theory to situations of everyday life.            SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 and 30 or 32. PSYCH-UA 29 recommended.    This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own ideas and future research in psychology.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 or 32    This course will review theory and research on cognitive and motivational processes underlying judgments and decision making regarding social objects and events. The course will examine how people seek, interpret, and integrate information in making social judgments and decisions. The seminar will discuss models of rational judgment and how cognitive limitations, social stereotypes, emotions, desires, and impulses produce judgmental error and biases. The course will examine how these judgmental phenomena are expressed in everyday life situations.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF VISUAL PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10.    People tacitly assume that they see the world exactly how it is. New research, however, calls this assumption into question and instead suggests our vantage is clouded at best. In this seminar, we discuss research that suggests that visual perception is influenced by the perceiver's cognitions, emotions, goals, motivations, culture, surroundings, and other variables that have been traditionally considered exclusive to social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Students taking this course will read and evaluate the original literature related to these topics. Weekly response papers will inform class discussion of papers. A final paper will be required.            SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 51.    This course will introduce students to the nature of psychotherapy. It will consider the major theories and techniques of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to viewing and discussing videos illustrating different methods of psychotherapy. .           SOCIAL VISION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    We tacitly assume perceptions are veridical representations of reality, that the way we see the world reflects the way it really is. In this class, we discuss research that calls this supposition into question. We will investigate the ways in which and reasons why higher-order, top-down influences constrain perception at multiple stages of perceptual processing including eye movements, directing visual attention, filtration, ambiguity resolution, and interpretation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of social vision for consequential behavior and judgment in domains including jury decision making, policing, relationships, health and fitness, politics, and others.            RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND METHODS (PSYCH-UA 999)    Offered Every Semester. Prerequisites: Permission of Department and PSYCH-UA 10 as well as two (2) other psychology core courses and a GPA of at least 3.0. This course may be repeatable for credit.   Undergraduate students are paired with faculty, advanced graduate students, or other researchers on a one-to-one basis to pursue common research goals in psychology. Undergraduates serve as apprentices on survey, laboratory, clinical, and field research projects and in return receive guidance in reading and developing research skills. Biweekly meetings deal with research methods and design and allow students an opportunity to speak on their research projects. Written assignments include several brief homeworks and a final journal-style research report.               HONORS COURSES    Open only to students who have been admitted to the Psychology Honors Program. Either PSYCH-UA 200 or PSYCH-UA 201 (but not both) may be counted as an advanced elective in the fulfillment of the requirements of the major.            HONORS SEMINAR I (PSYCH-UA 200)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisite: Admission to the psychology honors program.

Designed to familiarize students with a modern approach to industrial organization economics. The modern approach relies extensively on the use of game-theoretic tools to model strategic market behavior and the use of econometric methods for testing hypotheses regarding firm conduct and market performance. In particular, the course analyzes profit-maximizing business strategies of firms with market power, as well as strategic interactions among firms in various types of imperfectly competitive markets. The course addresses both static modes of competition as well as dynamic competition in research and development and product design. The course also examines the scope of effective public policies designed to improve market performance. Throughout the course, mathematical-based models are used to develop the relevant concepts and test the pertinent theories of firm behavior.

Behavioral Economics (P)   ECON-UA 342 Prerequisites: Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380) and Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212); or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces students to the field of behavioral economics, which seeks to insert more behavioral realism into economic theory. Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, prospect theory, mental accounting, other-regarding preferences, and hyperbolic discounting. We usually approach a topic by examining evidence of some departure from the assumptions made in the canonical economic model. We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?

Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experiments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.    Elements of Financial Economics (T)   ECON-UA 363 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Restriction: open to students from the Stern School of Business only if FINC-UB 43 has not been taken. Offered every year. 4 points.   Provides theoretical tools for understanding the operation and economic role of asset markets in the financial system. Develops the theory of decision making under uncertainty and techniques for portfolio choice and efficient risk sharing. Develops static and dynamic models of asset markets with applications to efficiency, arbitrage pricing, and the use and pricing of derivative securities.    Advanced Micro Theory (T)   ECON-UA 365 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every other year. 4 points.   Designed to introduce students to some of the main model-building techniques that have been developed by microeconomists. Intended for advanced undergraduates who have taken the necessary preparatory courses in economics and mathematics. Three basic topics are covered. The first topic is the static theory of consumer behavior both in a certain world and in an uncertain world. The second topic is the theory of general equilibrium. The third topic is the theory of dynamic optimization. In addition to the coverage of the economics, the advanced mathematical techniques that are needed to understand the material are reviewed.    Advanced Macroeconomics and Finance (T)   ECON-UA 367 Prerequisites: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11), Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points.   Studies dynamic theories of equilibrium with optimizing agents who face risky returns and uncertain government policies that influence their decisions. We study inflations and hyperinflations; theories of pricing bonds and equity and how well they work empirically; Social Security reform; causes and cures of financial panics; theories of optimal monetary and fiscal policy; and search theory and other applications of dynamic programming.    Financial Economics (P)   ECON-UA 368 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Restriction: not open to students from the Stern School of Business. Offered every year. 4 points.   Provides theoretical and practical tools for understanding the operation of financial markets, the meaning of risk, and its relation to financial return. Also develops concepts of systematic versus idiosyncratic risk, market efficiency, the equilibrium determination of interest rates both in the overnight, interbank lending market and in the market for corporate debt, term and default premia in the bond market, and average excess stock returns in the equity market.    Topics in Economic Theory (T)   ECON-UA 375 Prerequisites: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13). May not be taken for credit in addition to ECON-UA 370. Offered every year. 4 points.   Explores issues in economic theory using the tools learned in macroeconomics and microeconomics. Focuses on a particular issue each term.    Topics in Economic Analysis II (P)   ECON-UA 390 Prerequisites: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and/or Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Offered every year. 4 points.   An advanced undergraduate elective course offered to encourage department or visiting faculty who wish to give courses in fields that are not in the permanent course offerings. The exact topic of this course is announced before registration each year. Such \"topics courses\" are not given regularly and a specific topic presented in any one semester is unlikely to be repeated. Students are allowed to count only one such topics course for the major.    Advanced Econometrics (P, T)   ECON-UA 402 Prerequisite: Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) or Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380). Offered every year. 4 points.   Covers a range of techniques in econometrics that are widely used in applied microeconomics, macroeconomics, and other fields. Although this is a course designed for honors economics majors, students who are not pursuing honors but still satisfy the GPA requirements (3.65 overall and in economics courses) and meet the prerequisite are encouraged to take this course. The class aims at preparing students for carrying out empirical research in economics, and there is emphasis on the relationship between economic models and observable data. We cover nonlinear methods, and a selection of topics in panel and time-series data.        Honors and Independent Study    Honors Tutorial (P, T)   ECON-UA 410 Prerequisites: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10), Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12) and Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380); or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11), Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266); 3.65 GPA in the major and the College; permission of the instructor required. Restriction: open only to students in the honors track. Offered in the fall. 4 points.   Aims to train students to write on economic topics and perform economic analysis efficiently, as well as to develop theoretical skills. This course is in preparation for and is a prerequisite to the Honors Thesis (ECON-UA 450) course. Once a week, two students each present a paper on their original research. The students not presenting that week, as well as the instructor, critique the content and the form of the paper as well as the presentation. Each paper is to be revised and submitted to the instructor with a cover sheet that indicates how the student dealt with each of the criticisms.    Honors Thesis (P, T)   ECON-UA 450 Formerly ECON-UA 400. Prerequisite: Honors Tutorial (ECON-UA 410); 3.65 GPA in the major and the College. Restriction: open only to students in the honors track. Offered in the spring. 4 points.   Students interested in pursuing an Honors Thesis should meet with the director of undergraduate studies in the spring semester of their junior year.    Independent Study (P, T)   ECON-UA 997, 998 Prerequisites: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12); or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13); 3.5 GPA; and permission of the director of undergraduate studies. Restrictions: No more than a total of 8 points of independent study may be taken; independent study does not count towards the major requirements. Offered every semester. 1 to 4 points per term.   The student engages in intensive independent study of an important economic topic under the direction of a departmental faculty member. The results of the study are embodied in a report or paper to be specified required by the instructor.
