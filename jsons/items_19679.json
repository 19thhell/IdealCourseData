Various genetic engineering, tracing, functional manipulation, in vivo electrophysiological recording and computational tools are combined to dissect the neural circuits in a great detail.                                                                                                                                           &copy; 2010 Lin Lab"}, {"content": "SIF | Chemistry | NYU                                         NEW YORK UNIVERSITY       ARTS AND SCIENCE       COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE       GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE                                                Back to  previous page                            Shared Instrumentation Facility      The Chemistry Department Shared Instrumentation Facility is housed in Room 357 of the Brown Building and is staffed by Dr. Chin Lin , Dr. Chunhua Hu , and Mr. Ronald McLurkin .
