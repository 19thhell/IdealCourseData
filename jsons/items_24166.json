Even the appearance of a conflict can be damaging to the reputation of NYU. All decisions by Trustees, Officers, and Senior Administrators must be made solely in the best interests of NYU.   NYU recognizes that situations may on occasion arise where a Covered Person\u2019s private interests conflict with or appear to conflict with his or her obligations to NYU or the interests of NYU. This policy identifies and clarifies the standards and responsibilities related to Conflicts of Interest.               Scope of this Policy    This policy applies to the Trustees, Officers, and Senior Administrators of New York University (the \u201cUniversity\u201d) and of University Affiliates (together, \u201cCovered Persons\u201d). The University\u2019s Audit and Compliance Committee may exempt a University Affiliate from compliance with this policy as set forth in the \u201cUniversity Affiliates\u201d section of this policy.             Procedures for Implementation    Covered Persons must act solely to promote the best interests of NYU. Covered Persons should seek to avoid Conflicts of Interest. A \u201cConflict of Interest\u201d is any circumstance in which the personal, professional, financial, or other interests of a Covered Person may potentially or actually diverge from, or may be reasonably perceived as potentially or actually diverging from, his or her obligations to NYU and the interests of NYU. It includes indirect conflicts, such as benefits provided to a Relative of a Covered Person. Where a Conflict of Interest has been identified, a Covered Person must disclose the Conflict of Interest and, where relevant, cooperate with any plan adopted by NYU to manage, reduce, or eliminate the Conflict of Interest.   The following is not a comprehensive list of the types of Conflicts of Interest that may arise but provides examples of some common types:   (1) Business Arrangements . (a) Related Party Transactions; or (b) participating, directly or indirectly, in the selection, approval, facilitation, or administration of any business arrangement involving NYU and an enterprise in which the Covered Person and/or Relatives hold, directly or indirectly, more than a de minimis ownership or other financial interest or have an employment, management, or fiduciary role (such as serving as an officer or director). A de minimis interest for purposes of (b) is (i) an interest in diversified investment vehicles, such as broad-based mutual funds and exchange traded funds, where the Covered Person and his or her Relatives, collectively, do not have a 15 percent or greater direct or indirect interest in the vehicle or an employment, management, or fiduciary role in the vehicle; and (ii) an interest of up to five percent ownership in any class of a company\u2019s securities or other indicia of ownership provided that such ownership interest would not be reasonably expected to influence or give the appearance of influencing the actions of the Covered Person. For example, where a Covered Person has a less than five percent ownership interest in a start-up company that is seeking to license intellectual property rights from NYU that are critical to the company, such ownership might influence or give the appearance of influencing the actions of the Covered Person.   (2) Competing with NYU . Engaging, directly or indirectly, in activities that are in competition with NYU or appropriating or diverting business opportunities of NYU. This includes (a) holding, directly or indirectly, an ownership or other financial interest (other than a de minimis interest as described in (1(b) above) or having an employment, management, or fiduciary role (such as serving as an officer or director) in an enterprise that is a competitor of NYU, or seeking to advance the interests of such enterprise to the NYU community; and (b) appropriating or diverting a business or financial opportunity that a Covered Person knows or should know NYU is pursuing or is considering pursuing or reasonably might be interested in pursuing if it were aware of the opportunity.   (3) Gifts . (a) Accepting any gift or favor, even of nominal value, that is illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies; or (b) accepting a gift or favor of more than nominal value (including entertainment) or a loan (other than an arm\u2019s length loan made in the ordinary course of business from a banking or other financial institution), even where not illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies, from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU (e.g., seeking to do business or continuing to do business with NYU, seeking to have a student admitted to NYU) if the offer or acceptance of the gift, favor, or loan could reasonably be viewed as intended to influence NYU to act favorably toward the person or entity. Where it is impracticable for a Covered Person (or Relative) to decline a gift that would otherwise constitute a Conflict of Interest under this policy, and where it is neither illegal nor unethical for NYU itself to accept the gift, the Covered Person may accept the gift on behalf of NYU and transfer it to NYU. In such case, the Covered Person should contact the Senior Vice President for University Development and Alumni Relations to discuss the transfer of the gift to NYU or, if applicable, the University Affiliate\u2019s chief development officer. NYU Senior Administrators may not accept gifts of more than nominal value or loans from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU, even without the appearance of any intent to influence, without the consent of their supervisors.   (4) Improper Use of NYU Resources . Unauthorized use of NYU resources, including the services of University employees, for personal purposes. For example, a Covered Person may make de minimis use of NYU computers and telephone devices for personal purposes provided, however, that he or she reimburses NYU if there are additional charges to NYU from such use (e.g., a charge for an international phone call). On the other hand, a Covered Person may not use NYU students or staff to conduct personal business.   (5) Confidential Information . Obtaining, using, or disclosing NYU Confidential Information for direct or indirect personal interest, profit, or advantage; obtaining or using NYU Confidential Information for a purpose that may be detrimental to NYU; or disclosing NYU Confidential Information to a person or entity that is not authorized by NYU to receive it.   Disclosing Conflicts of Interest   Covered Persons have a duty to disclose on an ongoing basis any current, proposed, or pending situations that may constitute a Conflict of Interest, including but not limited to a proposed Related Party Transaction. Covered Persons should disclose the material facts relating to any Conflict of Interest as soon as the existence of a possible Conflict of Interest is known; and in all events, must disclose the material facts relating to any Related Party Transaction prior to entering into the transaction. There are, of course, occasional situations where a Covered Person is not aware of a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis. Where a Covered Person becomes aware that he or she has not disclosed a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis, the Covered Person has a continuing duty to disclose it as promptly as possible thereafter.    Disclosures should be made in full (including the precise nature of the Covered Person\u2019s interest and/or involvement) to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University, who will advise the Audit and Compliance Committee, normally through its Chair or another member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair.   Each year, every Covered Person must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable annual disclosure form or forms then in effect. In addition, prior to the initial election of a Trustee, such individual must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable disclosure form or forms then in effect. The General Counsel and Secretary of the University will provide a copy of all completed disclosure forms to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee.  Process Relating to Conflicts of Interest   If the General Counsel and Secretary of the University (or a lawyer in the Office of General Counsel designated by the General Counsel and Secretary of the University) and Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee (or a member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair) determine that a Covered Person has a Conflict of Interest that may need to be managed, reduced, or eliminated, the Audit and Compliance Committee will determine the next steps with respect to the Conflict of Interest. The Audit and Compliance Committee may determine that the Conflict of Interest should be managed, reduced, or eliminated, or the Audit and Compliance Committee may proceed without a management plan. Any management plan will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the specific matter. The existence and resolution of the Conflict of Interest must be documented in the records of the meeting at which it was discussed or voted upon. The Office of Compliance and Risk Management, among other resources, is available upon request to conduct investigations with respect to matters relating to Conflicts of Interest.   Any Conflict of Interest that is a Related Party Transaction must comply with the following process: A Related Party Transaction not solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative may only be entered into following approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee after the Audit and Compliance Committee has made a determination that the Related Party Transaction is fair, reasonable, and in NYU\u2019s best interest at the time of such determination. In such cases where a Related Party has a substantial financial interest, the Audit and Compliance Committee must, prior to NYU\u2019s entering into the transaction, (1) consider alternatives to the transaction to the extent available; (2) approve the transaction by not less than a majority vote of the Audit and Compliance Committee members present at the meeting; and (3) contemporaneously document in writing the basis for the Audit and Compliance Committee\u2019s approval, including its consideration of alternative transactions. With respect to a Related Party Transaction solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative, the Compensation Committee of the University normally will make the determination and undertake the process set forth above.   Depending on its nature, a matter giving rise to a Conflict of Interest, including a Related Party Transaction, may be subject to approval by the Board of Trustees and/or be subject to approval or recommendation by a committee of the Board of Trustees other than the Audit and Compliance or Compensation Committee. In such case, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee may make its approval or recommendation either before or after the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be, undertakes the process set forth above; if before, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee\u2019s approval must be subject to the determination of the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be.   In no event may a Covered Person with a Conflict of Interest be present at or participate in the deliberation or vote by the Board of Trustees, or committee thereof, on the matter giving rise to the Conflict of Interest, such as the Covered Person\u2019s compensation by the University, or attempt to influence improperly the deliberation or voting on the matter. A Covered Person may, where requested by the Board of Trustees or applicable committee, be present at the meeting prior to the commencement of deliberations or vote on the matter in order to present information or answer questions concerning the Conflict of Interest.

This includes (a) holding, directly or indirectly, an ownership or other financial interest (other than a de minimis interest as described in (1(b) above) or having an employment, management, or fiduciary role (such as serving as an officer or director) in an enterprise that is a competitor of NYU, or seeking to advance the interests of such enterprise to the NYU community; and (b) appropriating or diverting a business or financial opportunity that a Covered Person knows or should know NYU is pursuing or is considering pursuing or reasonably might be interested in pursuing if it were aware of the opportunity.   (3) Gifts . (a) Accepting any gift or favor, even of nominal value, that is illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies; or (b) accepting a gift or favor of more than nominal value (including entertainment) or a loan (other than an arm\u2019s length loan made in the ordinary course of business from a banking or other financial institution), even where not illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies, from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU (e.g., seeking to do business or continuing to do business with NYU, seeking to have a student admitted to NYU) if the offer or acceptance of the gift, favor, or loan could reasonably be viewed as intended to influence NYU to act favorably toward the person or entity. Where it is impracticable for a Covered Person (or Relative) to decline a gift that would otherwise constitute a Conflict of Interest under this policy, and where it is neither illegal nor unethical for NYU itself to accept the gift, the Covered Person may accept the gift on behalf of NYU and transfer it to NYU. In such case, the Covered Person should contact the Senior Vice President for University Development and Alumni Relations to discuss the transfer of the gift to NYU or, if applicable, the University Affiliate\u2019s chief development officer. NYU Senior Administrators may not accept gifts of more than nominal value or loans from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU, even without the appearance of any intent to influence, without the consent of their supervisors.   (4) Improper Use of NYU Resources . Unauthorized use of NYU resources, including the services of University employees, for personal purposes. For example, a Covered Person may make de minimis use of NYU computers and telephone devices for personal purposes provided, however, that he or she reimburses NYU if there are additional charges to NYU from such use (e.g., a charge for an international phone call). On the other hand, a Covered Person may not use NYU students or staff to conduct personal business.   (5) Confidential Information . Obtaining, using, or disclosing NYU Confidential Information for direct or indirect personal interest, profit, or advantage; obtaining or using NYU Confidential Information for a purpose that may be detrimental to NYU; or disclosing NYU Confidential Information to a person or entity that is not authorized by NYU to receive it.   Disclosing Conflicts of Interest   Covered Persons have a duty to disclose on an ongoing basis any current, proposed, or pending situations that may constitute a Conflict of Interest, including but not limited to a proposed Related Party Transaction. Covered Persons should disclose the material facts relating to any Conflict of Interest as soon as the existence of a possible Conflict of Interest is known; and in all events, must disclose the material facts relating to any Related Party Transaction prior to entering into the transaction. There are, of course, occasional situations where a Covered Person is not aware of a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis. Where a Covered Person becomes aware that he or she has not disclosed a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis, the Covered Person has a continuing duty to disclose it as promptly as possible thereafter.    Disclosures should be made in full (including the precise nature of the Covered Person\u2019s interest and/or involvement) to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University, who will advise the Audit and Compliance Committee, normally through its Chair or another member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair.   Each year, every Covered Person must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable annual disclosure form or forms then in effect. In addition, prior to the initial election of a Trustee, such individual must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable disclosure form or forms then in effect. The General Counsel and Secretary of the University will provide a copy of all completed disclosure forms to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee.  Process Relating to Conflicts of Interest   If the General Counsel and Secretary of the University (or a lawyer in the Office of General Counsel designated by the General Counsel and Secretary of the University) and Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee (or a member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair) determine that a Covered Person has a Conflict of Interest that may need to be managed, reduced, or eliminated, the Audit and Compliance Committee will determine the next steps with respect to the Conflict of Interest. The Audit and Compliance Committee may determine that the Conflict of Interest should be managed, reduced, or eliminated, or the Audit and Compliance Committee may proceed without a management plan. Any management plan will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the specific matter. The existence and resolution of the Conflict of Interest must be documented in the records of the meeting at which it was discussed or voted upon. The Office of Compliance and Risk Management, among other resources, is available upon request to conduct investigations with respect to matters relating to Conflicts of Interest.   Any Conflict of Interest that is a Related Party Transaction must comply with the following process: A Related Party Transaction not solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative may only be entered into following approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee after the Audit and Compliance Committee has made a determination that the Related Party Transaction is fair, reasonable, and in NYU\u2019s best interest at the time of such determination. In such cases where a Related Party has a substantial financial interest, the Audit and Compliance Committee must, prior to NYU\u2019s entering into the transaction, (1) consider alternatives to the transaction to the extent available; (2) approve the transaction by not less than a majority vote of the Audit and Compliance Committee members present at the meeting; and (3) contemporaneously document in writing the basis for the Audit and Compliance Committee\u2019s approval, including its consideration of alternative transactions. With respect to a Related Party Transaction solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative, the Compensation Committee of the University normally will make the determination and undertake the process set forth above.   Depending on its nature, a matter giving rise to a Conflict of Interest, including a Related Party Transaction, may be subject to approval by the Board of Trustees and/or be subject to approval or recommendation by a committee of the Board of Trustees other than the Audit and Compliance or Compensation Committee. In such case, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee may make its approval or recommendation either before or after the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be, undertakes the process set forth above; if before, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee\u2019s approval must be subject to the determination of the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be.   In no event may a Covered Person with a Conflict of Interest be present at or participate in the deliberation or vote by the Board of Trustees, or committee thereof, on the matter giving rise to the Conflict of Interest, such as the Covered Person\u2019s compensation by the University, or attempt to influence improperly the deliberation or voting on the matter. A Covered Person may, where requested by the Board of Trustees or applicable committee, be present at the meeting prior to the commencement of deliberations or vote on the matter in order to present information or answer questions concerning the Conflict of Interest.

Even the appearance of a conflict can be damaging to the reputation of NYU. All decisions by Trustees, Officers, and Senior Administrators must be made solely in the best interests of NYU.   NYU recognizes that situations may on occasion arise where a Covered Person\u2019s private interests conflict with or appear to conflict with his or her obligations to NYU or the interests of NYU. This policy identifies and clarifies the standards and responsibilities related to Conflicts of Interest.               Scope of this Policy    This policy applies to the Trustees, Officers, and Senior Administrators of New York University (the \u201cUniversity\u201d) and of University Affiliates (together, \u201cCovered Persons\u201d). The University\u2019s Audit and Compliance Committee may exempt a University Affiliate from compliance with this policy as set forth in the \u201cUniversity Affiliates\u201d section of this policy.             Procedures for Implementation    Covered Persons must act solely to promote the best interests of NYU. Covered Persons should seek to avoid Conflicts of Interest. A \u201cConflict of Interest\u201d is any circumstance in which the personal, professional, financial, or other interests of a Covered Person may potentially or actually diverge from, or may be reasonably perceived as potentially or actually diverging from, his or her obligations to NYU and the interests of NYU. It includes indirect conflicts, such as benefits provided to a Relative of a Covered Person. Where a Conflict of Interest has been identified, a Covered Person must disclose the Conflict of Interest and, where relevant, cooperate with any plan adopted by NYU to manage, reduce, or eliminate the Conflict of Interest.   The following is not a comprehensive list of the types of Conflicts of Interest that may arise but provides examples of some common types:   (1) Business Arrangements . (a) Related Party Transactions; or (b) participating, directly or indirectly, in the selection, approval, facilitation, or administration of any business arrangement involving NYU and an enterprise in which the Covered Person and/or Relatives hold, directly or indirectly, more than a de minimis ownership or other financial interest or have an employment, management, or fiduciary role (such as serving as an officer or director). A de minimis interest for purposes of (b) is (i) an interest in diversified investment vehicles, such as broad-based mutual funds and exchange traded funds, where the Covered Person and his or her Relatives, collectively, do not have a 15 percent or greater direct or indirect interest in the vehicle or an employment, management, or fiduciary role in the vehicle; and (ii) an interest of up to five percent ownership in any class of a company\u2019s securities or other indicia of ownership provided that such ownership interest would not be reasonably expected to influence or give the appearance of influencing the actions of the Covered Person. For example, where a Covered Person has a less than five percent ownership interest in a start-up company that is seeking to license intellectual property rights from NYU that are critical to the company, such ownership might influence or give the appearance of influencing the actions of the Covered Person.   (2) Competing with NYU . Engaging, directly or indirectly, in activities that are in competition with NYU or appropriating or diverting business opportunities of NYU. This includes (a) holding, directly or indirectly, an ownership or other financial interest (other than a de minimis interest as described in (1(b) above) or having an employment, management, or fiduciary role (such as serving as an officer or director) in an enterprise that is a competitor of NYU, or seeking to advance the interests of such enterprise to the NYU community; and (b) appropriating or diverting a business or financial opportunity that a Covered Person knows or should know NYU is pursuing or is considering pursuing or reasonably might be interested in pursuing if it were aware of the opportunity.   (3) Gifts . (a) Accepting any gift or favor, even of nominal value, that is illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies; or (b) accepting a gift or favor of more than nominal value (including entertainment) or a loan (other than an arm\u2019s length loan made in the ordinary course of business from a banking or other financial institution), even where not illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies, from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU (e.g., seeking to do business or continuing to do business with NYU, seeking to have a student admitted to NYU) if the offer or acceptance of the gift, favor, or loan could reasonably be viewed as intended to influence NYU to act favorably toward the person or entity. Where it is impracticable for a Covered Person (or Relative) to decline a gift that would otherwise constitute a Conflict of Interest under this policy, and where it is neither illegal nor unethical for NYU itself to accept the gift, the Covered Person may accept the gift on behalf of NYU and transfer it to NYU. In such case, the Covered Person should contact the Senior Vice President for University Development and Alumni Relations to discuss the transfer of the gift to NYU or, if applicable, the University Affiliate\u2019s chief development officer. NYU Senior Administrators may not accept gifts of more than nominal value or loans from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU, even without the appearance of any intent to influence, without the consent of their supervisors.   (4) Improper Use of NYU Resources . Unauthorized use of NYU resources, including the services of University employees, for personal purposes. For example, a Covered Person may make de minimis use of NYU computers and telephone devices for personal purposes provided, however, that he or she reimburses NYU if there are additional charges to NYU from such use (e.g., a charge for an international phone call). On the other hand, a Covered Person may not use NYU students or staff to conduct personal business.   (5) Confidential Information . Obtaining, using, or disclosing NYU Confidential Information for direct or indirect personal interest, profit, or advantage; obtaining or using NYU Confidential Information for a purpose that may be detrimental to NYU; or disclosing NYU Confidential Information to a person or entity that is not authorized by NYU to receive it.   Disclosing Conflicts of Interest   Covered Persons have a duty to disclose on an ongoing basis any current, proposed, or pending situations that may constitute a Conflict of Interest, including but not limited to a proposed Related Party Transaction. Covered Persons should disclose the material facts relating to any Conflict of Interest as soon as the existence of a possible Conflict of Interest is known; and in all events, must disclose the material facts relating to any Related Party Transaction prior to entering into the transaction. There are, of course, occasional situations where a Covered Person is not aware of a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis. Where a Covered Person becomes aware that he or she has not disclosed a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis, the Covered Person has a continuing duty to disclose it as promptly as possible thereafter.    Disclosures should be made in full (including the precise nature of the Covered Person\u2019s interest and/or involvement) to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University, who will advise the Audit and Compliance Committee, normally through its Chair or another member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair.   Each year, every Covered Person must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable annual disclosure form or forms then in effect. In addition, prior to the initial election of a Trustee, such individual must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable disclosure form or forms then in effect. The General Counsel and Secretary of the University will provide a copy of all completed disclosure forms to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee.  Process Relating to Conflicts of Interest   If the General Counsel and Secretary of the University (or a lawyer in the Office of General Counsel designated by the General Counsel and Secretary of the University) and Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee (or a member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair) determine that a Covered Person has a Conflict of Interest that may need to be managed, reduced, or eliminated, the Audit and Compliance Committee will determine the next steps with respect to the Conflict of Interest. The Audit and Compliance Committee may determine that the Conflict of Interest should be managed, reduced, or eliminated, or the Audit and Compliance Committee may proceed without a management plan. Any management plan will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the specific matter. The existence and resolution of the Conflict of Interest must be documented in the records of the meeting at which it was discussed or voted upon. The Office of Compliance and Risk Management, among other resources, is available upon request to conduct investigations with respect to matters relating to Conflicts of Interest.   Any Conflict of Interest that is a Related Party Transaction must comply with the following process: A Related Party Transaction not solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative may only be entered into following approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee after the Audit and Compliance Committee has made a determination that the Related Party Transaction is fair, reasonable, and in NYU\u2019s best interest at the time of such determination. In such cases where a Related Party has a substantial financial interest, the Audit and Compliance Committee must, prior to NYU\u2019s entering into the transaction, (1) consider alternatives to the transaction to the extent available; (2) approve the transaction by not less than a majority vote of the Audit and Compliance Committee members present at the meeting; and (3) contemporaneously document in writing the basis for the Audit and Compliance Committee\u2019s approval, including its consideration of alternative transactions. With respect to a Related Party Transaction solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative, the Compensation Committee of the University normally will make the determination and undertake the process set forth above.   Depending on its nature, a matter giving rise to a Conflict of Interest, including a Related Party Transaction, may be subject to approval by the Board of Trustees and/or be subject to approval or recommendation by a committee of the Board of Trustees other than the Audit and Compliance or Compensation Committee. In such case, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee may make its approval or recommendation either before or after the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be, undertakes the process set forth above; if before, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee\u2019s approval must be subject to the determination of the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be.   In no event may a Covered Person with a Conflict of Interest be present at or participate in the deliberation or vote by the Board of Trustees, or committee thereof, on the matter giving rise to the Conflict of Interest, such as the Covered Person\u2019s compensation by the University, or attempt to influence improperly the deliberation or voting on the matter. A Covered Person may, where requested by the Board of Trustees or applicable committee, be present at the meeting prior to the commencement of deliberations or vote on the matter in order to present information or answer questions concerning the Conflict of Interest.

Conflict of Interest , as discussed in greater detail in Section IV and in the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects, means any circumstance in which the personal, professional, financial or other interests of an individual (including the Immediate Family Members of the individual) may potentially or actually diverge from, or may be reasonably perceived as potentially or actually diverging from, his or her professional obligations to NYU and the interests of NYU. A Conflict of Interest may exist whenever an independent observer might reasonably question whether the individual's professional actions or decisions, including the ethical and objective conduct of scholarship, research or clinical care, are determined by considerations of personal gain, financial or otherwise. A conflict of interest under the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects constitutes a Conflict of Interest under this policy.   Consulting refers to any remunerated Outside Activity involving an individual\u2019s professional competence.   Employment/Management/Fiduciary Role means a position involving service, in either a personal or representative capacity, as an employee, executive, manager, officer, director, trustee, or equivalent in a business, enterprise or entity other than NYU or an entity that is 50% or more owned or controlled by NYU.   Entity includes the entity itself and entities that own or control, are owned or controlled by or are under common ownership or control with the entity, with ownership and control defined as a 50% or greater direct or indirect interest.   Immediate Family Members include an individual\u2019s spouse or domestic partner or person in a civil union or similar relationship, dependent children, and any other family members residing in the same household.   Investigator means the principal investigator or program director, and any other person, regardless of title or position, who is responsible for the design, conduct or reporting of Research and Other Sponsored Projects, or who proposes funding for the Research and Other Sponsored Projects, at or under the auspices of NYU For purposes of this policy, other than for the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects, Investigator only includes members of the University Community. Most, but not all, Investigators are NYU faculty members.   NYU includes the Schools and other units of NYU, NYU\u2019s Global Network University sites, and all University Affiliates (as each term is defined in NYU\u2019s Policy on Policies, as amended from time to time).   Outside Activities include any external Consulting or other business activities and external professional or academic endeavors, such as public service or pro bono work, performed outside of the faculty member\u2019s appointment to NYU or an Investigator\u2019s employment or association with NYU.   Ownership Interest means holding a financial or ownership interest in a business or entity, including stock, stock option, warrant, convertible debt, partnership interest, or LLP/LLC interest, or other ownership interest or right to obtain an ownership interest. The value of an Ownership Interest is determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value where public prices are not available.   Remuneration includes salary and any payment for services not otherwise identified as salary (e.g., consulting fees, honoraria, paid editorial or authorship activities, travel reimbursement and travel paid). Honoraria paid, travel paid and travel reimbursements by a federal, state, or local government agency, or a non-profit institution of higher education, an academic teaching hospital, a medical center or a research institute, for scholarly and professional activities performed in connection with a faculty member\u2019s appointment to NYU, such as lectures or seminars, editorial or authorship activities, service on advisory committees or review panels (including professional associations), are excluded from the definition of Remuneration.   Research and Other Sponsored Projects means any research project conducted at or under the auspices of NYU, whether or not externally funded, and any externally funded training or professional service project conducted at or under the auspices of NYU.

Even the appearance of a conflict can be damaging to the reputation of NYU. All decisions by Trustees, Officers, and Senior Administrators must be made solely in the best interests of NYU.   NYU recognizes that situations may on occasion arise where a Covered Person\u2019s private interests conflict with or appear to conflict with his or her obligations to NYU or the interests of NYU. This policy identifies and clarifies the standards and responsibilities related to Conflicts of Interest.               Scope of this Policy    This policy applies to the Trustees, Officers, and Senior Administrators of New York University (the \u201cUniversity\u201d) and of University Affiliates (together, \u201cCovered Persons\u201d). The University\u2019s Audit and Compliance Committee may exempt a University Affiliate from compliance with this policy as set forth in the \u201cUniversity Affiliates\u201d section of this policy.             Procedures for Implementation    Covered Persons must act solely to promote the best interests of NYU. Covered Persons should seek to avoid Conflicts of Interest. A \u201cConflict of Interest\u201d is any circumstance in which the personal, professional, financial, or other interests of a Covered Person may potentially or actually diverge from, or may be reasonably perceived as potentially or actually diverging from, his or her obligations to NYU and the interests of NYU. It includes indirect conflicts, such as benefits provided to a Relative of a Covered Person. Where a Conflict of Interest has been identified, a Covered Person must disclose the Conflict of Interest and, where relevant, cooperate with any plan adopted by NYU to manage, reduce, or eliminate the Conflict of Interest.   The following is not a comprehensive list of the types of Conflicts of Interest that may arise but provides examples of some common types:   (1) Business Arrangements . (a) Related Party Transactions; or (b) participating, directly or indirectly, in the selection, approval, facilitation, or administration of any business arrangement involving NYU and an enterprise in which the Covered Person and/or Relatives hold, directly or indirectly, more than a de minimis ownership or other financial interest or have an employment, management, or fiduciary role (such as serving as an officer or director). A de minimis interest for purposes of (b) is (i) an interest in diversified investment vehicles, such as broad-based mutual funds and exchange traded funds, where the Covered Person and his or her Relatives, collectively, do not have a 15 percent or greater direct or indirect interest in the vehicle or an employment, management, or fiduciary role in the vehicle; and (ii) an interest of up to five percent ownership in any class of a company\u2019s securities or other indicia of ownership provided that such ownership interest would not be reasonably expected to influence or give the appearance of influencing the actions of the Covered Person. For example, where a Covered Person has a less than five percent ownership interest in a start-up company that is seeking to license intellectual property rights from NYU that are critical to the company, such ownership might influence or give the appearance of influencing the actions of the Covered Person.   (2) Competing with NYU . Engaging, directly or indirectly, in activities that are in competition with NYU or appropriating or diverting business opportunities of NYU. This includes (a) holding, directly or indirectly, an ownership or other financial interest (other than a de minimis interest as described in (1(b) above) or having an employment, management, or fiduciary role (such as serving as an officer or director) in an enterprise that is a competitor of NYU, or seeking to advance the interests of such enterprise to the NYU community; and (b) appropriating or diverting a business or financial opportunity that a Covered Person knows or should know NYU is pursuing or is considering pursuing or reasonably might be interested in pursuing if it were aware of the opportunity.   (3) Gifts . (a) Accepting any gift or favor, even of nominal value, that is illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies; or (b) accepting a gift or favor of more than nominal value (including entertainment) or a loan (other than an arm\u2019s length loan made in the ordinary course of business from a banking or other financial institution), even where not illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies, from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU (e.g., seeking to do business or continuing to do business with NYU, seeking to have a student admitted to NYU) if the offer or acceptance of the gift, favor, or loan could reasonably be viewed as intended to influence NYU to act favorably toward the person or entity. Where it is impracticable for a Covered Person (or Relative) to decline a gift that would otherwise constitute a Conflict of Interest under this policy, and where it is neither illegal nor unethical for NYU itself to accept the gift, the Covered Person may accept the gift on behalf of NYU and transfer it to NYU. In such case, the Covered Person should contact the Senior Vice President for University Development and Alumni Relations to discuss the transfer of the gift to NYU or, if applicable, the University Affiliate\u2019s chief development officer. NYU Senior Administrators may not accept gifts of more than nominal value or loans from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU, even without the appearance of any intent to influence, without the consent of their supervisors.   (4) Improper Use of NYU Resources . Unauthorized use of NYU resources, including the services of University employees, for personal purposes. For example, a Covered Person may make de minimis use of NYU computers and telephone devices for personal purposes provided, however, that he or she reimburses NYU if there are additional charges to NYU from such use (e.g., a charge for an international phone call). On the other hand, a Covered Person may not use NYU students or staff to conduct personal business.   (5) Confidential Information . Obtaining, using, or disclosing NYU Confidential Information for direct or indirect personal interest, profit, or advantage; obtaining or using NYU Confidential Information for a purpose that may be detrimental to NYU; or disclosing NYU Confidential Information to a person or entity that is not authorized by NYU to receive it.   Disclosing Conflicts of Interest   Covered Persons have a duty to disclose on an ongoing basis any current, proposed, or pending situations that may constitute a Conflict of Interest, including but not limited to a proposed Related Party Transaction. Covered Persons should disclose the material facts relating to any Conflict of Interest as soon as the existence of a possible Conflict of Interest is known; and in all events, must disclose the material facts relating to any Related Party Transaction prior to entering into the transaction. There are, of course, occasional situations where a Covered Person is not aware of a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis. Where a Covered Person becomes aware that he or she has not disclosed a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis, the Covered Person has a continuing duty to disclose it as promptly as possible thereafter.    Disclosures should be made in full (including the precise nature of the Covered Person\u2019s interest and/or involvement) to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University, who will advise the Audit and Compliance Committee, normally through its Chair or another member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair.   Each year, every Covered Person must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable annual disclosure form or forms then in effect. In addition, prior to the initial election of a Trustee, such individual must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable disclosure form or forms then in effect. The General Counsel and Secretary of the University will provide a copy of all completed disclosure forms to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee.  Process Relating to Conflicts of Interest   If the General Counsel and Secretary of the University (or a lawyer in the Office of General Counsel designated by the General Counsel and Secretary of the University) and Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee (or a member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair) determine that a Covered Person has a Conflict of Interest that may need to be managed, reduced, or eliminated, the Audit and Compliance Committee will determine the next steps with respect to the Conflict of Interest. The Audit and Compliance Committee may determine that the Conflict of Interest should be managed, reduced, or eliminated, or the Audit and Compliance Committee may proceed without a management plan. Any management plan will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the specific matter. The existence and resolution of the Conflict of Interest must be documented in the records of the meeting at which it was discussed or voted upon. The Office of Compliance and Risk Management, among other resources, is available upon request to conduct investigations with respect to matters relating to Conflicts of Interest.   Any Conflict of Interest that is a Related Party Transaction must comply with the following process: A Related Party Transaction not solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative may only be entered into following approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee after the Audit and Compliance Committee has made a determination that the Related Party Transaction is fair, reasonable, and in NYU\u2019s best interest at the time of such determination. In such cases where a Related Party has a substantial financial interest, the Audit and Compliance Committee must, prior to NYU\u2019s entering into the transaction, (1) consider alternatives to the transaction to the extent available; (2) approve the transaction by not less than a majority vote of the Audit and Compliance Committee members present at the meeting; and (3) contemporaneously document in writing the basis for the Audit and Compliance Committee\u2019s approval, including its consideration of alternative transactions. With respect to a Related Party Transaction solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative, the Compensation Committee of the University normally will make the determination and undertake the process set forth above.   Depending on its nature, a matter giving rise to a Conflict of Interest, including a Related Party Transaction, may be subject to approval by the Board of Trustees and/or be subject to approval or recommendation by a committee of the Board of Trustees other than the Audit and Compliance or Compensation Committee. In such case, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee may make its approval or recommendation either before or after the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be, undertakes the process set forth above; if before, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee\u2019s approval must be subject to the determination of the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be.   In no event may a Covered Person with a Conflict of Interest be present at or participate in the deliberation or vote by the Board of Trustees, or committee thereof, on the matter giving rise to the Conflict of Interest, such as the Covered Person\u2019s compensation by the University, or attempt to influence improperly the deliberation or voting on the matter.

Even the appearance of a conflict can be damaging to the reputation of NYU. All decisions by Trustees, Officers, and Senior Administrators must be made solely in the best interests of NYU.   NYU recognizes that situations may on occasion arise where a Covered Person\u2019s private interests conflict with or appear to conflict with his or her obligations to NYU or the interests of NYU. This policy identifies and clarifies the standards and responsibilities related to Conflicts of Interest.               Scope of this Policy    This policy applies to the Trustees, Officers, and Senior Administrators of New York University (the \u201cUniversity\u201d) and of University Affiliates (together, \u201cCovered Persons\u201d). The University\u2019s Audit and Compliance Committee may exempt a University Affiliate from compliance with this policy as set forth in the \u201cUniversity Affiliates\u201d section of this policy.             Procedures for Implementation    Covered Persons must act solely to promote the best interests of NYU. Covered Persons should seek to avoid Conflicts of Interest. A \u201cConflict of Interest\u201d is any circumstance in which the personal, professional, financial, or other interests of a Covered Person may potentially or actually diverge from, or may be reasonably perceived as potentially or actually diverging from, his or her obligations to NYU and the interests of NYU. It includes indirect conflicts, such as benefits provided to a Relative of a Covered Person. Where a Conflict of Interest has been identified, a Covered Person must disclose the Conflict of Interest and, where relevant, cooperate with any plan adopted by NYU to manage, reduce, or eliminate the Conflict of Interest.   The following is not a comprehensive list of the types of Conflicts of Interest that may arise but provides examples of some common types:   (1) Business Arrangements . (a) Related Party Transactions; or (b) participating, directly or indirectly, in the selection, approval, facilitation, or administration of any business arrangement involving NYU and an enterprise in which the Covered Person and/or Relatives hold, directly or indirectly, more than a de minimis ownership or other financial interest or have an employment, management, or fiduciary role (such as serving as an officer or director). A de minimis interest for purposes of (b) is (i) an interest in diversified investment vehicles, such as broad-based mutual funds and exchange traded funds, where the Covered Person and his or her Relatives, collectively, do not have a 15 percent or greater direct or indirect interest in the vehicle or an employment, management, or fiduciary role in the vehicle; and (ii) an interest of up to five percent ownership in any class of a company\u2019s securities or other indicia of ownership provided that such ownership interest would not be reasonably expected to influence or give the appearance of influencing the actions of the Covered Person. For example, where a Covered Person has a less than five percent ownership interest in a start-up company that is seeking to license intellectual property rights from NYU that are critical to the company, such ownership might influence or give the appearance of influencing the actions of the Covered Person.   (2) Competing with NYU . Engaging, directly or indirectly, in activities that are in competition with NYU or appropriating or diverting business opportunities of NYU. This includes (a) holding, directly or indirectly, an ownership or other financial interest (other than a de minimis interest as described in (1(b) above) or having an employment, management, or fiduciary role (such as serving as an officer or director) in an enterprise that is a competitor of NYU, or seeking to advance the interests of such enterprise to the NYU community; and (b) appropriating or diverting a business or financial opportunity that a Covered Person knows or should know NYU is pursuing or is considering pursuing or reasonably might be interested in pursuing if it were aware of the opportunity.   (3) Gifts . (a) Accepting any gift or favor, even of nominal value, that is illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies; or (b) accepting a gift or favor of more than nominal value (including entertainment) or a loan (other than an arm\u2019s length loan made in the ordinary course of business from a banking or other financial institution), even where not illegal under applicable law or prohibited under other applicable NYU policies, from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU (e.g., seeking to do business or continuing to do business with NYU, seeking to have a student admitted to NYU) if the offer or acceptance of the gift, favor, or loan could reasonably be viewed as intended to influence NYU to act favorably toward the person or entity. Where it is impracticable for a Covered Person (or Relative) to decline a gift that would otherwise constitute a Conflict of Interest under this policy, and where it is neither illegal nor unethical for NYU itself to accept the gift, the Covered Person may accept the gift on behalf of NYU and transfer it to NYU. In such case, the Covered Person should contact the Senior Vice President for University Development and Alumni Relations to discuss the transfer of the gift to NYU or, if applicable, the University Affiliate\u2019s chief development officer. NYU Senior Administrators may not accept gifts of more than nominal value or loans from any person or entity seeking a benefit from NYU, even without the appearance of any intent to influence, without the consent of their supervisors.   (4) Improper Use of NYU Resources . Unauthorized use of NYU resources, including the services of University employees, for personal purposes. For example, a Covered Person may make de minimis use of NYU computers and telephone devices for personal purposes provided, however, that he or she reimburses NYU if there are additional charges to NYU from such use (e.g., a charge for an international phone call). On the other hand, a Covered Person may not use NYU students or staff to conduct personal business.   (5) Confidential Information . Obtaining, using, or disclosing NYU Confidential Information for direct or indirect personal interest, profit, or advantage; obtaining or using NYU Confidential Information for a purpose that may be detrimental to NYU; or disclosing NYU Confidential Information to a person or entity that is not authorized by NYU to receive it.   Disclosing Conflicts of Interest   Covered Persons have a duty to disclose on an ongoing basis any current, proposed, or pending situations that may constitute a Conflict of Interest, including but not limited to a proposed Related Party Transaction. Covered Persons should disclose the material facts relating to any Conflict of Interest as soon as the existence of a possible Conflict of Interest is known; and in all events, must disclose the material facts relating to any Related Party Transaction prior to entering into the transaction. There are, of course, occasional situations where a Covered Person is not aware of a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis. Where a Covered Person becomes aware that he or she has not disclosed a Conflict of Interest on a timely basis, the Covered Person has a continuing duty to disclose it as promptly as possible thereafter.    Disclosures should be made in full (including the precise nature of the Covered Person\u2019s interest and/or involvement) to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University, who will advise the Audit and Compliance Committee, normally through its Chair or another member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair.   Each year, every Covered Person must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable annual disclosure form or forms then in effect. In addition, prior to the initial election of a Trustee, such individual must complete, sign, and submit to the General Counsel and Secretary of the University the applicable disclosure form or forms then in effect. The General Counsel and Secretary of the University will provide a copy of all completed disclosure forms to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee.  Process Relating to Conflicts of Interest   If the General Counsel and Secretary of the University (or a lawyer in the Office of General Counsel designated by the General Counsel and Secretary of the University) and Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee (or a member of the Audit and Compliance Committee designated by the Chair) determine that a Covered Person has a Conflict of Interest that may need to be managed, reduced, or eliminated, the Audit and Compliance Committee will determine the next steps with respect to the Conflict of Interest. The Audit and Compliance Committee may determine that the Conflict of Interest should be managed, reduced, or eliminated, or the Audit and Compliance Committee may proceed without a management plan. Any management plan will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the specific matter. The existence and resolution of the Conflict of Interest must be documented in the records of the meeting at which it was discussed or voted upon. The Office of Compliance and Risk Management, among other resources, is available upon request to conduct investigations with respect to matters relating to Conflicts of Interest.   Any Conflict of Interest that is a Related Party Transaction must comply with the following process: A Related Party Transaction not solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative may only be entered into following approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee after the Audit and Compliance Committee has made a determination that the Related Party Transaction is fair, reasonable, and in NYU\u2019s best interest at the time of such determination. In such cases where a Related Party has a substantial financial interest, the Audit and Compliance Committee must, prior to NYU\u2019s entering into the transaction, (1) consider alternatives to the transaction to the extent available; (2) approve the transaction by not less than a majority vote of the Audit and Compliance Committee members present at the meeting; and (3) contemporaneously document in writing the basis for the Audit and Compliance Committee\u2019s approval, including its consideration of alternative transactions. With respect to a Related Party Transaction solely involving compensation and/or benefits paid to a Covered Person or Relative, the Compensation Committee of the University normally will make the determination and undertake the process set forth above.   Depending on its nature, a matter giving rise to a Conflict of Interest, including a Related Party Transaction, may be subject to approval by the Board of Trustees and/or be subject to approval or recommendation by a committee of the Board of Trustees other than the Audit and Compliance or Compensation Committee. In such case, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee may make its approval or recommendation either before or after the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be, undertakes the process set forth above; if before, the Board of Trustees or applicable committee\u2019s approval must be subject to the determination of the Audit and Compliance Committee or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be.   In no event may a Covered Person with a Conflict of Interest be present at or participate in the deliberation or vote by the Board of Trustees, or committee thereof, on the matter giving rise to the Conflict of Interest, such as the Covered Person\u2019s compensation by the University, or attempt to influence improperly the deliberation or voting on the matter. A Covered Person may, where requested by the Board of Trustees or applicable committee, be present at the meeting prior to the commencement of deliberations or vote on the matter in order to present information or answer questions concerning the Conflict of Interest.

Conflict of Interest , as discussed in greater detail in Section IV and in the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects, means any circumstance in which the personal, professional, financial or other interests of an individual (including the Immediate Family Members of the individual) may potentially or actually diverge from, or may be reasonably perceived as potentially or actually diverging from, his or her professional obligations to NYU and the interests of NYU. A Conflict of Interest may exist whenever an independent observer might reasonably question whether the individual's professional actions or decisions, including the ethical and objective conduct of scholarship, research or clinical care, are determined by considerations of personal gain, financial or otherwise. A conflict of interest under the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects constitutes a Conflict of Interest under this policy.   Consulting refers to any remunerated Outside Activity involving an individual\u2019s professional competence.   Employment/Management/Fiduciary Role means a position involving service, in either a personal or representative capacity, as an employee, executive, manager, officer, director, trustee, or equivalent in a business, enterprise or entity other than NYU or an entity that is 50% or more owned or controlled by NYU.   Entity includes the entity itself and entities that own or control, are owned or controlled by or are under common ownership or control with the entity, with ownership and control defined as a 50% or greater direct or indirect interest.   Immediate Family Members include an individual\u2019s spouse or domestic partner or person in a civil union or similar relationship, dependent children, and any other family members residing in the same household.   Investigator means the principal investigator or program director, and any other person, regardless of title or position, who is responsible for the design, conduct or reporting of Research and Other Sponsored Projects, or who proposes funding for the Research and Other Sponsored Projects, at or under the auspices of NYU For purposes of this policy, other than for the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects, Investigator only includes members of the University Community. Most, but not all, Investigators are NYU faculty members.   NYU includes the Schools and other units of NYU, NYU\u2019s Global Network University sites, and all University Affiliates (as each term is defined in NYU\u2019s Policy on Policies, as amended from time to time).   Outside Activities include any external Consulting or other business activities and external professional or academic endeavors, such as public service or pro bono work, performed outside of the faculty member\u2019s appointment to NYU or an Investigator\u2019s employment or association with NYU.   Ownership Interest means holding a financial or ownership interest in a business or entity, including stock, stock option, warrant, convertible debt, partnership interest, or LLP/LLC interest, or other ownership interest or right to obtain an ownership interest. The value of an Ownership Interest is determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value where public prices are not available.   Remuneration includes salary and any payment for services not otherwise identified as salary (e.g., consulting fees, honoraria, paid editorial or authorship activities, travel reimbursement and travel paid). Honoraria paid, travel paid and travel reimbursements by a federal, state, or local government agency, or a non-profit institution of higher education, an academic teaching hospital, a medical center or a research institute, for scholarly and professional activities performed in connection with a faculty member\u2019s appointment to NYU, such as lectures or seminars, editorial or authorship activities, service on advisory committees or review panels (including professional associations), are excluded from the definition of Remuneration.   Research and Other Sponsored Projects means any research project conducted at or under the auspices of NYU, whether or not externally funded, and any externally funded training or professional service project conducted at or under the auspices of NYU. Research and Other Sponsored Projects includes any systematic investigation, study or experiment designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, including basic and applied research (e.g., a published article, book or book chapter) and product development (e.g., a diagnostic test, drug or device), and non-research projects such as training, clinical services, educational conferences, exhibitions, performances, archives, workshops, and library projects for which external funding is received. Research and Other Sponsored Projects includes any such activity for which funding is available from external sources through a grant, contract or agreement, including, but not limited to, research grants, career development awards, center grants, individual fellowship awards, infrastructure awards, institutional training grants, program projects and research resources awards.   School means each NYU school, college and institute that functions similarly to a school or college (such as IFA, ISAW, Courant and CUSP), each NYU comprehensive campus (such as New York and Abu Dhabi) and also may include for purposes of this policy other global sites as designated by the Provost.   School Dean means the dean, or his or her designee, of each NYU school and college, the director or each NYU institute that functions similarly to a school or college (such as IFA, ISAW, Courant and CUSP) and the Vice Chancellor of each NYU comprehensive campus (such as New York and Abu Dhabi). In the case of other NYU global sites that have faculty and/or Investigators, the Provost may designate someone to fulfill some or all of the duties of a School Dean as described herein with respect to such global sites.   University Community means NYU faculty, including visiting faculty; researchers, including persons participating in research at or under the auspices of NYU; employees; professional staff, including medical, dental and nursing staff; volunteers; fellows, trainees and post-doctoral appointees; students; and consultants, vendors and contractors.
