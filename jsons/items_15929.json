Islam, the Arabian Peninsula\u2014today comprising the countries Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait\u2014is the origin of music that is much less known than that of more populous countries of Arabic speech. This workshop represents a rare opportunity to bring together senior and younger scholars in order to pose fundamental questions about what is already known, and what kinds of information would be needed to identify key issues in the musical life of today and of the recent past.

Islam, the Arabian Peninsula\u2014today comprising the countries Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait\u2014is the origin of music that is much less known than that of more populous countries of Arabic speech. This workshop represents a rare opportunity to bring together senior and younger scholars in order to pose fundamental questions about what is already known, and what kinds of information would be needed to identify key issues in the musical life of today and of the recent past.

Arabian Peninsula, at the crossroads of the three continents of the Eastern hemisphere: Africa, Asia, and Europe. The historical, sociopolitical, and cultural interactions among these regions have opened engaging domains of study in both the humanities and social sciences. The flow of people, ideas, and commodities through the Gulf has made it a cosmopolitan and culturally hybrid setting for many centuries. The historical archives testify to this richness, which can also be gleaned from the artistic, architectural and musical developments, the variety of spoken languages, and the diversity of people who now live in the Gulf region.     Abu Dhabi is located in one of the most important regions in the world. The Arabian Peninsula is home to Islam\u2019s holiest sites, and contains at least sixty percent of the world\u2019s proven fossil fuel reserves. Having experienced foreign domination and experiencing political upheaval, Arab nations are evolving extremely rapidly. Abu Dhabi is a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Arab Crossroads Studies program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.                                 Multidisciplinary Curriculum     History and Religion , which includes a broad and solid grounding in the pre-modern and modern social, cultural, religious and economic landscapes of the region. These courses focus on primary source documents to introduce students to the rich and varied history of the region as well as to the doctrinal and social aspects of the religious traditions that have shaped it.     Society and Politics , which includes a detailed and nuanced examination of the contemporary landscape of the region. These courses draw on anthropology, ethnography, political science, and sociology to elucidate the complex cultural, social, and political developments taking place today.     Arts and Literature , which includes a careful study of the literary, artistic, and philosophical landscapes of the region. These courses explore the literatures, arts, and physical environments of the region within their broader historical and social contexts.

Islam, the Arabian Peninsula\u2014today comprising the countries Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait\u2014is the origin of music that is much less known than that of more populous countries of Arabic speech. This workshop represents a rare opportunity to bring together senior and younger scholars in order to pose fundamental questions about what is already known, and what kinds of information would be needed to identify key issues in the musical life of today and of the recent past.

Arabian Peninsula, at the crossroads of the three continents of the Eastern hemisphere: Africa, Asia, and Europe. The historical, sociopolitical, and cultural interactions among these regions have opened engaging domains of study in both the humanities and social sciences. The flow of people, ideas, and commodities through the Gulf has made it a cosmopolitan and culturally hybrid setting for many centuries. The historical archives testify to this richness, which can also be gleaned from the artistic, architectural and musical developments, the variety of spoken languages, and the diversity of people who now live in the Gulf region.     Abu Dhabi is located in one of the most important regions in the world. The Arabian Peninsula is home to Islam\u2019s holiest sites, and contains at least sixty percent of the world\u2019s proven fossil fuel reserves. Having experienced foreign domination and experiencing political upheaval, Arab nations are evolving extremely rapidly. Abu Dhabi is a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Arab Crossroads Studies program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.                                 Multidisciplinary Curriculum     History and Religion , which includes a broad and solid grounding in the pre-modern and modern social, cultural, religious and economic landscapes of the region. These courses focus on primary source documents to introduce students to the rich and varied history of the region as well as to the doctrinal and social aspects of the religious traditions that have shaped it.     Society and Politics , which includes a detailed and nuanced examination of the contemporary landscape of the region. These courses draw on anthropology, ethnography, political science, and sociology to elucidate the complex cultural, social, and political developments taking place today.     Arts and Literature , which includes a careful study of the literary, artistic, and philosophical landscapes of the region. These courses explore the literatures, arts, and physical environments of the region within their broader historical and social contexts.
