Course Level: Intermediate  4 points.  No prerequisite.    Over the last 50 years the American Cinema has produced a remarkably rich abundance of entertaining, exciting, and challenging films. This course is designed to provide a survey of the wealth of styles, forms, purposes, and approaches to filmmaking that developed and emerged in this era. While Hollywood has obviously served as the dominant mode of filmmaking in this country, a significant diversity of other filmmaking practices have continued to operate and sometimes thrive outside of it. Beyond the attention paid to Hollywood narrative cinema as it has changed and evolved over this half-century, we will also consider documentaries, avant-garde and experimental works, independent narrative cinema, and \u201ccult\u201d films. Consequentially, we will be screening a variety of films, including works by such notable American filmmakers as Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Quentin Tarantino, George Romero, John Singleton, and Michael Moore.

Course Level: Intermediate 4 points.  No prerequisite.                                         This course offers a broad survey of American cinema from its beginnings (and even its history) up to 1960. While the emphasis will be on the dominant, narrative fiction film, there will be attention to other modes of American cinema such as experimental film, animation, shorts, and non-fiction film. The course will look closely at films themselves -- how do their styles and narrative structures change over time? -- but also at contexts: how do films reflect their times? how does the film industry develop? what are the key institutions that had impact on American film over its history? We will also attend to the role of key figures in film's history: from creative personnel (for example, the director or the screenwriter) to industrialists and administrators, to censors to critics and to audiences themselves. The goal will be to provide an overall understanding of one of the most consequential of modern popular art forms and of its particular contributions to the art and culture of our modernity.

In a two-day event open to the general public, the symposium interrogates the current trends of study, research, and production of film and media from Latin America. With screenings, academic panels, and roundtables with programmers and filmmakers, the symposium is an opportunity to share research and information, to engage in collaborative efforts among institutions, and to encourage an open discussion on critical topics and issues in contemporary Latin American cinema, as well as on its history and trajectory. Central to the meeting is an interest to discuss how Latin American cinema can become more visible in Cinema Studies programs in a geographical area rich in public screenings, premieres, and fora on Latin American cinema.
