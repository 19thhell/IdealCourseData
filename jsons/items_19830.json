Automatic Control work began at Poly began in the 1950&rsquo;s as an offshoot from electrical circuit design. Isaac Horowitz spent 1951-58 as a student, teacher and professor at Poly, where he earned his PhD. He later did outstanding work in aircraft guidance and control and was a prolific writer and consultant.    John Truxal &rsquo;s seminal book Automatic Feedback Control System Synthesis, published in 1955, attracted faculty and students to the growing field. He became Professor and Head of the EE Department in 1957 and was active in the formation of the American Automatic Control Conference. His work with the Systems and Control Group of Poly&rsquo;s Microwave Research Institute on Adaptive Control Systems lead to a symposium on that subject with a Proceedings and the book Adaptive Control Systems, edited by Mishkin and Braun, published in 1961. He was a fellow of National Academy of Engineering.    Truxal&rsquo;s students who later became Poly faculty included Peter Dorato (finite time stability; robust control), Richard A. Haddad (signal processing), Martin L. Shooman (software engineering), and Joseph J. Bongiorno, Jr. (frequency domain optimization of multivariable control systems)    Dante C. Youla used his circuit synthesis expertise to develop ground-breaking solutions for optimization of linear, multivariable control systems. He joined Poly in 1955. Prof. Youla is a member of National Academy of Engineering and has been the recipient of many awards.    Faculty who joined the department in the 60&rsquo;s included Leonard Shaw (stochastic systems), Rudolph F. Drenick (system modeling and optimization), and for five years, Alexander Levis (architecture for system design). Drenick and Shaw each served terms as Department Head.    John Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at New York University.    Philip Sarachik (linear systems) joined the department when the New York University engineering school joined Poly in 1973.    Bernard Friedland joined the department as an adjunct professor in 1970&#39;s till 1990.    Stephen Kahne, who was active in and served as president of both the IEEE Control Systems Society and the International Federation of Automatic Control, was Dean of Engineering at Poly in the 1980&rsquo;s. During that same period Janos Gertler (fault detection) was on the EE faculty.    Farshad Khorrami (controls and robotics) joined the ECE faculty in 1988 and has established the control/robotics research laboratory (CRRL) at Poly. He also established a controls program for the ME Dept. by bringing in Anthony Tzes (controls and system identification) as an ME faculty. Thereafter, Zigang Pan (game theory and controls) was with the ECE Dept. for two years starting in 1996. Zhong-Ping Jiang (systems and nonlinear control) joined the ECE faculty in 1999.

Fortunately, the vast majority of research and teaching activity at NYU falls within one or more of the following exemptions to the EAR and ITAR regulations:      The fundamental research exclusion exempts from coverage basic and applied research in science and engineering performed by institutions of higher learning in the U.S. as long as the research is carried out openly and without restrictions on publication or access to or dissemination of the research results.    The education exclusion exempts from export controls the sharing of information commonly taught in colleges and universities (ITAR) or educational information released by instruction in catalog courses and associated teaching laboratories (EAR). Therefore, in general, no license is required to share information as part of a course being taught. Note, however, that the education exclusion does not apply to proprietary information and certain information deemed classified or sensitive by the federal government.    The public domain exclusion exempts the sharing of technical data or information with a foreign national inside the U.S. as part of a class, laboratory, or conference or seminar, if the same technical data or information has already been widely published or is available in libraries or through newsstands, bookstores, subscriptions or free web sites or is disclosed in published patent applications.      Most items and information a university researcher wants to physically export outside the U.S. will not have a \"dual use\" or military application and should therefore, fall under a broad exception to the licensing requirement. However, if the item or information involves one or more of the following general categories, check the Export Administration Regulations Database and consult with Paul Horn, Senior Vice Provost for Research for assistance in determining if a license might be necessary:      nuclear materials, information and equipment;    chemicals, micoorganisms or biotoxins (see list) which could be used for terrorist purposes;    materials processing (anti-friction bearings, crucibles made of materials resistant to liquid actinide metals, valve bearings, generators and equipment related to nuclear material handling, piping, fittings and valves, explosives or detonators, chemical vapor deposition furnaces, robots, etc.);    electronics development (certain components, including microprocessor microcircuits, wave pulse discharge capacitors, wave tube amplifiers, etc.);    computers (generally, CTPs bigger than 190,000MTOPs), encryption software, telecommunications and information security;    lasers and sensors (certain marine acoustic systems, mono- or multispectral imaging sensors designed for remote sensing, specified direct view imaging equipment, certain cameras with specified frames, readout and pixels, etc.);    navigation and avionics; marine items; and    propulsion systems, space vehicles and related equipment.      Further, no license is generally required to travel to, conduct research in and take equipment to, most foreign countries as part of your teaching and/or research responsibilities. However, OFAC restrictions apply to a limited number of embargoed entities and specially designated nationals. OFAC restrictions limit certain activities in the Balkans, Burma, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe. Check for updates to the embargoed entities and the specific limitations for each country at: http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs . In addition, OFAC programs prohibit the provision of services to countries subject to US sanctions, boycotts, etc. without a license. Such services include: conducting surveys or interviews in, or transmitting on-line courses to, a boycotted country. Excluding countries under sanction, faculty who wish to take their laptops out of the country to use in a project that qualifies as fundamental research may be able to do so under the license exception for temporary export if the laptop meets the requirement for \u201ctools of trade\u201d and faculty retain control of the laptop at all times.
