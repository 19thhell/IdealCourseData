Although chemists have successfully synthesized polymers with a wide variety of functional groups, they have not attained the sequence-specificity and monodispersity of proteins and nucleic acids. Conversely, protein chemists have been constrained by the lack of chemical diversity in the set of monomers specified by the genetic code. Research in my group seeks to overcome these obstacles. We are creating new classes of macromolecules that integrate the desirable characteristics of biopolymers and synthetic polymers. We are pursuing two complementary strategies: the chemical synthesis of biomimetic sequence-specific heteropolymers, and the biosynthesis of proteins incorporating abiotic amino acids. Our goals are to find new avenues for the study of self-organization in macromolecules and to create innovative research tools for structural biology, biophysics, proteomics and materials science.             Macromolecular Design: integrating the desirable properties of biopolymers &amp; synthetic polymers              New structures and functions in biomimetic heteropolymers. Recent studies have shown that some synthetic heteropolymer systems can mimic biopolymers by forming well-ordered structures. For example, certain sequences of N-substituted glycine oligomers, or peptoids, have a remarkable propensity for stable helical secondary structures. Peptoids are similar to biological polypeptides, but the side chains are repositioned to be pendant groups of the mainchain nitrogen atoms. A highly efficient solid-phase synthesis protocol enables the generation of sequence-specific polypeptoids that include chemically diverse side chains. We seek to elaborate and utilize secondary structures formed by this class of peptidomimetics, and identify sequences capable of recognizing biomolecular targets. We are also initiating efforts to assemble peptoid secondary structure motifs to attain mimics of protein tertiary structures.    Enhancing the chemical diversity of proteins. The biological protein synthetic apparatus can be manipulated to utilize amino acid analogs containing abiotic chemical functionalities. This approach can provide proteins with tailored physico-chemical properties and can enable new routes in bioconjugate chemistry. Our lab is developing improved methods for efficient incorporation of amino acid analogs so that they may be used as tools to study the structure, dynamics, and interactions of proteins. Ultimately, we seek to move beyond merely expanding the diversity of protein sidechains by investigating the ribosomal-mediated synthesis of proteins incorporating non-natural backbone elements.
