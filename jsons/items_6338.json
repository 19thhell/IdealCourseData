No more than 18 students are permitted in each seminar.     Recent first-year interdisciplinary seminars have included \u201cCapitalism and Democracy,\u201d \u201cThe Social Construction of Reality,\u201d and \u201cThe Thingliness of Things.\u201d       In addition, students take two thematic writing seminars, one each semester, with no more than 15 students in each class.     Recent writing seminars have included \u201cThe Idea of America: What Does it Mean?,&quot; \u201cImagining Cities,\u201d \u201cFood Culture and Food Writing,\u201d and \u201cMyths and Fables in Popular Culture.\u201d         First-year students are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in departments and schools throughout NYU in the fields of study in which they may choose to concentrate.               Sophomore Year     During the sophomore year, students begin to define their concentration. Sophomores often take at least one Gallatin interdisciplinary seminar, and many select a sophomore-only interdisciplinary seminar.     Recent sophomore-only seminars include\u201cAmerican Narratives I,\u201d \u201cLiterary and Critical Theory,\u201d and \u201cShakespeare's Mediterranean.\u201d         At the end of the sophomore year, each student writes the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration, a short essay that is read and approved by his or her faculty adviser. This plan details the steps the student will take towards defining his or her concentration.   Sophomores are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in the other schools of NYU, and many also choose to study abroad for a semester.   Sophomores often undertake internships related to their fields of study in various businesses, cultural institutions, and nonprofit organizations throughout New York City.   Sophomores may also choose to pursue their work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.           Junior Year          Juniors often take several Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars.    In the junior year, students continue to deepen their knowledge in their chosen fields of study by taking courses widely in other departments and schools at NYU.    During the junior year, students begin preparing for their senior colloquium by taking the course, \u201cThird-Year Symposium,\u201d which guides them through the process of writing the rationale, a short essay with booklist that defines the focus of their colloquium. The rationale is read and approved by two faculty members.    Juniors often undertake internships related to their fields of study and may do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.    Juniors may also take advantage of study abroad options, perhaps for one semester or even for one year. Particularly popular study abroad options for Gallatin students are NYU in Prague, NYU in Ghana, and Gallatin-specific summer courses in Florence, Berlin, and Buenos Aires.               Senior Year     In the fall of their senior year, students finalize plans for their senior colloquium, a two-hour oral exam and conversation involving three faculty members. At the colloquium, students present a variety of texts that have proved important in their concentration. These texts are selected to represent a range of knowledge, touching on topics both ancient and modern. The colloquium is that capstone event of a Gallatin education.     Students continue taking Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars in their senior year and also take advanced courses throughout the University in their fields of focus.   In the second semester of the senior year, students have the option to undertake a senior project or senior essay.   Seniors undertake internships related to their fields of study and may continue to do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.                      top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

This course begins with the premise that &quot;the real&quot; is something we construct. We create reality through the stories we tell and the stories told to us. Since the most powerful storytellers today are the commercial media, we will pay special attention to the role of entertainment, advertising, and public relations in constructing our reality. Texts for the course include works by Plato, Rene Descartes, W.E.B. Du Bois, Maxine Hong Kingston, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Herman Melville, Walter Lippmann, Jean Baudrillard, Slavoj Zizek, Judith Butler, Jonathan Lear and John Berger.

No more than 18 students are permitted in each seminar.     Recent first-year interdisciplinary seminars have included \u201cCapitalism and Democracy,\u201d \u201cThe Social Construction of Reality,\u201d and \u201cThe Thingliness of Things.\u201d       In addition, students take two thematic writing seminars, one each semester, with no more than 15 students in each class.     Recent writing seminars have included \u201cThe Idea of America: What Does it Mean?,&quot; \u201cImagining Cities,\u201d \u201cFood Culture and Food Writing,\u201d and \u201cMyths and Fables in Popular Culture.\u201d         First-year students are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in departments and schools throughout NYU in the fields of study in which they may choose to concentrate.               Sophomore Year     During the sophomore year, students begin to define their concentration. Sophomores often take at least one Gallatin interdisciplinary seminar, and many select a sophomore-only interdisciplinary seminar.     Recent sophomore-only seminars include\u201cAmerican Narratives I,\u201d \u201cLiterary and Critical Theory,\u201d and \u201cShakespeare's Mediterranean.\u201d         At the end of the sophomore year, each student writes the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration, a short essay that is read and approved by his or her faculty adviser. This plan details the steps the student will take towards defining his or her concentration.   Sophomores are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in the other schools of NYU, and many also choose to study abroad for a semester.   Sophomores often undertake internships related to their fields of study in various businesses, cultural institutions, and nonprofit organizations throughout New York City.   Sophomores may also choose to pursue their work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.           Junior Year          Juniors often take several Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars.    In the junior year, students continue to deepen their knowledge in their chosen fields of study by taking courses widely in other departments and schools at NYU.    During the junior year, students begin preparing for their senior colloquium by taking the course, \u201cThird-Year Symposium,\u201d which guides them through the process of writing the rationale, a short essay with booklist that defines the focus of their colloquium. The rationale is read and approved by two faculty members.    Juniors often undertake internships related to their fields of study and may do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.    Juniors may also take advantage of study abroad options, perhaps for one semester or even for one year. Particularly popular study abroad options for Gallatin students are NYU in Prague, NYU in Ghana, and Gallatin-specific summer courses in Florence, Berlin, and Buenos Aires.               Senior Year     In the fall of their senior year, students finalize plans for their senior colloquium, a two-hour oral exam and conversation involving three faculty members. At the colloquium, students present a variety of texts that have proved important in their concentration. These texts are selected to represent a range of knowledge, touching on topics both ancient and modern. The colloquium is that capstone event of a Gallatin education.     Students continue taking Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars in their senior year and also take advanced courses throughout the University in their fields of focus.   In the second semester of the senior year, students have the option to undertake a senior project or senior essay.   Seniors undertake internships related to their fields of study and may continue to do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.                      top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
