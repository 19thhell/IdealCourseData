The best engineers are adept not only at managing employees and technology but also at optimizing the organization of a business.   That&rsquo;s why, at the School of Engineering, we ask our students to take the unique approach of examining relationships rather than components. The MS in Industrial Engineering program teaches you to search for similarities in concepts, laws, and models across disciplines. From there, it&rsquo;s up to you to adapt, integrate, and exploit these similarities in innovative ways.   Because industrial engineers often work on multidisciplinary teams, we offer an elective-heavy curriculum. That approach lets you build expertise in whichever subjects best fit your career interests. These specialties include:      mechanical engineering    manufacturing    operations management    construction management    management of technology    electrical engineering     Admission Requirements   You must hold a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in a related discipline from an accredited institution and be able to demonstrate a superior undergraduate academic record. Applicants who do not meet these requirements are considered individually for admission and may be admitted subject to their completion of courses to remove deficiencies. Candidates are encouraged to seek waivers (and have approved substitutes designated) for all required courses in which they can demonstrate competence, thereby using their time effectively.   You must also have knowledge of engineering economics and probability and statistics. Prospective students lacking the relevant knowledge may satisfy the requirement by taking probability and statistics (MA 6513 or equivalent). Up to 3 credits of graduate courses in this category of prerequisite knowledge can be counted toward the degree as electives, although the electives needed for your concentration also must be satisfied.
