All new entering students must register for this course.  Course Description: In this introductory class to Latin American and Caribbean Studies we will approach the history and culture of Amerindian, European and colonial societies during the expansion of the Iberian monarchies in the Early Modern Atlantic World. Castilian, Portuguese, Mediterranean, West African, Mesoamerican and Andean peoples, among others, became, through coercion, free will, or mere accident, protagonists of the emergence of a mestizo society in the Americas: Colonial Latin America. While formally ruled by Iberian, Catholic laws, customs and literate traditions, this society was built on diversity and contained acute contradictions and conflicts. People worked out these conflicts through the idioms and practices of everyday violence, formal litigation, open or subtle resistance and, finally, revolutions. Colonial Latin America reveals histories of success and failure of individual, regional, continental and global consequences. In order to engage the full geographic and chronological dimensions of the history of colonial Latin America, we will concentrate on specific instances and scholarly debates about the social and cultural dynamics of empire (in Europe, Mesoamerica and the Andes), colonial expansion, labor control, economic exploitation, religion, gender, and politics. We structure our thinking around key critical concepts and a larger reflection on the nature of historical argument. We will try to understand the core questions behind each of our assigned readings, how each defines and analyzes evidence, and the construction of its argument. Throughout the semester, we will compare and contrast questions, methods, and arguments. Students will develop and practice research skills to serve their own future research.    LATC-GA 3200 - Reading and Writing Workshop Day/Time: Thursday, 9:30am - 12:00pm Prof: Katherine Smith Location: 404W KJCC Course Syllabus Course Description:This course is designed as a writing workshop for CLACS students finishing their Masters\u2019 Projects. During the semester, students will transform their extensive summer field research into their final masters\u2019 project paper.    In weekly workshops, we will address the essentials of good academic research and writing. Students will participate in peer-review workshops throughout the semester, building on different stages of their thesis projects. We start by evaluating summer field research with strategies for organizing and interpreting research materials and findings. Then, we focus on refining the central thesis arguments and on positioning the arguments within the existing scholarship. In this process, we will continue to build and reshape the literature review/historiography. The final weeks of the class will be devoted to peer-review workshops on outlines, presentations and thesis paper drafts. The writing assignments and workshops are designed as practical guides to improve research and writing skills in the genre of thesis writing. The schedule intends to keep students on a realistic writing schedule to provide the support and motivation to finish high-quality masters\u2019 theses papers.

How do we relate to each other through music? And how does music cross linguistic, political, social, and ethnic boundaries? This course will take up some of these questions as it explores a few historical instances in which music has traveled extensively, finding listeners in a wide array of places. We will revisit the reception and performance of different musics in the Americas and beyond to consider how rhythms and compositions were resituated in different contexts, with particular concern for their roles in bridging between members of different diasporas. Throughout the course, we\u2019ll listen to musical examples from Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, New Orleans, New York, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast, while reading interventions by critics and musicians regarding these musics, their contexts, and their theoretical implications.    Back to top    Elective Courses     LATC-GA 1014 \u2013 Special Topics: Comparative Racisms in the Americas Day/Time: Thursday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: This seminar will explore emergent forms of racism in the Americas as major obstacles to the construction of intercultural relations, racial and economic justice, and democracy. The emergence of these \u201cnew or renewed racisms\u201d is still largely a relatively uncharted terrain in the social sciences. The course will thus explore this phenomenon as integral to the multicultural and what some have called \u201cpost racial\u201d present defined by larger processes of economic and cultural globalization and transnational migration. Throughout the course, we will also look at these emergent racisms in relation to the challenges facing indigenous and afro-descendant social movements, middle class political networks, and state and non-governmental institutions that seek to deepen democracy in the hemisphere by building the basis for active citizenship and racial and economic justice.    The following general questions will guide our analysis and discussion: What is the relationship between institutionalized racism, embedded in the fabric of these societies, and specific \u201cracial eruptions,\u201d which appear to stand in contrast to prevailing ideologies of pluralism and intercultural relations? How to explain the persistence of racial hierarchy in societies where powerful actors explicitly endorse principles of multicultural recognition and racial equality? Does government-endorsed multiculturalism mitigate the negative impact of extractive, industrial, informal and other economic activities on indigenous and afro-descendant peoples? Or alternatively, do these economies actually lay the groundwork for what could be considered a \u201cracialized\u201d economic order? How do the push and pull of migration tied to larger necessities of capital accumulation and labor exploitation shape the dynamics and logics of racism within the region? What types of constitutional reforms, legislative and public policy agendas have emerged to address these dynamics and logics? LATC-GA 1020 \u2013 Engage, Exile, and Errancy: Narrating Haiti After the U.S. Occupation Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:55pm-7:35pm Prof. Michael Dash Location: 20 Cooper Square, Room 4-A Course Syllabus/admin/ContentPageEditAction.ion?method=setup&amp;key=29419 Course Description: Neither simply \u201cAfrica\u2019s Oldest Daughter\u201d, nor the place where \u201cnegritude stood up for the first time\u201d nor \u201cBlack Baghdad\u201d, the nation of Haiti was created from the most radical revolution of its time. The application of universal human rights in the revolution in colonial St. Domingue meant both that the ideals of the Enlightenment would be put to their hardest test in a most unexpected place and signaled the unpredictable possibilities of global interaction in a modern world where the periphery could be become the site for concrete application of ideas emanating from the center. Nevertheless, the global, historical and ideological implications of this revolution have been largely ignored or suppressed even in such revolutionary texts as Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth and more recently Paul Gilroy\u2019s study of black internationalism The Black Atlantic. Using the ideas of revolutionary universalism writing after the U.S. intervention of 1915 will be read not just in terms of nationalist resistance but rather as a continuation of the revolutionary ideals of 1804, which situated Haiti within a global revolutionary modernity. Literary indigenism reactivated Haiti\u2019s transnational connections and pointed as much to an isolationist noirisme as a cosmopolitan identity in the Americas. This perspective is followed in the figure of the migrant, recurrent in the fictions of displacement by Roumain and Alexis that follow the disruptive effect of U.S. imperialism. Duvalierism and its repercussions will be treated in the trilogy Love, Anger Madness by Marie Vieux-Chauvet and the psychic space of the new displaced errant subject examined in the works of Edwidge Danticat and Emile Ollivier. The course concludes with Haiti\u2019s violent transition to democracy in the work of Lyonel Trouillot and Jonathan Demme\u2019s Agronome and Laferriere\u2019s view of the reconstruction of Haiti after the January 12 earthquake.    DRAP-GA 1048 \u2013 International Studies in Human Rights Day/Time: Monday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: This purpose of this class is to introduce students to international human rights and the movement\u2019s relationship to the field of comprehensive peace education. As an multi-disciplinary field, peace education takes a holistic approach to conflict and education. Essentially, peace education is the creation and transmission of knowledge needed to achieve and maintain peace. It is also about developing the critical and reflective capacities to apply knowledge in order to control, reduce, and eliminate various forms of violence. Using a peace education approach, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related normative global standards will be used as the primary conceptual frameworks to guide our inquiries.    LATC-GA 1023 \u2013 Latinos in Urban Schools Day/Time: Monday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Edward A. Fergus Location: Silver 508 Course Syllabus Course Description: The growing presence of Latinos in US public schools, specifically urban schools, begs targeted examination of their learning and social outcomes. Though often referred to as a pan-ethnic label, Latinos represent a myriad of nationalities, racial classifications and immigrant generations from North and South America. This course is designed to introduce graduate students to the varying sociological explanations of how and why social demographic factors among Latinos (immigrant status, generation, skin color, gender, class, language ability, and national group) operate in learning and social outcomes. This will involve engaging substantive theories (e.g., social and cultural reproduction theories, status attainment, cultural ecological theory, urban culture theories, etc.) in their explanations of Latino students\u2019 learning and social outcomes. Students are expected to have some familiarity with these theories. At times, the course will seem as if we are moving through various topics with multiple layers, however the intent of the course is to provide some organization in how to think about the explanations of learning and social outcomes among Latino students.    LATC-GA 2030.001 \u2013 Topics: Literature and Cinema Before Authoritarian State. Cuba, 1960 - 2010 Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:15 - 6:15pm Prof. Antonio Jos\u00e9 Ponte Location: TBA Course Description: Cuatro d\u00e9cadas de relaciones entre artistas y poder pol\u00edtico que no se reducen solamente (como el t\u00edtulo de este curso podr\u00eda hacer suponer) a la represi\u00f3n y el ejercicio de la fuerza, sino que incluye tambi\u00e9n la seducci\u00f3n y las gratificaciones. Cuatro d\u00e9cadas de censuras y prohibiciones, pero tambi\u00e9n de creaci\u00f3n de un imponente aparato cultural. El cine cubano desde la creaci\u00f3n de una industria nacional y de una censura pol\u00edtica hasta los m\u00e1s recientes ejercicios de producciones independientes y contestatarias... La literatura cubana desde las dudas del escritor sobre su libertad creativa hasta la rebeld\u00eda, el castigo y la publicaci\u00f3n de obras en el extranjero... Pero tambi\u00e9n un curso acerca de la autorepresentaci\u00f3n del poder pol\u00edtico y acerca de la imagen que algunos cineastas y escritores extranjeros se han hecho de una sociedad como la cubana contempor\u00e1nea.   LATC-GA 2030.002 \u2013 Topics: Nineteenth-Century Literature and Politics Day/Time: Monday, 4:15pm - 6:15pm Prof. Sibylle Fischer Location: TBA Course Description: In this seminar we will discuss some of the canonical literary and political texts of the nineteenth century in Latin America. This includes political writings from the independence period to mid-century, foundational novels, and late nineteenth-century naturalist and modernista texts. Depending on student interest, we may also include some Brazilian texts. Along with literary texts we will review some of the influential works of literary and historical scholarship of the last few decades. The goal of the seminar is to offer students a solid introduction to the key concepts, ideas, and research questions in nineteenth-century literary scholarship and political history. This seminar will be reading intensive, but does not require a final research paper. Students are expected to write weekly reaction papers (1 page), participate actively in discussion, and prepare a bibliographical essay, a historiography of an event, or a critical review of a body of literary criticism to be handed in the last day of class (approx. 10 pages). LATC-GA 2145 \u2013 Seminar in Latin America: US-Latin American Relations After WWII Day/Time: Monday, 2:00pm - 4:00pm Prof. Jorge Casta\u00f1eda and Columbia University Prof. John Coatsworth Location: 404W KJCC &amp; 802 International Affairs Building (Columbia University) (See Syllabus) Course Description: This class will be offered at NYU (7 weeks) and at Columbia University (7 weeks). The course seeks to analyze the dynamics and issues that describe relations between the United States and Latin America since the end of World War II. A complete picture of the current state of affairs in the hemisphere and the reasons that led to it require an analysis in three different \u2013 but related \u2013 dimensions. To cover the first one, the course analyzes historical benchmarks that contextualize particular overt American interventions in the region, dissecting its causes, operation and consequences. In a second dimension, the course looks at topics that have permeated the relationship between the United States and Latin America over this period. Because of their typically cross-national nature, they illustrate a different set of dynamics and concerns that have fueled tensions in the relationship. A third and final dimension concerns recent developments in Latin America that affect and have been affected by U.S. foreign policy. Their novelty suggests that these issues will remain relevant at least in the immediate future.    LATC-GA 2304 \u2013 Democracy, Culture and Power in Latin American Education Day/Time: Tuesday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: 404W KJCC Course Syllabus Course Description: Students will be given the opportunity to compare and contrast Freire\u2019s notion of dialogical education with intercultural and multilingual notions in relation to the construction of democracy and equality. This will provide a basis from which to unravel how state officialization of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multilingual Education involved its depolitization through the fading of its historical critical potential. In this light, we will examine how proponents of such officialization chose to ignore critical pedagogy, critical race theory and most of all the contributions and critiques made by feminists and critical gender theorists of education. The seminar will thus end with the exploration of such feminist critiques and those of indigenous women and men interested in \u201ctroubling\u201d the educational arena and taking the legacies and trajectories of Freirean approaches to education and of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multicultural Education proposals a step further.   HIST-GA 1800\u2013 Revolution in Latin America and the Caribbean Day/Time: Wednesday, 9:30am - 12:15pm Prof: Sinclair Thomson and Ada Ferrer Location: 324 KJCC    HIST-GA 2804\u2013 Research Seminar-The Politics of Labor in Latin American History Day/Time: Monday, 2:00pm - 4:45pm Prof: Barbara Weinstein Location: KJCC 701 Course Description: This is not a course about labor politics in the usual sense. It is not primarily about organized labor or working-class movements or even working-class culture. Rather, it is about changing definitions and meanings of labor, and their social, cultural, and political implications. It starts with the premise that the concept of work has been especially complex and vexing in Latin American culture given its long history of associating physical labor with low status, and a leisured lifestyle with prestige and respectability. Yet, as Latin American and Caribbean societies began the transition from colony to nation and constructed notions of citizenship and modernity in that historical context, traditional ideas about labor and respectability began to be challenged and reformulated. Work became, at least for some segments of society, a basis on which to claim rights, and the lines between leisure and laziness began to be questioned. Hierarchies of labor\u2014mental vs. manual, dependent vs. autonomous, skilled vs. menial, manly vs. womanly\u2014informed notions of respectability and power. And running through all of these categories were questions of race, which could mark someone as an exploitable body on the one hand, but incapable of self-discipline on the other.    Back to top    Quechua Courses  LATC-GA 10 - Beginning Quechua I Day/Time: MTR, 9:30am - 10:45am Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: 25 W4-C16 Course Syllabus  Course Description: Quechua is the most important and most widely distributed indigenous language in South America, with about 10 million speakers living from the high mountains to the tropical lowlands in Colombia (where the language is called Ingano), Ecuador (where it is called kichwa or runa shimi, \"human speech\"), Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina (where it is usually spelled Quechua and called, by its speakers, runa simi). Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures. Students who satisfactorily complete introductory Quechua will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.

Bergdoll Location: 934 Schermerhorn Hall (Columbia University) Course Description: Survey of major developments, figures, and artistic centers in Latin America from the 1920s to the mid-1980s with particular emphasis on historiographic revisions. The course will focus principally on developments in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, and Cuba.     LATC-GA 2535-001 \u2013 Slave Memory in Brazil: Public History and Audiovisual Narratives in Atlantic Perspective  Day/Time: Monday/Wednesday, 4:10pm-5:25pm Prof: Hebe Mattos Location: 310 Fayerweather (Columbia University) Course Syllabus  Course Description: The research on the making of racial identities in Brazil and on the history of Brazilian black culture and black social movements increase significantly in the last twenty years, dialoguing directly with the idea of being part of the African diaspora at the Atlantic. The discussion of the content of audiovisual resources related with this process allows connecting the contemporary discussion about public memory of slavery in Brazil with the globalized perspective of politics of identity in the Atlantic World.     LATC-GA 2536-001 \u2013 Historiography of Latin America, Modern Period Day/Time: Tuesday, 6:10pm - 8:00pm Prof. Pablo Piccato Location: 311 Fayerweather (Columbia University) Course Syllabus  Course Description: This graduate colloquium will introduce students to the literature of modern Latin American history, discussing both recent and early books. Readings will include examples of the most important areas of research in the region, with an emphasis on the diversity of approaches that has characterized the historiography on post-independence Latin America in the last twenty years, from political history to studies of culture and economic development. Topics will include republicanism and the formation of nation states, peasant societies, social movements, gender, populism and new political languages and identities in the twentieth century.     LATC-GA 2538-001 \u2013 From State Building to Nation Building: 19th Century in Mexico Day/Time: Wednesday, 2:10pm - 4:00pm Prof. Frida Osorio Location: 802 International Affairs Building (Columbia University) Course Syllabus  Course Description: The purpose of this seminar is to analyze the formation and consolidation of the modern Mexican State during the 19th century. Through the critical lens of historiography, three interrelated topics will be studied: the political challenges inherited by the crisis of Hispanic monarchy; elite striving to build a viable State; and the contradictions that were produced by the process of State building.    LATC-GA 2537-001 \u2013 Immigration, Cities, States Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:10pm - 6:00pm Prof. Saskia J. Sassen Location: 103 Knox Hall (Columbia University) Course Description: Transnational processes such as economic globalization and cross-border migrations confront the social sciences with a series of theoretical and methodological challenges. This course examines these challenges through a focus oon both macro level cross-border flows and micro processes which might take place at a global or at a sub-national level. Particular attention will go to analyzing the challenges for theorization and empirical specification.    Please follow the approved procedures carefully when registering for a Columbia course.

Nevertheless, the global, historical and ideological implications of this revolution have been largely ignored or suppressed even in such revolutionary texts as Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth and more recently Paul Gilroy\u2019s study of black internationalism The Black Atlantic. Using the ideas of revolutionary universalism writing after the U.S. intervention of 1915 will be read not just in terms of nationalist resistance but rather as a continuation of the revolutionary ideals of 1804, which situated Haiti within a global revolutionary modernity. Literary indigenism reactivated Haiti\u2019s transnational connections and pointed as much to an isolationist noirisme as a cosmopolitan identity in the Americas. This perspective is followed in the figure of the migrant, recurrent in the fictions of displacement by Roumain and Alexis that follow the disruptive effect of U.S. imperialism. Duvalierism and its repercussions will be treated in the trilogy Love, Anger Madness by Marie Vieux-Chauvet and the psychic space of the new displaced errant subject examined in the works of Edwidge Danticat and Emile Ollivier. The course concludes with Haiti\u2019s violent transition to democracy in the work of Lyonel Trouillot and Jonathan Demme\u2019s Agronome and Laferriere\u2019s view of the reconstruction of Haiti after the January 12 earthquake.    DRAP-GA 1048 \u2013 International Studies in Human Rights Day/Time: Monday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: This purpose of this class is to introduce students to international human rights and the movement\u2019s relationship to the field of comprehensive peace education. As an multi-disciplinary field, peace education takes a holistic approach to conflict and education. Essentially, peace education is the creation and transmission of knowledge needed to achieve and maintain peace. It is also about developing the critical and reflective capacities to apply knowledge in order to control, reduce, and eliminate various forms of violence. Using a peace education approach, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related normative global standards will be used as the primary conceptual frameworks to guide our inquiries.    LATC-GA 1023 \u2013 Latinos in Urban Schools Day/Time: Monday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Edward A. Fergus Location: Silver 508 Course Syllabus Course Description: The growing presence of Latinos in US public schools, specifically urban schools, begs targeted examination of their learning and social outcomes. Though often referred to as a pan-ethnic label, Latinos represent a myriad of nationalities, racial classifications and immigrant generations from North and South America. This course is designed to introduce graduate students to the varying sociological explanations of how and why social demographic factors among Latinos (immigrant status, generation, skin color, gender, class, language ability, and national group) operate in learning and social outcomes. This will involve engaging substantive theories (e.g., social and cultural reproduction theories, status attainment, cultural ecological theory, urban culture theories, etc.) in their explanations of Latino students\u2019 learning and social outcomes. Students are expected to have some familiarity with these theories. At times, the course will seem as if we are moving through various topics with multiple layers, however the intent of the course is to provide some organization in how to think about the explanations of learning and social outcomes among Latino students.    LATC-GA 2030.001 \u2013 Topics: Literature and Cinema Before Authoritarian State. Cuba, 1960 - 2010 Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:15 - 6:15pm Prof. Antonio Jos\u00e9 Ponte Location: TBA Course Description: Cuatro d\u00e9cadas de relaciones entre artistas y poder pol\u00edtico que no se reducen solamente (como el t\u00edtulo de este curso podr\u00eda hacer suponer) a la represi\u00f3n y el ejercicio de la fuerza, sino que incluye tambi\u00e9n la seducci\u00f3n y las gratificaciones. Cuatro d\u00e9cadas de censuras y prohibiciones, pero tambi\u00e9n de creaci\u00f3n de un imponente aparato cultural. El cine cubano desde la creaci\u00f3n de una industria nacional y de una censura pol\u00edtica hasta los m\u00e1s recientes ejercicios de producciones independientes y contestatarias... La literatura cubana desde las dudas del escritor sobre su libertad creativa hasta la rebeld\u00eda, el castigo y la publicaci\u00f3n de obras en el extranjero... Pero tambi\u00e9n un curso acerca de la autorepresentaci\u00f3n del poder pol\u00edtico y acerca de la imagen que algunos cineastas y escritores extranjeros se han hecho de una sociedad como la cubana contempor\u00e1nea.   LATC-GA 2030.002 \u2013 Topics: Nineteenth-Century Literature and Politics Day/Time: Monday, 4:15pm - 6:15pm Prof. Sibylle Fischer Location: TBA Course Description: In this seminar we will discuss some of the canonical literary and political texts of the nineteenth century in Latin America. This includes political writings from the independence period to mid-century, foundational novels, and late nineteenth-century naturalist and modernista texts. Depending on student interest, we may also include some Brazilian texts. Along with literary texts we will review some of the influential works of literary and historical scholarship of the last few decades. The goal of the seminar is to offer students a solid introduction to the key concepts, ideas, and research questions in nineteenth-century literary scholarship and political history. This seminar will be reading intensive, but does not require a final research paper. Students are expected to write weekly reaction papers (1 page), participate actively in discussion, and prepare a bibliographical essay, a historiography of an event, or a critical review of a body of literary criticism to be handed in the last day of class (approx. 10 pages). LATC-GA 2145 \u2013 Seminar in Latin America: US-Latin American Relations After WWII Day/Time: Monday, 2:00pm - 4:00pm Prof. Jorge Casta\u00f1eda and Columbia University Prof. John Coatsworth Location: 404W KJCC &amp; 802 International Affairs Building (Columbia University) (See Syllabus) Course Description: This class will be offered at NYU (7 weeks) and at Columbia University (7 weeks). The course seeks to analyze the dynamics and issues that describe relations between the United States and Latin America since the end of World War II. A complete picture of the current state of affairs in the hemisphere and the reasons that led to it require an analysis in three different \u2013 but related \u2013 dimensions. To cover the first one, the course analyzes historical benchmarks that contextualize particular overt American interventions in the region, dissecting its causes, operation and consequences. In a second dimension, the course looks at topics that have permeated the relationship between the United States and Latin America over this period. Because of their typically cross-national nature, they illustrate a different set of dynamics and concerns that have fueled tensions in the relationship. A third and final dimension concerns recent developments in Latin America that affect and have been affected by U.S. foreign policy. Their novelty suggests that these issues will remain relevant at least in the immediate future.    LATC-GA 2304 \u2013 Democracy, Culture and Power in Latin American Education Day/Time: Tuesday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: 404W KJCC Course Syllabus Course Description: Students will be given the opportunity to compare and contrast Freire\u2019s notion of dialogical education with intercultural and multilingual notions in relation to the construction of democracy and equality. This will provide a basis from which to unravel how state officialization of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multilingual Education involved its depolitization through the fading of its historical critical potential. In this light, we will examine how proponents of such officialization chose to ignore critical pedagogy, critical race theory and most of all the contributions and critiques made by feminists and critical gender theorists of education. The seminar will thus end with the exploration of such feminist critiques and those of indigenous women and men interested in \u201ctroubling\u201d the educational arena and taking the legacies and trajectories of Freirean approaches to education and of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multicultural Education proposals a step further.   HIST-GA 1800\u2013 Revolution in Latin America and the Caribbean Day/Time: Wednesday, 9:30am - 12:15pm Prof: Sinclair Thomson and Ada Ferrer Location: 324 KJCC    HIST-GA 2804\u2013 Research Seminar-The Politics of Labor in Latin American History Day/Time: Monday, 2:00pm - 4:45pm Prof: Barbara Weinstein Location: KJCC 701 Course Description: This is not a course about labor politics in the usual sense. It is not primarily about organized labor or working-class movements or even working-class culture. Rather, it is about changing definitions and meanings of labor, and their social, cultural, and political implications. It starts with the premise that the concept of work has been especially complex and vexing in Latin American culture given its long history of associating physical labor with low status, and a leisured lifestyle with prestige and respectability. Yet, as Latin American and Caribbean societies began the transition from colony to nation and constructed notions of citizenship and modernity in that historical context, traditional ideas about labor and respectability began to be challenged and reformulated. Work became, at least for some segments of society, a basis on which to claim rights, and the lines between leisure and laziness began to be questioned. Hierarchies of labor\u2014mental vs. manual, dependent vs. autonomous, skilled vs. menial, manly vs. womanly\u2014informed notions of respectability and power. And running through all of these categories were questions of race, which could mark someone as an exploitable body on the one hand, but incapable of self-discipline on the other.    Back to top    Quechua Courses  LATC-GA 10 - Beginning Quechua I Day/Time: MTR, 9:30am - 10:45am Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: 25 W4-C16 Course Syllabus  Course Description: Quechua is the most important and most widely distributed indigenous language in South America, with about 10 million speakers living from the high mountains to the tropical lowlands in Colombia (where the language is called Ingano), Ecuador (where it is called kichwa or runa shimi, \"human speech\"), Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina (where it is usually spelled Quechua and called, by its speakers, runa simi). Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures. Students who satisfactorily complete introductory Quechua will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.

Bergdoll Location: 934 Schermerhorn Hall (Columbia University) Course Description: Survey of major developments, figures, and artistic centers in Latin America from the 1920s to the mid-1980s with particular emphasis on historiographic revisions. The course will focus principally on developments in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, and Cuba.     LATC-GA 2535-001 \u2013 Slave Memory in Brazil: Public History and Audiovisual Narratives in Atlantic Perspective  Day/Time: Monday/Wednesday, 4:10pm-5:25pm Prof: Hebe Mattos Location: 310 Fayerweather (Columbia University) Course Syllabus  Course Description: The research on the making of racial identities in Brazil and on the history of Brazilian black culture and black social movements increase significantly in the last twenty years, dialoguing directly with the idea of being part of the African diaspora at the Atlantic. The discussion of the content of audiovisual resources related with this process allows connecting the contemporary discussion about public memory of slavery in Brazil with the globalized perspective of politics of identity in the Atlantic World.     LATC-GA 2536-001 \u2013 Historiography of Latin America, Modern Period Day/Time: Tuesday, 6:10pm - 8:00pm Prof. Pablo Piccato Location: 311 Fayerweather (Columbia University) Course Syllabus  Course Description: This graduate colloquium will introduce students to the literature of modern Latin American history, discussing both recent and early books. Readings will include examples of the most important areas of research in the region, with an emphasis on the diversity of approaches that has characterized the historiography on post-independence Latin America in the last twenty years, from political history to studies of culture and economic development. Topics will include republicanism and the formation of nation states, peasant societies, social movements, gender, populism and new political languages and identities in the twentieth century.     LATC-GA 2538-001 \u2013 From State Building to Nation Building: 19th Century in Mexico Day/Time: Wednesday, 2:10pm - 4:00pm Prof. Frida Osorio Location: 802 International Affairs Building (Columbia University) Course Syllabus  Course Description: The purpose of this seminar is to analyze the formation and consolidation of the modern Mexican State during the 19th century. Through the critical lens of historiography, three interrelated topics will be studied: the political challenges inherited by the crisis of Hispanic monarchy; elite striving to build a viable State; and the contradictions that were produced by the process of State building.    LATC-GA 2537-001 \u2013 Immigration, Cities, States Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:10pm - 6:00pm Prof. Saskia J. Sassen Location: 103 Knox Hall (Columbia University) Course Description: Transnational processes such as economic globalization and cross-border migrations confront the social sciences with a series of theoretical and methodological challenges. This course examines these challenges through a focus oon both macro level cross-border flows and micro processes which might take place at a global or at a sub-national level. Particular attention will go to analyzing the challenges for theorization and empirical specification.    Please follow the approved procedures carefully when registering for a Columbia course.

All new entering students must register for this course.  Course Description: This course is both a history of the peoples, cultures, and nations of Iberia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and a history and wide-ranging survey of the various disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to the area, including the Area Studies paradigm itself. Some of the readings are included as a means to explore the boundaries of the established disciplines. The purpose is not only to introduce Latin American and Caribbean realities but to review the scholarly, intellectual, and political frameworks according to which these realities are discerned. Latinamericanist and Caribbeanist faculty from throughout the university will be invited to speak about the history of the disciplinary and interdisciplinary frameworks for the study of the region, as well as the prevailing methods in the present moment. Some sessions will be led by guest faculty; discussion in all sessions will be facilitated by student study group presentations. Part I of the course covers the pre-invasion Americas, Iberia, and the production of the Imperial/Colonial world and the \"first modernity\" through the early republican era, the mid-19th century. It also introduces the background to the genesis of plantation societies in Spanish America and Portuguese Brazil, and the contesting colonial projects in the Caribbean region, also involving slave plantation labor, of Britain, France, and the Dutch.    LATC-GA 3200 - Research and Writing Workshop Day/Time: Thursday 10:00-12:30 Prof: Katherine Smith Location: KJCC 404W Course Syllabus Course Description:      This course is designed as a writing workshop for CLACS students finishing their Masters\u2019 Projects. During the semester, students will transform their extensive summer field research into their final masters\u2019 project paper.  In weekly workshops, we will address the essentials of good academic research and writing. Students will participate in peer-review workshops throughout the semester, building on different stages of their thesis projects. We start by evaluating summer field research with strategies for organizing and interpreting research materials and findings. Then, we focus on refining the central thesis arguments and on positioning the arguments within the existing scholarship. In this process, we will continue to build and reshape the literature review/historiography. The final weeks of the class will be devoted to peer-review workshops on outlines, presentations and thesis paper drafts.  The writing assignments and workshops are designed as practical guides to improve research and writing skills in the genre of thesis writing. The schedule intends to keep students on a realistic writing schedule to provide the support and motivation to finish high-quality masters\u2019 theses papers by mid-December 2014.

LATC-GA 1014 \u2013 Special Topics: Comparative Racisms in the Americas Day/Time: Thursday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: This seminar will explore emergent forms of racism in the Americas as major obstacles to the construction of intercultural relations, racial and economic justice, and democracy. The emergence of these \u201cnew or renewed racisms\u201d is still largely a relatively uncharted terrain in the social sciences. The course will thus explore this phenomenon as integral to the multicultural and what some have called \u201cpost racial\u201d present defined by larger processes of economic and cultural globalization and transnational migration. Throughout the course, we will also look at these emergent racisms in relation to the challenges facing indigenous and afro-descendant social movements, middle class political networks, and state and non-governmental institutions that seek to deepen democracy in the hemisphere by building the basis for active citizenship and racial and economic justice.    The following general questions will guide our analysis and discussion: What is the relationship between institutionalized racism, embedded in the fabric of these societies, and specific \u201cracial eruptions,\u201d which appear to stand in contrast to prevailing ideologies of pluralism and intercultural relations? How to explain the persistence of racial hierarchy in societies where powerful actors explicitly endorse principles of multicultural recognition and racial equality? Does government-endorsed multiculturalism mitigate the negative impact of extractive, industrial, informal and other economic activities on indigenous and afro-descendant peoples? Or alternatively, do these economies actually lay the groundwork for what could be considered a \u201cracialized\u201d economic order? How do the push and pull of migration tied to larger necessities of capital accumulation and labor exploitation shape the dynamics and logics of racism within the region? What types of constitutional reforms, legislative and public policy agendas have emerged to address these dynamics and logics?    DRAP-GA 1048 \u2013 International Studies in Human Rights Day/Time: Monday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: This purpose of this class is to introduce students to international human rights and the movement\u2019s relationship to the field of comprehensive peace education.

CINE-GT 1155 \u2013 Mexican Cinema Day/Time: Thursday, 12:30pm - 4:30pm Prof. Lauro Zavalla Location: See Albert Course Description: Offering an overview of the main film genres in the history of Mexican cinema, with emphasis on the so-called Golden Age (1945-1954), and the first decade of the 21st century. The course will be focused on identifying the forms of representation of Mexican identity through the study of key film sequences. Considering that most Mexican films are not available with English subtitles, the instructor will project selected fragments of specific films to support the concepts and stimulate the discussion. Also, this seminar will be accompanied with Course Notes produced for this purpose. It is expected that each student will write a 5 to 7 double-spaced essay on any film or group of films studied in the course, emphasizing their historical relevance.

This will provide a basis from which to unravel how state officialization of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multilingual Education involved its depolitization through the fading of its historical critical potential. In this light, we will examine how proponents of such officialization chose to ignore critical pedagogy, critical race theory and most of all the contributions and critiques made by feminists and critical gender theorists of education. The seminar will thus end with the exploration of such feminist critiques and those of indigenous women and men interested in \u201ctroubling\u201d the educational arena and taking the legacies and trajectories of Freirean approaches to education and of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multicultural Education proposals a step further.  LATC-GA 2537 \u2013 Latin American and Caribbean Intellectual History Day/Time: Monday, 12:00pm - 2:30pm Prof. Dylon Robbins Location: 404W KJCC Course Description: In this course, we will explore some of the key texts and ideas in the intellectual history of Latin America and the Caribbean. How have Latin American and Caribbean intellectuals approached the problems of culture and difference? How have they theorized the state, civil society, or the public sphere? How have notions of gender, heterogeneity, race and ethnicity, and nationalism related to their historical contexts? A review of texts including \u00c1ngel Rama, Jean Franco, Gilberto Freyre, Marilena Chaui, Fernando Ortiz, Suely Rolnik, Roberto Schwarz, Jamaica Kincaid, C.L.R.

All new entering students must register for this course.  Course Description: In this introductory class to Latin American and Caribbean Studies we will approach the history and culture of Amerindian, European and colonial societies during the expansion of the Iberian monarchies in the Early Modern Atlantic World. Castilian, Portuguese, Mediterranean, West African, Mesoamerican and Andean peoples, among others, became, through coercion, free will, or mere accident, protagonists of the emergence of a mestizo society in the Americas: Colonial Latin America. While formally ruled by Iberian, Catholic laws, customs and literate traditions, this society was built on diversity and contained acute contradictions and conflicts. People worked out these conflicts through the idioms and practices of everyday violence, formal litigation, open or subtle resistance and, finally, revolutions. Colonial Latin America reveals histories of success and failure of individual, regional, continental and global consequences. In order to engage the full geographic and chronological dimensions of the history of colonial Latin America, we will concentrate on specific instances and scholarly debates about the social and cultural dynamics of empire (in Europe, Mesoamerica and the Andes), colonial expansion, labor control, economic exploitation, religion, gender, and politics. We structure our thinking around key critical concepts and a larger reflection on the nature of historical argument. We will try to understand the core questions behind each of our assigned readings, how each defines and analyzes evidence, and the construction of its argument. Throughout the semester, we will compare and contrast questions, methods, and arguments. Students will develop and practice research skills to serve their own future research.    LATC-GA 3200 - Reading and Writing Workshop Day/Time: Thursday, 9:30am - 12:00pm Prof: Katherine Smith Location: 404W KJCC Course Syllabus Course Description:This course is designed as a writing workshop for CLACS students finishing their Masters\u2019 Projects. During the semester, students will transform their extensive summer field research into their final masters\u2019 project paper.    In weekly workshops, we will address the essentials of good academic research and writing. Students will participate in peer-review workshops throughout the semester, building on different stages of their thesis projects. We start by evaluating summer field research with strategies for organizing and interpreting research materials and findings. Then, we focus on refining the central thesis arguments and on positioning the arguments within the existing scholarship. In this process, we will continue to build and reshape the literature review/historiography. The final weeks of the class will be devoted to peer-review workshops on outlines, presentations and thesis paper drafts. The writing assignments and workshops are designed as practical guides to improve research and writing skills in the genre of thesis writing. The schedule intends to keep students on a realistic writing schedule to provide the support and motivation to finish high-quality masters\u2019 theses papers.    Back to top    Colloquium Courses     LATC-GA 2590 \u2013 Interdisciplinary Seminar: Afro-Latin Soundscapes Day/Time: Monday, 4:00pm - 6:00pm Prof. Dylon Robbins Location: 404W KJCC Course Description: How does what you listen to shape your sense of self? How do we relate to each other through music? And how does music cross linguistic, political, social, and ethnic boundaries? This course will take up some of these questions as it explores a few historical instances in which music has traveled extensively, finding listeners in a wide array of places. We will revisit the reception and performance of different musics in the Americas and beyond to consider how rhythms and compositions were resituated in different contexts, with particular concern for their roles in bridging between members of different diasporas. Throughout the course, we\u2019ll listen to musical examples from Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, New Orleans, New York, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast, while reading interventions by critics and musicians regarding these musics, their contexts, and their theoretical implications.    Back to top    Elective Courses     LATC-GA 1014 \u2013 Special Topics: Comparative Racisms in the Americas Day/Time: Thursday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: This seminar will explore emergent forms of racism in the Americas as major obstacles to the construction of intercultural relations, racial and economic justice, and democracy. The emergence of these \u201cnew or renewed racisms\u201d is still largely a relatively uncharted terrain in the social sciences. The course will thus explore this phenomenon as integral to the multicultural and what some have called \u201cpost racial\u201d present defined by larger processes of economic and cultural globalization and transnational migration. Throughout the course, we will also look at these emergent racisms in relation to the challenges facing indigenous and afro-descendant social movements, middle class political networks, and state and non-governmental institutions that seek to deepen democracy in the hemisphere by building the basis for active citizenship and racial and economic justice.    The following general questions will guide our analysis and discussion: What is the relationship between institutionalized racism, embedded in the fabric of these societies, and specific \u201cracial eruptions,\u201d which appear to stand in contrast to prevailing ideologies of pluralism and intercultural relations? How to explain the persistence of racial hierarchy in societies where powerful actors explicitly endorse principles of multicultural recognition and racial equality? Does government-endorsed multiculturalism mitigate the negative impact of extractive, industrial, informal and other economic activities on indigenous and afro-descendant peoples? Or alternatively, do these economies actually lay the groundwork for what could be considered a \u201cracialized\u201d economic order? How do the push and pull of migration tied to larger necessities of capital accumulation and labor exploitation shape the dynamics and logics of racism within the region? What types of constitutional reforms, legislative and public policy agendas have emerged to address these dynamics and logics? LATC-GA 1020 \u2013 Engage, Exile, and Errancy: Narrating Haiti After the U.S. Occupation Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:55pm-7:35pm Prof. Michael Dash Location: 20 Cooper Square, Room 4-A Course Syllabus/admin/ContentPageEditAction.ion?method=setup&amp;key=29419 Course Description: Neither simply \u201cAfrica\u2019s Oldest Daughter\u201d, nor the place where \u201cnegritude stood up for the first time\u201d nor \u201cBlack Baghdad\u201d, the nation of Haiti was created from the most radical revolution of its time. The application of universal human rights in the revolution in colonial St. Domingue meant both that the ideals of the Enlightenment would be put to their hardest test in a most unexpected place and signaled the unpredictable possibilities of global interaction in a modern world where the periphery could be become the site for concrete application of ideas emanating from the center. Nevertheless, the global, historical and ideological implications of this revolution have been largely ignored or suppressed even in such revolutionary texts as Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth and more recently Paul Gilroy\u2019s study of black internationalism The Black Atlantic. Using the ideas of revolutionary universalism writing after the U.S. intervention of 1915 will be read not just in terms of nationalist resistance but rather as a continuation of the revolutionary ideals of 1804, which situated Haiti within a global revolutionary modernity. Literary indigenism reactivated Haiti\u2019s transnational connections and pointed as much to an isolationist noirisme as a cosmopolitan identity in the Americas. This perspective is followed in the figure of the migrant, recurrent in the fictions of displacement by Roumain and Alexis that follow the disruptive effect of U.S. imperialism. Duvalierism and its repercussions will be treated in the trilogy Love, Anger Madness by Marie Vieux-Chauvet and the psychic space of the new displaced errant subject examined in the works of Edwidge Danticat and Emile Ollivier. The course concludes with Haiti\u2019s violent transition to democracy in the work of Lyonel Trouillot and Jonathan Demme\u2019s Agronome and Laferriere\u2019s view of the reconstruction of Haiti after the January 12 earthquake.    DRAP-GA 1048 \u2013 International Studies in Human Rights Day/Time: Monday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: This purpose of this class is to introduce students to international human rights and the movement\u2019s relationship to the field of comprehensive peace education. As an multi-disciplinary field, peace education takes a holistic approach to conflict and education. Essentially, peace education is the creation and transmission of knowledge needed to achieve and maintain peace. It is also about developing the critical and reflective capacities to apply knowledge in order to control, reduce, and eliminate various forms of violence. Using a peace education approach, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related normative global standards will be used as the primary conceptual frameworks to guide our inquiries.    LATC-GA 1023 \u2013 Latinos in Urban Schools Day/Time: Monday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Edward A. Fergus Location: Silver 508 Course Syllabus Course Description: The growing presence of Latinos in US public schools, specifically urban schools, begs targeted examination of their learning and social outcomes. Though often referred to as a pan-ethnic label, Latinos represent a myriad of nationalities, racial classifications and immigrant generations from North and South America. This course is designed to introduce graduate students to the varying sociological explanations of how and why social demographic factors among Latinos (immigrant status, generation, skin color, gender, class, language ability, and national group) operate in learning and social outcomes. This will involve engaging substantive theories (e.g., social and cultural reproduction theories, status attainment, cultural ecological theory, urban culture theories, etc.) in their explanations of Latino students\u2019 learning and social outcomes. Students are expected to have some familiarity with these theories. At times, the course will seem as if we are moving through various topics with multiple layers, however the intent of the course is to provide some organization in how to think about the explanations of learning and social outcomes among Latino students.    LATC-GA 2030.001 \u2013 Topics: Literature and Cinema Before Authoritarian State. Cuba, 1960 - 2010 Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:15 - 6:15pm Prof. Antonio Jos\u00e9 Ponte Location: TBA Course Description: Cuatro d\u00e9cadas de relaciones entre artistas y poder pol\u00edtico que no se reducen solamente (como el t\u00edtulo de este curso podr\u00eda hacer suponer) a la represi\u00f3n y el ejercicio de la fuerza, sino que incluye tambi\u00e9n la seducci\u00f3n y las gratificaciones. Cuatro d\u00e9cadas de censuras y prohibiciones, pero tambi\u00e9n de creaci\u00f3n de un imponente aparato cultural. El cine cubano desde la creaci\u00f3n de una industria nacional y de una censura pol\u00edtica hasta los m\u00e1s recientes ejercicios de producciones independientes y contestatarias... La literatura cubana desde las dudas del escritor sobre su libertad creativa hasta la rebeld\u00eda, el castigo y la publicaci\u00f3n de obras en el extranjero... Pero tambi\u00e9n un curso acerca de la autorepresentaci\u00f3n del poder pol\u00edtico y acerca de la imagen que algunos cineastas y escritores extranjeros se han hecho de una sociedad como la cubana contempor\u00e1nea.   LATC-GA 2030.002 \u2013 Topics: Nineteenth-Century Literature and Politics Day/Time: Monday, 4:15pm - 6:15pm Prof. Sibylle Fischer Location: TBA Course Description: In this seminar we will discuss some of the canonical literary and political texts of the nineteenth century in Latin America. This includes political writings from the independence period to mid-century, foundational novels, and late nineteenth-century naturalist and modernista texts. Depending on student interest, we may also include some Brazilian texts. Along with literary texts we will review some of the influential works of literary and historical scholarship of the last few decades. The goal of the seminar is to offer students a solid introduction to the key concepts, ideas, and research questions in nineteenth-century literary scholarship and political history. This seminar will be reading intensive, but does not require a final research paper. Students are expected to write weekly reaction papers (1 page), participate actively in discussion, and prepare a bibliographical essay, a historiography of an event, or a critical review of a body of literary criticism to be handed in the last day of class (approx. 10 pages). LATC-GA 2145 \u2013 Seminar in Latin America: US-Latin American Relations After WWII Day/Time: Monday, 2:00pm - 4:00pm Prof. Jorge Casta\u00f1eda and Columbia University Prof. John Coatsworth Location: 404W KJCC &amp; 802 International Affairs Building (Columbia University) (See Syllabus) Course Description: This class will be offered at NYU (7 weeks) and at Columbia University (7 weeks). The course seeks to analyze the dynamics and issues that describe relations between the United States and Latin America since the end of World War II. A complete picture of the current state of affairs in the hemisphere and the reasons that led to it require an analysis in three different \u2013 but related \u2013 dimensions. To cover the first one, the course analyzes historical benchmarks that contextualize particular overt American interventions in the region, dissecting its causes, operation and consequences. In a second dimension, the course looks at topics that have permeated the relationship between the United States and Latin America over this period. Because of their typically cross-national nature, they illustrate a different set of dynamics and concerns that have fueled tensions in the relationship. A third and final dimension concerns recent developments in Latin America that affect and have been affected by U.S. foreign policy. Their novelty suggests that these issues will remain relevant at least in the immediate future.    LATC-GA 2304 \u2013 Democracy, Culture and Power in Latin American Education Day/Time: Tuesday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: 404W KJCC Course Syllabus Course Description: Students will be given the opportunity to compare and contrast Freire\u2019s notion of dialogical education with intercultural and multilingual notions in relation to the construction of democracy and equality. This will provide a basis from which to unravel how state officialization of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multilingual Education involved its depolitization through the fading of its historical critical potential. In this light, we will examine how proponents of such officialization chose to ignore critical pedagogy, critical race theory and most of all the contributions and critiques made by feminists and critical gender theorists of education. The seminar will thus end with the exploration of such feminist critiques and those of indigenous women and men interested in \u201ctroubling\u201d the educational arena and taking the legacies and trajectories of Freirean approaches to education and of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multicultural Education proposals a step further.   HIST-GA 1800\u2013 Revolution in Latin America and the Caribbean Day/Time: Wednesday, 9:30am - 12:15pm Prof: Sinclair Thomson and Ada Ferrer Location: 324 KJCC    HIST-GA 2804\u2013 Research Seminar-The Politics of Labor in Latin American History Day/Time: Monday, 2:00pm - 4:45pm Prof: Barbara Weinstein Location: KJCC 701 Course Description: This is not a course about labor politics in the usual sense. It is not primarily about organized labor or working-class movements or even working-class culture. Rather, it is about changing definitions and meanings of labor, and their social, cultural, and political implications. It starts with the premise that the concept of work has been especially complex and vexing in Latin American culture given its long history of associating physical labor with low status, and a leisured lifestyle with prestige and respectability. Yet, as Latin American and Caribbean societies began the transition from colony to nation and constructed notions of citizenship and modernity in that historical context, traditional ideas about labor and respectability began to be challenged and reformulated. Work became, at least for some segments of society, a basis on which to claim rights, and the lines between leisure and laziness began to be questioned. Hierarchies of labor\u2014mental vs. manual, dependent vs. autonomous, skilled vs. menial, manly vs. womanly\u2014informed notions of respectability and power. And running through all of these categories were questions of race, which could mark someone as an exploitable body on the one hand, but incapable of self-discipline on the other.    Back to top    Quechua Courses  LATC-GA 10 - Beginning Quechua I Day/Time: MTR, 9:30am - 10:45am Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: 25 W4-C16 Course Syllabus  Course Description: Quechua is the most important and most widely distributed indigenous language in South America, with about 10 million speakers living from the high mountains to the tropical lowlands in Colombia (where the language is called Ingano), Ecuador (where it is called kichwa or runa shimi, \"human speech\"), Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina (where it is usually spelled Quechua and called, by its speakers, runa simi). Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures. Students who satisfactorily complete introductory Quechua will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.    LATC-GA 20 - Intermediate Quechua I Day/Time: MTR, 12:30pm - 1:45pm Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: 25 W4-C12 Course Syllabus    LATC-GA 20 - Intermediate Quechua II Day/Time: TBA Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: TBA Please contact CLACS for eligibility and access code.

Bergdoll Location: 934 Schermerhorn Hall (Columbia University) Course Description: Survey of major developments, figures, and artistic centers in Latin America from the 1920s to the mid-1980s with particular emphasis on historiographic revisions. The course will focus principally on developments in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, and Cuba.     LATC-GA 2535-001 \u2013 Slave Memory in Brazil: Public History and Audiovisual Narratives in Atlantic Perspective  Day/Time: Monday/Wednesday, 4:10pm-5:25pm Prof: Hebe Mattos Location: 310 Fayerweather (Columbia University) Course Syllabus  Course Description: The research on the making of racial identities in Brazil and on the history of Brazilian black culture and black social movements increase significantly in the last twenty years, dialoguing directly with the idea of being part of the African diaspora at the Atlantic. The discussion of the content of audiovisual resources related with this process allows connecting the contemporary discussion about public memory of slavery in Brazil with the globalized perspective of politics of identity in the Atlantic World.     LATC-GA 2536-001 \u2013 Historiography of Latin America, Modern Period Day/Time: Tuesday, 6:10pm - 8:00pm Prof. Pablo Piccato Location: 311 Fayerweather (Columbia University) Course Syllabus  Course Description: This graduate colloquium will introduce students to the literature of modern Latin American history, discussing both recent and early books. Readings will include examples of the most important areas of research in the region, with an emphasis on the diversity of approaches that has characterized the historiography on post-independence Latin America in the last twenty years, from political history to studies of culture and economic development. Topics will include republicanism and the formation of nation states, peasant societies, social movements, gender, populism and new political languages and identities in the twentieth century.     LATC-GA 2538-001 \u2013 From State Building to Nation Building: 19th Century in Mexico Day/Time: Wednesday, 2:10pm - 4:00pm Prof. Frida Osorio Location: 802 International Affairs Building (Columbia University) Course Syllabus  Course Description: The purpose of this seminar is to analyze the formation and consolidation of the modern Mexican State during the 19th century. Through the critical lens of historiography, three interrelated topics will be studied: the political challenges inherited by the crisis of Hispanic monarchy; elite striving to build a viable State; and the contradictions that were produced by the process of State building.    LATC-GA 2537-001 \u2013 Immigration, Cities, States Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:10pm - 6:00pm Prof. Saskia J. Sassen Location: 103 Knox Hall (Columbia University) Course Description: Transnational processes such as economic globalization and cross-border migrations confront the social sciences with a series of theoretical and methodological challenges. This course examines these challenges through a focus oon both macro level cross-border flows and micro processes which might take place at a global or at a sub-national level. Particular attention will go to analyzing the challenges for theorization and empirical specification.    Please follow the approved procedures carefully when registering for a Columbia course.

All new entering students must register for this course.  Course Description: This course is both a history of the peoples, cultures, and nations of Iberia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and a history and wide-ranging survey of the various disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to the area, including the Area Studies paradigm itself. Some of the readings are included as a means to explore the boundaries of the established disciplines. The purpose is not only to introduce Latin American and Caribbean realities but to review the scholarly, intellectual, and political frameworks according to which these realities are discerned. Latinamericanist and Caribbeanist faculty from throughout the university will be invited to speak about the history of the disciplinary and interdisciplinary frameworks for the study of the region, as well as the prevailing methods in the present moment. Some sessions will be led by guest faculty; discussion in all sessions will be facilitated by student study group presentations. Part I of the course covers the pre-invasion Americas, Iberia, and the production of the Imperial/Colonial world and the \"first modernity\" through the early republican era, the mid-19th century. It also introduces the background to the genesis of plantation societies in Spanish America and Portuguese Brazil, and the contesting colonial projects in the Caribbean region, also involving slave plantation labor, of Britain, France, and the Dutch.

The following general questions will guide our analysis and discussion: What is the relationship between institutionalized racism, embedded in the fabric of these societies, and specific \u201cracial eruptions,\u201d which appear to stand in contrast to prevailing ideologies of pluralism and intercultural relations? How to explain the persistence of racial hierarchy in societies where powerful actors explicitly endorse principles of multicultural recognition and racial equality? Does government-endorsed multiculturalism mitigate the negative impact of extractive, industrial, informal and other economic activities on indigenous and afro-descendant peoples? Or alternatively, do these economies actually lay the groundwork for what could be considered a \u201cracialized\u201d economic order? How do the push and pull of migration tied to larger necessities of capital accumulation and labor exploitation shape the dynamics and logics of racism within the region? What types of constitutional reforms, legislative and public policy agendas have emerged to address these dynamics and logics?    DRAP-GA 1048 \u2013 International Studies in Human Rights Day/Time: Monday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: This purpose of this class is to introduce students to international human rights and the movement\u2019s relationship to the field of comprehensive peace education. As an multi-disciplinary field, peace education takes a holistic approach to conflict and education. Essentially, peace education is the creation and transmission of knowledge needed to achieve and maintain peace. It is also about developing the critical and reflective capacities to apply knowledge in order to control, reduce, and eliminate various forms of violence. Using a peace education approach, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related normative global standards will be used as the primary conceptual frameworks to guide our inquiries.    CINE-GT 1155 \u2013 Mexican Cinema Day/Time: Thursday, 12:30pm - 4:30pm Prof. Lauro Zavalla Location: See Albert Course Description: Offering an overview of the main film genres in the history of Mexican cinema, with emphasis on the so-called Golden Age (1945-1954), and the first decade of the 21st century. The course will be focused on identifying the forms of representation of Mexican identity through the study of key film sequences. Considering that most Mexican films are not available with English subtitles, the instructor will project selected fragments of specific films to support the concepts and stimulate the discussion. Also, this seminar will be accompanied with Course Notes produced for this purpose. It is expected that each student will write a 5 to 7 double-spaced essay on any film or group of films studied in the course, emphasizing their historical relevance.

This will provide a basis from which to unravel how state officialization of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multilingual Education involved its depolitization through the fading of its historical critical potential. In this light, we will examine how proponents of such officialization chose to ignore critical pedagogy, critical race theory and most of all the contributions and critiques made by feminists and critical gender theorists of education. The seminar will thus end with the exploration of such feminist critiques and those of indigenous women and men interested in \u201ctroubling\u201d the educational arena and taking the legacies and trajectories of Freirean approaches to education and of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multicultural Education proposals a step further.  LATC-GA 2537 \u2013 Latin American and Caribbean Intellectual History Day/Time: Monday, 12:00pm - 2:30pm Prof. Dylon Robbins Location: 404W KJCC Course Description: In this course, we will explore some of the key texts and ideas in the intellectual history of Latin America and the Caribbean. How have Latin American and Caribbean intellectuals approached the problems of culture and difference? How have they theorized the state, civil society, or the public sphere? How have notions of gender, heterogeneity, race and ethnicity, and nationalism related to their historical contexts? A review of texts including \u00c1ngel Rama, Jean Franco, Gilberto Freyre, Marilena Chaui, Fernando Ortiz, Suely Rolnik, Roberto Schwarz, Jamaica Kincaid, C.L.R. James, Frantz Fanon, Glauber Rocha, Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, and others.

Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures. Students who satisfactorily complete introductory Quechua will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.

Location: KJCC 404W Prof. Jill Lane     Course Description: This course will introduce students to ethnographic methods, offer an overview of different types of ethnography, and reflect critically on the practice of ethnography. Through a series of fieldwork exercises and readings students will learn practical skills related to fieldwork, such as note-taking and interviewing. The course readings will also survey different ethnographic perspectives--such as feminist ethnography, thick description, visual ethnography, and historical ethnography--each of which engenders certain critiques of the limits of qualitative research and empiricism.
