The Jewish Community in Palestine Under Ottoman and British Rule    HBRJD-UA  188 4 points.    The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood. The  War of 1948    HBRJD-UA  189 Offered  every three years. 4 points.    The first Arab-Israeli war of 1948 still provokes multidimensional debates, in both academic and public circles.

For both, it is the formative event of their history.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    One  of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's  uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and  in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception  of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by  the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the  Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance.  Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution.

The Jewish Community in Palestine Under Ottoman and British Rule    HBRJD-UA  188 4 points.    The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood.

For both, it is the formative event of their history. In recent decades, Israel's \"New Historians,\" alongside other researchers, have contributed to changes in the way historians, and even the Israeli public, see their past. We attempt to provide students with basic knowledge and analytical tools to understand what \"really happened,\" beyond narratives and memories.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    One  of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's  uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and  in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception  of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by  the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the  Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance.  Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution.

Students will read secondary sources as well as memoirs, diaries, and letters. Immigration in Israeli Society HBRJD-UA 186 Offered occasionally. 4 points. The main goal of the present course is to emphasize the common denominator, between those who came to Palestine in Early 20th century to those who came the Americas in the same period of time. Therefore some questions to be discussed during the course: How was the decision to emigrate (whether to Palestine or to some other destination country) made? What role did Zionist ideology play in migration to Palestine? What was the profile of the Jewish immigrants to the destination countries? Was the composition of the immigration to Palestine unique? What obstacles did the migrants encounter in acting on their decision and how did they overcome them, if at all? Women in Israeli Society HBRJD-UA 187 Offered occasionally. 4 points. This course studies the role of women in the pre-state and Israeli society from the end of the 19th century until today from historical, sociological and legal perspectives. Topics to be discussed include the myth of gender equality in Ottoman and Mandatory Palestine and later in the state of Israel; images of the \"new Hebrew woman,\" the reality and life of these women, their contributions to the new Israeli society and culture; and the concepts of gender and national identities. The Jewish Community in Palestine under Ottoman and British Rule HBRJD-UA 188 Offered occasionally. 4 points. During the 19th century the small Jewish community of Palestine was primarily a religious community and had no expectations for a status beyond that of a minority within the Ottoman Empire. The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world, nevertheless the Jews were a small minority amongst an Arab majority. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. The course will examine also the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population. The course will also examine the development of the Arab community in Palestine, and its response to the imposition of British rule. The growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to the growth of Jewish society will be discussed, and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood. The War of 1948 HBRJD-UA 189 Offered occasionally. 4 points. The first Arab-Israeli war of 1948 still provokes multidimensional debates, in both academic and public circles.

For both, it is the formative event of their history. In recent decades, Israel's \"New Historians,\" alongside other researchers, have contributed to changes in the way historians, and even the Israeli public, see their past. We attempt to provide students with basic knowledge and analytical tools to understand what \"really happened,\" beyond narratives and memories.
