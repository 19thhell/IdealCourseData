Students who secure an internship through or with the assistance of NYU Washington, DC must confirm their spot in the program and enroll in the internship class in order to accept the internship. Many NYU departments (including SCA &amp; Environmental Studies) allow the Washington, DC internship course to satisfy major requirements. Always consult with your academic adviser to confirm how the internship course and other courses you will take while away fit in with your academic progress towards degree fulfillment. Students are required to pursue a minimum of 10 hours/week in their internships to earn course credit. NYU Washington, DC advises that students pursue no more than 20 hrs/week in internship commitments.

Students are highly encouraged to consult NYU Washington DC staff for assistance with these decisions.

Students who secure an internship through or with the assistance of NYU Washington, DC must confirm their spot in the program and enroll in the internship class in order to accept the internship. Many NYU departments (including SCA &amp; Environmental Studies) allow the Washington, DC internship course to satisfy major requirements. Always consult with your academic adviser to confirm how the internship course and other courses you will take while away fit in with your academic progress towards degree fulfillment. Students are required to pursue a minimum of 10 hours/week in their internships to earn course credit. NYU Washington, DC advises that students pursue no more than 20 hrs/week in internship commitments. If students elect to participate in an internship that exceeds the recommended number of hours, they may be advised to reduce their academic course load. Students are highly encouraged to consult NYU Washington DC staff for assistance with these decisions.   PLEASE NOTE: Internships that take place in Maryland, regardless of whether credit is awarded for the experience, require that your school or department have a certificate of approval to operate in the state.

The degree also features a concentration, in either public relations management or corporate and organizational communication; a practicum project in which you prepare, present, and potentially launch a communication plan that meets a real need for a real organization; and a capstone project, which is a publication-ready thesis paper that makes an original contribution to the field.   The program is designed to meet the needs of both working professionals and full-time students, allowing opportunities for either part-time or full-time study in any semester. It can be completed in two years of full-time study, or in up to five years of part-time study.   The program, though mainly classroom-based, also is making important strides with distance learning, especially with respect to the pedagogical methodologies that will work best in what has been called &quot;The Age of the Conversation.&quot;           Expand All   Collapse All          Core Curriculum        The core curriculum is designed to provide you with a deep and broad foundation that supports concentration coursework and serves you throughout your career. Students are required to take all of the following courses.     Students enrolled prior to fall 2009 may use Social Media: Objectives, Strategies, Tactics as a concentration elective course requirement.

Students who secure an internship through or with the assistance of NYU Washington, DC must confirm their spot in the program and enroll in the internship class in order to accept the internship. Many NYU departments (including SCA &amp; Environmental Studies) allow the Washington, DC internship course to satisfy major requirements. Always consult with your academic adviser to confirm how the internship course and other courses you will take while away fit in with your academic progress towards degree fulfillment. Students are required to pursue a minimum of 10 hours/week in their internships to earn course credit. NYU Washington, DC advises that students pursue no more than 20 hrs/week in internship commitments.

Students are highly encouraged to consult NYU Washington DC staff for assistance with these decisions.

The degree also features a concentration, in either public relations management or corporate and organizational communication; a practicum project in which you prepare, present, and potentially launch a communication plan that meets a real need for a real organization; and a capstone project, which is a publication-ready thesis paper that makes an original contribution to the field.   The program is designed to meet the needs of both working professionals and full-time students, allowing opportunities for either part-time or full-time study in any semester. It can be completed in two years of full-time study, or in up to five years of part-time study.   The program, though mainly classroom-based, also is making important strides with distance learning, especially with respect to the pedagogical methodologies that will work best in what has been called &quot;The Age of the Conversation.&quot;           Expand All   Collapse All          Core Curriculum        The core curriculum is designed to provide you with a deep and broad foundation that supports concentration coursework and serves you throughout your career.
