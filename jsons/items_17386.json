Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.

What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.

Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

In the event you are not contacted, your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for other job opportunities for one year.   In addition to interviews, further screening is conducted for some positions. This may include testing for knowledge of specific software packages or extensive background investigations depending on the type of position.   Should you encounter difficulty in accessing the system or should you require any further assistance, please contact PeopleLink, NYU's new integrated service center for HR, Benefits, and Payroll inquiries, at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .

The Employment Application System is designed to run in a web browser over the Internet. The system supports browser versions of Netscape 4.7 and above and Internet Explorer 4.0 and above. However some of the older browser versions are less powerful than newer versions, so the appearance of certain screens and printed documents may be slightly askew.   The site also requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed. This is a free download available at www.adobe.com .   It is recommended that you do not use your browser's \"Back\", \"Forward\" or \"Refresh\" buttons to navigate the site, or open a new browser window from your existing window. This may cause unexpected results, including loss of data or being logged out of the system. Please use the navigational buttons within the site.

Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.

Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.

Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

Within the application you have the opportunity to &quot;cut and paste&quot; your resume and cover letter or upload your resume into the system.   Once you have completed the online application, you will receive a confirmation message. This verifies your application is now in the system.   Resumes of qualified applicants will become part of our general database for future consideration, and will enable us to review qualifications as positions become available.   If you are contacted by a Human Resources representative, you will be asked to sign the Application for Employment at the time of the interview.   Please note that the application process is competitive. Applications are screened and only those applicants who appear to most closely fit the job requirements will be contacted for interviews. In the event you are not contacted, your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for other job opportunities for one year.   In addition to interviews, further screening is conducted for some positions. This may include testing for knowledge of specific software packages or extensive background investigations depending on the type of position.   Should you encounter difficulty in accessing the system or should you require any further assistance, please contact PeopleLink, NYU's new integrated service center for HR, Benefits, and Payroll inquiries, at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .

Overview       Software continues to pervade our lives and is now routinely  deployed in safety and security critical systems. While this  technological advancement greatly benefits society it also  creates a new threat: software failures with severe  consequences, such as health hazards and financial  repercussions. How can one ensure that software works  reliably? Program Verification is the area of computer  science that studies mathematical methods to answer this  question. In the last decade, Program Verification has brought  forth sophisticated tools that assist software engineers in  building reliable software. In this course, we will explore  these tools. We will learn how they are used to enable  rigorous software development, and we will study the  algorithms that work under their hoods. The course will be  accompanied by programming projects making use of these tools.       Topics        Design by Contract    Semantics of Programming Languages    Runtime Assertion Checking    Automated Test Case Generation    Extended Static Checking    Formal Verification    Static Analysis         Tools        The list of tools that we will discuss in the course includes:         Alloy    JML    JMLUnit    Korat    ESC/Java2         Prerequisites       This course will be open to MS and PhD students. Participants  should have basic understanding of mathematical concepts such  as sets and relations and the ability to write mathematical  proofs. Also, basic programming experience in Java is  assumed. Preliminary knowledge in Logics and Verification is  useful but not mandatory. The course is self-contained and any  required background knowledge is taught in class.

Academic Integrity        Please review   the    departmental academic integrity policy . In this course,   you may discuss homework problems and assignments with other   students, but the work you turn in must be your own. Do not   copy another student's work. Also, you should consult the   instructor before using materials or code other than that   provided in class. Copying code or other work without giving   appropriate acknowledgment is a serious offense with   consequences ranging from no credit to potential expulsion.

Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.

Overview       Software continues to pervade our lives and is now routinely  deployed in safety and security critical systems. While this  technological advancement greatly benefits society it also  creates a new threat: software failures with severe  consequences, such as health hazards and financial  repercussions. How can one ensure that software works  reliably? Program Verification is the area of computer  science that studies mathematical methods to answer this  question. In the last decade, Program Verification has brought  forth sophisticated tools that assist software engineers in  building reliable software. In this course, we will explore  these tools. We will learn how they are used to enable  rigorous software development, and we will study the  algorithms that work under their hoods. The course will be  accompanied by programming projects making use of these tools.
