Variously known as the I, the self, the persona (performed or feigned) or the identity we make or somehow possess, subjectivity as a subject suits writing because it is never fixed. Concern for the self is not, however, a self-centered pursuit. It has served as a medium through which readers and writers have been able to live deeply as historical agents and spiritual beings. Respect for self has flourished since antiquity. The ancients thought self-knowledge was fundamental to everything else, and conscientiousness is understood today as a cornerstone of citizenship. In this seminar we will acquaint ourselves with some landmark texts in the history of the mutable I, observing many artful variations made by key writers in the tradition of reflective autobiography. We will learn how to read these predecessors by moving with their rhythms or by accompanying them in cinematic time. Readings and visual materials have been chosen to be fun, challenging and various. They provide a selective foundation for what might be called the tradition of the individual person as he or she comes to self-awareness. Our readings serve as occasions for written imitation, reflection and improvisation. We will also rely on them as touchstones for our own writing practice.           While readings and films about the self often operate through closeness and disclosure, the best of them are also philosophical and scientific, thereby supporting our balanced objective of working reflectively and working interpretively. Our writing projects will span a variety of positions between a greater self beyond our own selfs mere self (what the poet Paul Valry once called some self miraculously superior to Myself ), and a more distanced assessment of selected, constructed selves from history and literary history.           Some of our readings are already known to us faintly, thanks to the diligent passivity of our cultural subconscious: Augustines Confessions, the first book of Prousts multi-volume oeuvre , Swanns Way ; Nella Larsens slender masterpiece from the Harlem Renaissance period, Passing; literary innovations by modern masters such as Luigi Pirandello, J.L. Borges, Natalia Ginzburg, and John Barth; and thoughtful analyses of performed and counterfeited selves by Judith Butler and R.D. Laing. Beguiling cinematic visions of erased, unreal, elusive, split, vague and plural selves come to us through Bernardo Bertolucci, Ingmar Bergman and Luis Buuel and in Stan Brakhages cinematic adventures into our inner, psychic life.

EXPOS-UA 15 A Spectrum of Essays: Reconceiving Artfulness and its Risks           Credits: 4 Instructor: Bruce Bromley, EWP Prequisite: Portfolio review           At the height of her fame as a mind that reimagines what essays and novels can do, Virginia Woolf presses her fellow makers and readers to consider that every moment is the centre and meeting place of an extraordinary number of perceptions which have not yet been expressed, showing us how life is always and inevitably much richer than we who try to express it. Like Woolf and her contemporaries, we belong to a world where feelings which used to come simple and separate do so no longer, where beauty is part ugliness; amusement part disgust; pleasure part pain. Emotions which used to enter the mind whole are now broken up on the threshold. These claims mean that we need to reconceive the very notion of threshold, along with the forms by which makers, in the disciplines available to us, structure the experience of living in relation to any boundary. How we ponder artfulness, Woolf implies, requires expansion, as so many influences which play . . . a large part in life have thus far escaped the novelist and her colleaguesamong them,the power of music, the stimulus of light, the effect on us of the shape of trees or the play of colour. To re-see the shapes whereby we express our contact with life will blur the boundaries between customarily separate art forms, Woolf implies, and involve us in the risks inherent in any attempt to make over, to make again, to make anew. What can the risks in play here teach us? At the service of contemplating that question, we will read work by Jennifer Egan, Rainer Maria Rilke, W.G. Sebald, and Woolf herself. We will listen to music that rethinks what sound, ordered into patterns, can make manifest. We will watch films by Pedro Almodvar, Fran&#1195;ois Ozon, Grant Gee, and Fran&#1195;ois Girard. And we will work at crafting essays that honor our attempts to amplify what shaped thinking can communicate. By November 8, 2014, please email Bruce Bromley at bdb2@nyu.edu to inquire how to submit what you think of as your finest essay, which will function as your portfolio review. Notice of selection will occur within eight days of your first contact.

Variously known as the I, the self, the persona (performed or feigned) or the identity we make or somehow possess, subjectivity as a subject suits writing because it is never fixed. Concern for the self is not, however, a self-centered pursuit. It has served as a medium through which readers and writers have been able to live deeply as historical agents and spiritual beings. Respect for self has flourished since antiquity. The ancients thought self-knowledge was fundamental to everything else, and conscientiousness is understood today as a cornerstone of citizenship. In this seminar we will acquaint ourselves with some landmark texts in the history of the mutable I, observing many artful variations made by key writers in the tradition of reflective autobiography. We will learn how to read these predecessors by moving with their rhythms or by accompanying them in cinematic time. Readings and visual materials have been chosen to be fun, challenging and various. They provide a selective foundation for what might be called the tradition of the individual person as he or she comes to self-awareness. Our readings serve as occasions for written imitation, reflection and improvisation. We will also rely on them as touchstones for our own writing practice.           While readings and films about the self often operate through closeness and disclosure, the best of them are also philosophical and scientific, thereby supporting our balanced objective of working reflectively and working interpretively. Our writing projects will span a variety of positions between a greater self beyond our own selfs mere self (what the poet Paul Valry once called some self miraculously superior to Myself ), and a more distanced assessment of selected, constructed selves from history and literary history.           Some of our readings are already known to us faintly, thanks to the diligent passivity of our cultural subconscious: Augustines Confessions, the first book of Prousts multi-volume oeuvre , Swanns Way ; Nella Larsens slender masterpiece from the Harlem Renaissance period, Passing; literary innovations by modern masters such as Luigi Pirandello, J.L. Borges, Natalia Ginzburg, and John Barth; and thoughtful analyses of performed and counterfeited selves by Judith Butler and R.D. Laing. Beguiling cinematic visions of erased, unreal, elusive, split, vague and plural selves come to us through Bernardo Bertolucci, Ingmar Bergman and Luis Buuel and in Stan Brakhages cinematic adventures into our inner, psychic life.

EXPOS-UA 15 A Spectrum of Essays: Reconceiving Artfulness and its Risks           Credits: 4 Instructor: Bruce Bromley, EWP Prequisite: Portfolio review           At the height of her fame as a mind that reimagines what essays and novels can do, Virginia Woolf presses her fellow makers and readers to consider that every moment is the centre and meeting place of an extraordinary number of perceptions which have not yet been expressed, showing us how life is always and inevitably much richer than we who try to express it. Like Woolf and her contemporaries, we belong to a world where feelings which used to come simple and separate do so no longer, where beauty is part ugliness; amusement part disgust; pleasure part pain. Emotions which used to enter the mind whole are now broken up on the threshold. These claims mean that we need to reconceive the very notion of threshold, along with the forms by which makers, in the disciplines available to us, structure the experience of living in relation to any boundary. How we ponder artfulness, Woolf implies, requires expansion, as so many influences which play . . . a large part in life have thus far escaped the novelist and her colleaguesamong them,the power of music, the stimulus of light, the effect on us of the shape of trees or the play of colour. To re-see the shapes whereby we express our contact with life will blur the boundaries between customarily separate art forms, Woolf implies, and involve us in the risks inherent in any attempt to make over, to make again, to make anew. What can the risks in play here teach us? At the service of contemplating that question, we will read work by Jennifer Egan, Rainer Maria Rilke, W.G. Sebald, and Woolf herself. We will listen to music that rethinks what sound, ordered into patterns, can make manifest. We will watch films by Pedro Almodvar, Fran&#1195;ois Ozon, Grant Gee, and Fran&#1195;ois Girard. And we will work at crafting essays that honor our attempts to amplify what shaped thinking can communicate.

Writing provides students with an important method for organizing and expressing their thoughts, and it helps them develop and enhance their critical, analytical, and interpretive skills. The two-semester Writing sequence advances the global emphasis of LS by engaging students in reading, analyzing, and interpreting works throughout the English-speaking world and, in translation, beyond it; in the classroom, instructors deal with the attendant issues of geography, political and social difference, and translation. Students also produce original work based on research and the incorporation of dialogue with other writers and thinkers. Writing I Writing I has two main objectives. The first is to develop self-confidence and fluency through the use of writing to express, explore, and develop ideas through a variety of modes, including informal writing (free writing, journal writing, etc.). The second objective is to practice the critical and analytical skills students will use throughout their undergraduate career. All papers go through multiple drafts, often with input from peers in addition to the instructor. Writing II In Writing II, students develop their skills in analysis and argumentation by exploring the ways in which the ideas of others can be incorporated into their own writing. Students read and discuss longer, more challenging texts and are expected to incorporate a broad range of primary and secondary sources to develop and support increasingly complex ideas. Students are introduced to a wide variety of potential resources at the library and learn the mechanics and conventions of the academic research essay. The course continues to encourage in-class participation, collaborative learning, and workshop presentations.

Writing provides students with an important method for organizing and expressing their thoughts, and it helps them develop and enhance their critical, analytical, and interpretive skills. The two-semester Writing sequence advances the global emphasis of LS by engaging students in reading, analyzing, and interpreting works throughout the English-speaking world and, in translation, beyond it; in the classroom, instructors deal with the attendant issues of geography, political and social difference, and translation. Students also produce original work based on research and the incorporation of dialogue with other writers and thinkers. Writing I Writing I has two main objectives. The first is to develop self-confidence and fluency through the use of writing to express, explore, and develop ideas through a variety of modes, including informal writing (free writing, journal writing, etc.). The second objective is to practice the critical and analytical skills students will use throughout their undergraduate career. All papers go through multiple drafts, often with input from peers in addition to the instructor. Writing II In Writing II, students develop their skills in analysis and argumentation by exploring the ways in which the ideas of others can be incorporated into their own writing. Students read and discuss longer, more challenging texts and are expected to incorporate a broad range of primary and secondary sources to develop and support increasingly complex ideas. Students are introduced to a wide variety of potential resources at the library and learn the mechanics and conventions of the academic research essay. The course continues to encourage in-class participation, collaborative learning, and workshop presentations.
