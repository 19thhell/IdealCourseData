Program Description    The NYU Dietetic Internship is a full-time program that requires enrollment in three NYU semesters or two semesters and a summer session, which is about 13 months total. The program includes one full semester of coursework (academic component), followed by 27 weeks of supervised practice (on-site component) for a total of 1200 full-time, supervised hours.    First Semester    Interns must complete five graduate courses (12 credits) before entering supervised clinical practice. You must receive a B or better on each required internship course in order to be placed in the 27-week supervised practice component.    These courses are:    NUTR-GE 2000.02  New Graduate Student Seminar: Nutrition Section (0) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2190.01  Research Methods (3) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2037    Medical Nutrition Therapy (4) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2037.002  Medical Nutrition Therapy Recitation NUTR-GE 2196    Nutrition-Focused Physical Assessment (2) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2198    Nutrition Counseling Theory &amp; Practice (3) (F, Sp)    Note: No master's level (NUTR-GE 2xxx) courses may be taken pass/fail.
