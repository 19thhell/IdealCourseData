This 42-credit full- or part-time degree program consists of a sequence of core courses, the choice of a concentration in one of four areas of professional expertise, and two capstone courses.   Before the start of formal classes, Tisch Center students participate in a one-week intensive industry orientation to learn about NYU policies and procedures, to meet faculty members and alumni who offer perspectives on sports business, and to explore concepts of critical thinking through workshops. Students participate in an overview of basic economic, accounting, and finance principles and concepts to set the foundation upon which in-depth economic, accounting, and finance theory rests.   The general core, comprised of seven courses, explores key aspects of the industry, including legal issues, sports economics, finance and development, and planning and execution of major sporting events.   While core courses provide a broad overview of the industry, concentrations allow you to investigate the area of greatest interest to you. After completing the core courses, you may specialize in one of four concentrations: professional and collegiate sports operations, sports marketing and sales, global sports media, or sports law. Each concentration offers an internship course, which provides you with industry experience or the opportunity to expand your experience into another area of the field.   Electives are optional courses that allow for individual investigation of specialized topics. Electives include a Seminar in Sports Law , an Advanced Special Project, which is an individually applied research initiative, Independent Study in Sports , and an additional internship.   If you have relevant work experience, you may be eligible to waive a core or concentration course with departmental approval. Waivers permit you to take additional courses in selected areas; they do not reduce the number of credits required for the degree.
