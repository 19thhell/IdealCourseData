About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

Its philosophical roots can be found in the school of behaviorism which states that psychological matters can be studied scientifically by observing overt behavior, without discussing internal mental states. Classical conditioning (often associated with the work of Pavlov) is another important feature of behavior therapy. As a result of experience, or associative learning, individuals often respond in predictable ways to certain stimuli or life events which may no longer be appropriate. These techniques follow from the premise that maladaptive behaviors are learned, and therefore can be unlearned as well. Among the behavioral techniques employed are training in both assertiveness and relaxation, and gradual desensitization to feared objects.      Return To Top      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy(CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach comprised of both cognitive and behavioral techniques. The premise underlying a cognitive-behavioral orientation is that difficulties in living, relationships, general health, etc., have their origin in (and are maintained by) both cognitive and behavioral factors. CBT aims to influence problematic and dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and cognitions through a goal-oriented, systematic procedure. CBT is often brief and time-limited and is used in individual therapy as well as group settings.      Return To Top      Cognitive Therapy essentially involves helping an individual think in more effective ways and aims to uncover the irrational and problematic thinking styles that often accompany psychological distress. The goal of cognitive intervention is to challenge, and ultimately change, maladaptive, self-defeating cognitions, and allow the client to lead a more productive and satisfying life. Simple to learn cognitive strategies provide clients with practical and powerful skills that can be applied over a lifetime as effective tools in life-management.      Return To Top      Group Psychotherapy or group therapy is a form of psychotherapy which one or more therapists treat a small group of clients together as a group. In group psychotherapy the group context and group process is explicitly utilized as a mechanism of change by developing, exploring and examining interpersonal relationships within the group.      Return To Top      Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) , also known as electroshock , is most often used as a treatment for severe major depression which has not responded to other treatment, and is also used in the treatment of mania, catatonia, schizophrenia and other disorders. Treatment can be either on an inpatient or outpatient basis and usually in a course of 6-12 treatments administered 2 or 3 times a week. After treatment, drug therapy can be continued, and some patients receive continuation/maintenance ECT. Certain types of ECT have been shown to cause persistent memory loss, whereas confusion usually clears within hours of treatment.      Return To Top      Individual Psychotherapy see Psychotherapy      Inpatient Services is the care of patients whose condition requires hospitalization. Progress in modern medicine and the advent of comprehensive out patient programs ensure that patients are only admitted to a hospital when they are extremely ill.      Return To Top      Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) offers psychiatric evaluation and psychotherapeutic treatment enhanced by techniques derived from a psychotherapy model developed by Habib Davanloo, MD. ISTDP's primary goal is to help the patient overcome internal resistance to experiencing true feelings about the present and past which have been warded off because they are either too frightening or too painful. The technique is intensive in that it aims to help the patient experience these warded-off feelings to the maximum degree possible; it is short-term in that it tries to achieve this experience as quickly as possible; it is dynamic because it involves working with unconscious forces and transference feelings.      Return To Top      Pharmacotherapy is the treatment of mental illness or mental disorders with medication. This type of treatment can be combined with psychotherapy and can also stand alone.      Return To Top      Psychiatric Evaluation is an examination or assessment of the mental health of an individual and is the mental equivalent of a physical examination. A psychological evaluation may result in a diagnosis of a mental illness or disorder.      Return To Top      Psychoanalytic Treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of underlying sources of his or her difficulties, not just intellectually, but emotionally by re-experiencing them with the analyst, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the patient\u2019s life.      Return To Top      Psychotherapy or Individual Psychotherapy is an interpersonal relational intervention used by psychotherapists to help individuals, couples, families or groups in problems of living. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change that are designed to improve the mental health of the individual or to improve group relationships. Psychotherapy may be performed by practitioners with a number of different qualifications, including psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, psychiatric nurses, music therapists and creative arts therapists.Typically, the patient comes four or five times a week, lies on a couch, and attempts to say everything that comes to mind.

About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening.

Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening.

Its philosophical roots can be found in the school of behaviorism which states that psychological matters can be studied scientifically by observing overt behavior, without discussing internal mental states. Classical conditioning (often associated with the work of Pavlov) is another important feature of behavior therapy. As a result of experience, or associative learning, individuals often respond in predictable ways to certain stimuli or life events which may no longer be appropriate. These techniques follow from the premise that maladaptive behaviors are learned, and therefore can be unlearned as well. Among the behavioral techniques employed are training in both assertiveness and relaxation, and gradual desensitization to feared objects.      Return To Top      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy(CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach comprised of both cognitive and behavioral techniques. The premise underlying a cognitive-behavioral orientation is that difficulties in living, relationships, general health, etc., have their origin in (and are maintained by) both cognitive and behavioral factors. CBT aims to influence problematic and dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and cognitions through a goal-oriented, systematic procedure. CBT is often brief and time-limited and is used in individual therapy as well as group settings.      Return To Top      Cognitive Therapy essentially involves helping an individual think in more effective ways and aims to uncover the irrational and problematic thinking styles that often accompany psychological distress. The goal of cognitive intervention is to challenge, and ultimately change, maladaptive, self-defeating cognitions, and allow the client to lead a more productive and satisfying life. Simple to learn cognitive strategies provide clients with practical and powerful skills that can be applied over a lifetime as effective tools in life-management.      Return To Top      Group Psychotherapy or group therapy is a form of psychotherapy which one or more therapists treat a small group of clients together as a group. In group psychotherapy the group context and group process is explicitly utilized as a mechanism of change by developing, exploring and examining interpersonal relationships within the group.      Return To Top      Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) , also known as electroshock , is most often used as a treatment for severe major depression which has not responded to other treatment, and is also used in the treatment of mania, catatonia, schizophrenia and other disorders. Treatment can be either on an inpatient or outpatient basis and usually in a course of 6-12 treatments administered 2 or 3 times a week. After treatment, drug therapy can be continued, and some patients receive continuation/maintenance ECT. Certain types of ECT have been shown to cause persistent memory loss, whereas confusion usually clears within hours of treatment.      Return To Top      Individual Psychotherapy see Psychotherapy      Inpatient Services is the care of patients whose condition requires hospitalization. Progress in modern medicine and the advent of comprehensive out patient programs ensure that patients are only admitted to a hospital when they are extremely ill.      Return To Top      Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) offers psychiatric evaluation and psychotherapeutic treatment enhanced by techniques derived from a psychotherapy model developed by Habib Davanloo, MD. ISTDP's primary goal is to help the patient overcome internal resistance to experiencing true feelings about the present and past which have been warded off because they are either too frightening or too painful. The technique is intensive in that it aims to help the patient experience these warded-off feelings to the maximum degree possible; it is short-term in that it tries to achieve this experience as quickly as possible; it is dynamic because it involves working with unconscious forces and transference feelings.      Return To Top      Pharmacotherapy is the treatment of mental illness or mental disorders with medication. This type of treatment can be combined with psychotherapy and can also stand alone.      Return To Top      Psychiatric Evaluation is an examination or assessment of the mental health of an individual and is the mental equivalent of a physical examination. A psychological evaluation may result in a diagnosis of a mental illness or disorder.      Return To Top      Psychoanalytic Treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of underlying sources of his or her difficulties, not just intellectually, but emotionally by re-experiencing them with the analyst, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the patient\u2019s life.      Return To Top      Psychotherapy or Individual Psychotherapy is an interpersonal relational intervention used by psychotherapists to help individuals, couples, families or groups in problems of living. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change that are designed to improve the mental health of the individual or to improve group relationships. Psychotherapy may be performed by practitioners with a number of different qualifications, including psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, psychiatric nurses, music therapists and creative arts therapists.Typically, the patient comes four or five times a week, lies on a couch, and attempts to say everything that comes to mind.
