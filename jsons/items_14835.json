NOTE: I'm not available Thursday, December 11. I will be available Monday, December 15, 1-4pm. I am also reachable by email.    Announcements    Final exam        The final exam is scheduled for Tuesday, December 16, 8:00-9:50, in our regular class room.    The exam covers class sessions, class notes, and readings from the midterm onwards (that is, starting with \u201cpublic information\u201d).    You\u2019re responsible for all concepts and terms from these sessions, notes and readings, but the most important things are mentioned in the class sessions and notes.    The exam will be 110 minutes, closed book, closed notes. The format will be part multiple choice and part short answer. Bring a calculator.    Packet of sample questions .       RIT assignment (dynamic hedging). The RIT H3 case will be running on the server until 9am Thursday, December 4. The case involves designing and implementing a hedge on a short call option position. Support materials include the RIT H3 case brief , the spreadsheet Black-Scholes.xlsx and the class notes from Thursday, November 20. An earlier version of the class notes had a typo: the underlying is 20,000 shares of stock (not 200,000).    In this exercise, your firm has just sold call options.Your job is to hedge this short position. The fair value of the call is 0.84 per share; the firm has just sold them at 1.41 per share (so you've made an immediate profit of 20,000 x (1.41-0.84) = $11,400. By hedging, you can hold on to this profit. If the position were perfectly hedged, you'd have a final profit of $11,400 (less trading costs). If the position is not perfectly hedged, you might have a profit of more or less than $11,400 - but this involves taking on risk. You will be scored on how closely you've hedged (a good thing), but you'll be penalized for trading costs (a bad thing).    In order to implement the hedge, you'll need to compute the correct number of shares that you should be holding at each stock price. The stock price starts at $50, but will change over the next five minutes. When the stock price changes, you'll need to adjust your hedge. The market is configured to be very liquid. You should be able to implement the hedge using market orders.    A written summary of your calculations and table (SAC price vs. number of shares held) should be turned in, in class on Tuesday, December 2. You may do the written summary in a group, but each person in the group must trade individually.    You will have several opportunities to play this game. On Monday evening (December 1), I'll email your scores for all runs played up to 12pm on Monday. You'll then have the opportunity (through 9am Thursday) to play more rounds, if you need to (or would like to) bring your score up.    RIT assignment (static hedging) . Until 5pm Saturday, November 22 , the H1 case will be looping on the jhasbrou.stern.nyu.edu server. The case involves designing and implementing a market hedge on a $100 Million portfolio.       Estimate the portfolio beta and determine how many contracts you need to short. Prepare a written summary of your calculations, to be turned in, in class on Tuesday, November 25 . (You may work in a group on this part, turning in one paper with all the group names.)    Implement the hedge. Each person should play at least two rounds of the H1 game. Try to establish the hedge quickly. (This reduces your risk exposure.) Try to use limit orders instead of market orders. (This reduces your implementation cost.)       Support materials include : The RIT H1 Case brief , spreadsheet H1.xlsx , and the class notes from Tuesday, November 18. You can practice using one of the guest accounts (guest1-guest20, password:anon). You can also practice using your own account. I'll only score rounds in which you do something in the first 30 seconds of the game (like a trade or a limit order).    RIT assignment . From noon, Thursday, November 13 through noon, Monday, November 17, The server is looping over the F1 stock index futures trading exercise. The question here is: how do we make profits by trading on news announcements? The general answer is: trade before others do. The simulation is driven by random news announcements (which will change in each round of play). The anonymous automated traders will react to the news - but slowly. Your job is to anticipate their reaction to the news and trade ahead of them. There are all kinds of news announcements: positive and negative, significant and insignificant. You can go long up to twenty contracts and short up to twenty contracts. Each round lasts for eight minutes. As always, you can use market or limit orders. There is, however, a commission charge ($2.50 per contract). Play at least two rounds (they don't have to be right after each other). If you play more than two rounds, I'll base the scoring on the last two rounds. In playing this game, I've found it useful to have open on my desktop: the book trader panel, the chart panel (a real-time graphic display), and the portfolio panel to track my P&amp;L (profits and losses). The RIT case notes are posted here .    The FX fix . A number of financial regulators and banks have reached legal settlements regarding bank conduct in the FX market. In the November 13 class I discussed the issues ( class handouts ). The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has posted an announcement to http://www.fca.org.uk/news/fca-fines-five-banks-for-fx-failings . If you scroll down in the announcement, they've posted links to materials and some very nice videos that that explain how the fix and manipulation work. They've posted a separate video for each of the five banks (Citi, RBS, JPMorgan, UBS and HSBC). The direct link to Citi's is http://play.buto.tv/Z9kkQ (or you can go via the FCA link, above). The US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has posted its press release to http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7056-14#PrRoWMBL .    RIT assignment. On Thursday, November 6, we'll be playing the RIT price discovery game PD0. Bring your own (or a borrowed) windows laptop computer. The price discovery game, PD0, is up and running in a loop on the RIT server jhasbrou.stern.nyu.edu. You can play anytime for practice. We'll be running several sessions in Thursday's class. See the original case write-up for the PD0 game ; an excel spreadsheet that illustrates the probability calculations ; and, the class overheads outlining the game . If and when you play for practice before Thursday's class:       There are five stocks being traded (ART, BEV, CAT, DON and EMA). You'll see a row for each of them in the Portfolio panel, but you'll only be able to trade one of them (the one you'll get information for).    The private information will be sent to you in the &quot;News&quot; panel. So keep this open. (We didn't use this panel in the LT1 games.)    The &quot;real&quot; PD0 game will run for 4 minutes, and you'll get new &quot;private information&quot; every 60 seconds. The practice rounds run for two minutes, and you'll get new information every 30 seconds. (The server plays PD0 for two minutes and then waits for one minute.) In addition to your real account (with your userid and password),    I've set up 20 anonymous practice accounts. The Trader IDs for these accounts are guest1, guest2, ... guest20. The password (for all guest accounts) is &quot;anon&quot;. You can practice using your real account, or you can use one of the guest accounts. The guest accounts don't have to be exclusive to this class; if you have friends at Stern who are curious about RIT, they are welcome to play as well.       RIT assignment . The RIT server (at jhasbrou.stern.nyu.edu) is looping over a modified version of the LT1 (&quot;liability trader&quot;) case. Play at least once before 12 pm on Monday, November 3. See notes for the new LT1 case .    Key dates: TAQ Part III (Thursday, 10/16); Midterm (Tuesday, 10/21). The TAQ exercise write-up has been updated to include Part III.    Class on Thursday, October 16 was devoted to midterm review. You can download the marked overheads . A packet of sample midterm problems was distributed in class on Thursday (10/9). You can also download it here . The midterm will be a combination of multiple choice and short answer. Roughly 2/3 will be very similar to the problems in the sample packet. The remaining 1/3 will be more general, and may refer to readings and/or class note material that is not explicitly covered in the sample packet.    Starting with the September 23 class, video recording is enabled. The links are automatically posted to the class page in NYU CLASSES .    Coming up: For class on Thursday September 25, please bring a Windows, wifi-enabled laptop. We won't be running a full-scale trading exercise, but I will cover the basics of the Rotman Interactive Trader (RIT). The next trading game will be an in-class exercise, on October 2. Between Thursday September 25 and October 2, I'll leave the game running on the server, so you can practice.    See the notes on local (Stern) usage of RIT .    Description    Most finance courses focus on how securities are defined, valued and used.    This course is about how securities are traded : the design, operation    and regulation of trading processes, mechanisms and protocols. Today&#39;s markets    for stocks, bonds, and derivatives span a wide range in sophistication and    complexity. For some securities, the market has evolved to an integrated network    that offers very high levels of access and transparency. At the other exteme we    have markets that operate as small dealer networks sustained by reputation and    relationship. Some mechanisms are new (the open electronic limit order book);    some are as old as antiquity (the single-price call auction). We have a general    sense that all markets are heading toward some sort of electronic future, but    the speed of progress and convergence varies widely. Our markets are infused    with tensions between efficiency and fairness, competition and regulation,    consolidation and fragmentation, speed and stability, and so on.    The course is based on a realistic picture of the trading process, so we go   into a fair amount of insitutional detail, as well as some law and market   regulation. The intellectual framework for the material comes from mainstream   economics, financial economics, and the newer subfield of financial economics   known as market microstructure.     The course is aimed at people who are working for (or plan careers in)    securities exchanges, securities trading, or trading support IT.     The course covers general features trading strategies and algorithms.    The goal here is determining how to implement our hedging and portfolio    strategies in some optimal (cheap and effective) manner. It is not about    developing trading strategies that are profitable in and of themselves. It    will not teach you how to become a day trader or high-frequency trader. In    fact, I hope that you come away with a better sense of the substantial    barriers to long-term success in these activities.     This course is   an expanded version of the half-semester MBA course FINC-GB.3149. Click    here for the most recent syllabus to the MBA course.       Workload and deliverables    The course requirements will involve a mix of midterm and final exams, one or more data analysis projects,   short written assignments, and participation in trading exercises. Some of the   trading exercises are involve face-to-face non-automated trading: I usually set   up a floor market in Kryptonite futures contracts. Most present day trading   takes place on computers, though, and so too are most of the exercises.   It is very important that you have a Windows laptop computer that you can bring   to class. (Some of the software simply doesn&#39;t run on Mac OS.)   One piece of software that we&#39;re presently using is the Rotman Interactive   Trader. If you&#39;re curious, there&#39;s a demo page where you can download the   software and play with it ( http://rit.rotman.utoronto.ca/ )   School and departmental grading standards       At NYU Stern, we strive to create courses that challenge students intellectually and that meet the Stern standards of academic excellence. To ensure fairness and clarity of grading, the Stern faculty have agreed that for elective courses the individual instructor or department is responsible for determining reasonable grading guidelines.    The Finance Department has elected to use the following grading guidelines for this course and all other elective courses. Instructors should award grades of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cA-\u201d to approximately 35% of students in elective courses with enrollments of more than 25 students. In elective classes of less than 25 students, the instructor is at liberty to give whatever grades they think the students deserve, while maintaining rigorous academic standards.       Other policies    NYU/Stern policies on Academic Integrity, General Conduct &amp; Behavior, Students with Disabilities, and related matters are posted at http://www.stern.nyu.edu/portal-partners/current-students/undergraduate/resources-policies/academic-policies/ . Unless otherwise stated, these should also be considered policies for this course.    Readings        The principal text for the course is my set of teaching notes    Securities Trading:   Principles and Protocols (STPP) . Note: these notes are in a constant state    of revision, and chapter references given below may change.     Other useful material can be found off my     SDFM links and sources page .

The &quot;real&quot; PD0 game will run for 4 minutes, and you'll get new &quot;private information&quot; every 60 seconds. The practice rounds run for two minutes, and you'll get new information every 30 seconds. (The server plays PD0 for two minutes and then waits for one minute.) In addition to your real account (with your userid and password),    I've set up 20 anonymous practice accounts. The Trader IDs for these accounts are guest1, guest2, ... guest20. The password (for all guest accounts) is &quot;anon&quot;. You can practice using your real account, or you can use one of the guest accounts. The guest accounts don't have to be exclusive to this class; if you have friends at Stern who are curious about RIT, they are welcome to play as well.       RIT assignment . The RIT server (at jhasbrou.stern.nyu.edu) is looping over a modified version of the LT1 (&quot;liability trader&quot;) case. Play at least once before 12 pm on Monday, November 3. See notes for the new LT1 case .    Key dates: TAQ Part III (Thursday, 10/16); Midterm (Tuesday, 10/21). The TAQ exercise write-up has been updated to include Part III.    Class on Thursday, October 16 was devoted to midterm review. You can download the marked overheads . A packet of sample midterm problems was distributed in class on Thursday (10/9). You can also download it here . The midterm will be a combination of multiple choice and short answer. Roughly 2/3 will be very similar to the problems in the sample packet. The remaining 1/3 will be more general, and may refer to readings and/or class note material that is not explicitly covered in the sample packet.    Starting with the September 23 class, video recording is enabled. The links are automatically posted to the class page in NYU CLASSES .    Coming up: For class on Thursday September 25, please bring a Windows, wifi-enabled laptop. We won't be running a full-scale trading exercise, but I will cover the basics of the Rotman Interactive Trader (RIT). The next trading game will be an in-class exercise, on October 2. Between Thursday September 25 and October 2, I'll leave the game running on the server, so you can practice.    See the notes on local (Stern) usage of RIT .    Description    Most finance courses focus on how securities are defined, valued and used.    This course is about how securities are traded : the design, operation    and regulation of trading processes, mechanisms and protocols. Today&#39;s markets    for stocks, bonds, and derivatives span a wide range in sophistication and    complexity. For some securities, the market has evolved to an integrated network    that offers very high levels of access and transparency. At the other exteme we    have markets that operate as small dealer networks sustained by reputation and    relationship. Some mechanisms are new (the open electronic limit order book);    some are as old as antiquity (the single-price call auction). We have a general    sense that all markets are heading toward some sort of electronic future, but    the speed of progress and convergence varies widely. Our markets are infused    with tensions between efficiency and fairness, competition and regulation,    consolidation and fragmentation, speed and stability, and so on.    The course is based on a realistic picture of the trading process, so we go   into a fair amount of insitutional detail, as well as some law and market   regulation. The intellectual framework for the material comes from mainstream   economics, financial economics, and the newer subfield of financial economics   known as market microstructure.     The course is aimed at people who are working for (or plan careers in)    securities exchanges, securities trading, or trading support IT.     The course covers general features trading strategies and algorithms.    The goal here is determining how to implement our hedging and portfolio    strategies in some optimal (cheap and effective) manner. It is not about    developing trading strategies that are profitable in and of themselves. It    will not teach you how to become a day trader or high-frequency trader. In    fact, I hope that you come away with a better sense of the substantial    barriers to long-term success in these activities.     This course is   an expanded version of the half-semester MBA course FINC-GB.3149. Click    here for the most recent syllabus to the MBA course.       Workload and deliverables    The course requirements will involve a mix of midterm and final exams, one or more data analysis projects,   short written assignments, and participation in trading exercises. Some of the   trading exercises are involve face-to-face non-automated trading: I usually set   up a floor market in Kryptonite futures contracts. Most present day trading   takes place on computers, though, and so too are most of the exercises.   It is very important that you have a Windows laptop computer that you can bring   to class. (Some of the software simply doesn&#39;t run on Mac OS.)   One piece of software that we&#39;re presently using is the Rotman Interactive   Trader. If you&#39;re curious, there&#39;s a demo page where you can download the   software and play with it ( http://rit.rotman.utoronto.ca/ )   School and departmental grading standards       At NYU Stern, we strive to create courses that challenge students intellectually and that meet the Stern standards of academic excellence. To ensure fairness and clarity of grading, the Stern faculty have agreed that for elective courses the individual instructor or department is responsible for determining reasonable grading guidelines.    The Finance Department has elected to use the following grading guidelines for this course and all other elective courses. Instructors should award grades of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cA-\u201d to approximately 35% of students in elective courses with enrollments of more than 25 students. In elective classes of less than 25 students, the instructor is at liberty to give whatever grades they think the students deserve, while maintaining rigorous academic standards.       Other policies    NYU/Stern policies on Academic Integrity, General Conduct &amp; Behavior, Students with Disabilities, and related matters are posted at http://www.stern.nyu.edu/portal-partners/current-students/undergraduate/resources-policies/academic-policies/ . Unless otherwise stated, these should also be considered policies for this course.    Readings        The principal text for the course is my set of teaching notes    Securities Trading:   Principles and Protocols (STPP) . Note: these notes are in a constant state    of revision, and chapter references given below may change.     Other useful material can be found off my     SDFM links and sources page .
