To what extent are these gendered distinctions also seen in diverse ethnic groups? How are they expressed? In this study, gender role beliefs and values of African-American (AA), Dominican-American (DA), and Mexican-American (MA) mothers were examined using qualitative methods. What gender role beliefs and expectations do AA, DA, and MA mothers hold for their children? Participants included 5 AA, 6 DA, and 7 MA mothers whose children were between 8 months and 2 years of age. Mothers of boys and mothers of girls were asked a series of open-ended questions about their experiences in raising their children. Their responses were transcribed and analyzed for thematic content. 12 themes emerged from the interviews, and were divided into three broad categories: child characteristics, parenting, and other gender domains. These themes were expressed by mothers of all three ethnicities. Themes for child characteristics were 1) Compliance vs. Defiance, 2) Gentleness vs. Roughness, 3) Emotional Sensitivity vs. Emotional Stoicism, and 4) Attachment vs. Independence. Themes for parenting were 5) Mother Role vs. Father Role, 6) Soft Hands vs. Harsh Forms of Discipline, 7) Educational Hopes vs. Educational Fears, and 8) Protection. Themes expressed in other areas included gendered beliefs about Appearance, Activities, and Status/Values. Knowledge of gender role beliefs can help provide a better understanding of parents&rsquo; behavior and their socio-culturally specific ways of socializing gender with their children.       Jessica Burdick Evaluating the Iowa Gambling Task as a Direct Assessment of Impulsivity with Elementary School-Aged Children       The goal of this study is to evaluate the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson, 1994) as a direct assessment measure of impulsivity among low-income elementary school-aged children. One hundred and ninety-three 9-11 year olds participating in a longitudinal intervention study performed a computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task, a validated measure of decision-making. Multi-level modeling was used to examine children&rsquo;s performance over the course of the task. In addition, age and gender were included in the models to determine whether student characteristics differentiated performance. Finally, teachers&rsquo; ratings of child impulsivity (BIS-11; Patton, Stanford, &amp; Barratt, 1995) were used to predict children&rsquo;s Iowa Gambling performance. Though previous research has found age and gender differences in IGT performance, results indicated no significant variation in IGT index scores across age or gender. Higher BIS scores, however, predicted a decrease in slope of Iowa Gambling performance, indicating students rated higher on impulsivity chose more disadvantageously across the task blocks. Results support evidence of the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task as a measure of impulsivity in low-income minority children.       Xinyue Guan Parent Involvement in Chinese Adolescents       Parent involvement is an important predictor of students&rsquo; academic achievement. However, little is known about the correlation between parent involvement and students&rsquo; academic achievement in mainland China. The current study aimed to examine parent involvement during the middle school years in the context of China. Seven hundred and ten 7th grade adolescents from three middle schools in Nanjing China and their mothers took part in the study as a part of the larger Nanjing Metropolitan Youth Project. Analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between maternal education, parent involvement, and students&rsquo; academic achievement. Results showed that students with mothers who had a college diploma or above reported more parent involvement than students with mothers who had a middle school diploma or lower. Perceived parent involvement did not directly predict students&rsquo; academic achievement; but the association was moderated by school type. Higher levels of perceived parent involvement were associated with higher students&rsquo; academic achievement in middle achieving school but not in low achieving school. The effects of gender and school type on students&rsquo; academic achievement are discussed.       Elise M. Harris An Exploration of the Relationship Between Interpersonal Forgiveness and Communalism Among African-American Adults       Scholars acknowledge that culture has implications for how people forgive interpersonally. However, few studies have investigated the role that cultural orientation may play in forgiveness among African American adults. The present study uses hierarchical regression to test empirically a model that explores the relative contributions of socio-demographic variables, domains of religiosity, empathy and comrnunalism to predicting interpersonal forgiveness among a sample of 241 adult African American men and women (ages 16-75). One&mdash;way ANOVAS revealed that participants with household incomes $70,000 and above had signi\ufb01cantly higher forgiveness mean scores than participants with household incomes $39,000 and below. Results of bivariate correlational analysis reveal that communalism, subjective religiosity, and empathic concern were signi\ufb01cantly and positively related to interpersonal forgiveness. Finally, a four step hierarchical regression model was conducted to determine if communalism is predictive of interpersonal forgiveness above and beyond socio&mdash;demographic variables, empathy and religiosity indices. The \ufb01ndings revealed that communalism is not a statistically signi\ufb01cant predictor of interpersonal forgiveness. However, subjective religiosity and empathy were signi\ufb01cant positive predictors of interpersonal forgiveness. Implications of these \ufb01ndings are discussed.       Emily Jacobson The Associations Between Risk and Protective Factors and Children&rsquo;s Academic Performance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)       Research shows that the presence of one or more risk factors is negatively associated with children&rsquo;s academic performance (Gutrnan, Sameroff, &amp; Cole, 2003). It has also been found that risk factors tend to cluster within individuals, and that the number of risk factors to which a child is exposed is sometimes more strongly associated with negative outcomes than the particular type of risk (Sameroff, Seifer, Barocas, Zax, &amp; Greenspan, 1987). Nonetheless, not every child exposed to risk develops negative outcomes. While certain factors have been studied as protective mechanisms for at-risk children (Ryzin, 2011), few studies to date have examined the cumulative effects of protective factors and hardly any research has considered their associations with academic outcomes (Van der Lann, Veenstra, Bogaerts, Verhulst, &amp; Ormel 2010), especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of existing literature on risk and protection comes from developed countries. The current study focuses on an understudied population of children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This study examines two risk/protection models, an individual model and a cumulative model, for predicting aspects of Congolese children&rsquo;s academic performance. The possibility that protective factors will moderate the negative association between risk factors and children&rsquo;s academic performance is also examined.       Juliana Karras Participant Research Engagement Within the Context of Evaluation Research       As funds available for social programs have decreased, criteria for program funding have become more rigorous (Paulsell, Avellar, Martin, &amp; Del Grosso, 2010), often requiring programs to demonstrate their practice is &ldquo;evidence&mdash;based&rdquo; (U.S. DHHS, 2011). In response, program evaluation research has proliferated (Donaldson, Christie, &amp; Mark, 2009). Traditionally, evaluation research focuses on participant engagement with program services. Within the context of an NYC program evaluation, authors theorize about the in\ufb02uence research processes have on participant engagement. A conceptual model is introduced which builds on the traditional notion of engagement in program services, by investigating what factors predict engagement with research. Logistical regression was use to examine whether baseline data collection was predicted by: (1) time lapse between communication with participants; (2) participant recruitment method; and (3) sample demographics (e.g. parent origin). Results suggest greater communication time&mdash;lapses negatively predicted baseline data collection, which indicate that research processes influence evaluation research.       Emily McFarlane   Designing an Intervention for LGBT Youth: The Role of Social Identity and Self-Concept       This paper presents a design for an intervention aimed at targeting the high rates of negative. behavioral and emotional issues found among LGBT youth. This population&rsquo;s social identity as sexual minority individuals affects the way they interact with an anti-LGBT biased society, which in turn affect LGBT youth&rsquo;s perceptions of themselves, or self-concept. Because compromised self-concept is a contributing factor to negative outcomes, this psychological construct is the target of this intervention. This paper also discusses the myriad issues that should be taken into account when conducting an intervention with a marginalized population, including program design, intervention and research methods, staffing, and rules regarding participation. The result is a creativity-based intervention that uses artistic skills as well as group discussion to explore self-concept as LGBT individuals; the results of this program can produce meaningful research on self-concept and the internalization of social bias in LGBT populations as well as how interventions can better serve marginalized populations.    Lillian Sindisiwe Nkhwashu Child Support Grant: Teenage Mothers&rsquo; Perceptions and Selected Characteristics    This study used survey research design to better understand the perceptions that female teenagers have on the implementation of Child Support Grant in relation to their life goals, social support, and decision-making regarding self. The study also explores the link that exists between teenage motherhood and Child Support Grant as perceived by female teenagers. It further describes teenage motherhood as a way to elicit ways in which teenage mothers understand the implications of teenage motherhood in South Africa. Two hundred and fifty (250) African/Black teenage mothers and 250 African/Black teenage non&mdash;mothers ages I 8 and 19 years registered full-time for grades 1 I and 12 in 2013 academic year public schools of Limpopo province of South Africa completed a self&mdash;report survey. The study hypothesized that; 1) Child Support Grant is associated with teenagers becoming pregnant; 2) early motherhood is associated with school interruption; and 3) early pregnancy interferes with life goals. The findings indicate that Child Support Grant is associated with dependency, is related to early pregnancy, and it is associated with school interruption; however, as this is a cross&mdash;sectional study, the directionality cannot be determined.       Kelly O&rsquo;Connor Sports in the Lives of Adolescent Girls       Previous research has shown sports to be an influential factor contributing to the development of not only athleticism, but also academic achievement, socialization processes, and the cultivation of social skills. Through sports, participants develop skills, habits, and values that are then transferable to other areas of life by integrating them into a larger social network of additional peers and adults. Research suggests that girls who participate in sports during school&mdash;aged years experience positive outcomes in the areas of academics and physical and mental health, and also have been found to identify relationships to be key aspects of their sporting experience, yet few studies examine the meaning of sports in the lives of such participants. The present study draws on interview data from 23 racially and ethnically diverse eighth grade girls who play sports to determine what meaning they make of sports in the context of their lives. Findings indicate that sports enhance friendships and aid in the development of girls&rsquo; awareness of gender discrimination. Implications for future research are discussed.       Justin Preston &ldquo;If They Abduct You, You Don&rsquo;t Come Back:&rdquo; Understanding the Child Soldier in Their Own Words       The investigator will be using narratives collected from northern Uganda that were created through the course of NET. The researcher conducting the analysis in the present study did not have any role in the creation and collection of the trauma narratives. There are few considerations in the literature of understanding how the children themselves reconstruct their time within the LRA and subsequent return to civil society, and there is even less directed towards the child soldier prior to their abduction. Life before the traumatic events experienced while a member of the rebel groups is rarely included in analysis, when life prior to the abduction is critical in helping to determine future development (Annan et al., 2009; Omstein, 2012). Much of the literature has only just begun to address the subjective experiences of the child soldiers themselves (e. g. Barber, 2009; Betancourt &amp; Khan, 2008; Boothby, Crawford, &amp; Mamade, 2009; Oloya, 2011; Wessells, 2006), and the majority of this research has focused on interventions at the level of the secondary and tertiary needs of the children themselves as well as focusing on assessing levels of PTSD in the population. The purpose of conducting this qualitative analysis of the life narratives of former child soldiers was to provide a better understanding of their experience of their past. There are two questions this research hoped to answer by studying and analyzing autobiographical narratives. These questions are largely exploratory in nature: 1) What are some themes that emerge across the narratives? 2) Do aspects of the children&rsquo;s pre-abduction experiences play a role in later portions of their narratives? By looking at the child in the larger context of their life narratives, this research expects to identify and discuss several qualitative themes that will help to elucidate and describe the psychological experiences of the children across the entire lifespan. This study will focus on their experiences within the LRA as well as before and after.       Emerald Shee The Development of Emotion Understanding in Ethnically Diverse Children at Ages Four and Five       Emotion understanding is the ability to identify the emotional meaning of others&rsquo; emotional expressions, demonstrated through nonverbal and verbal behaviors, which is essential for participation in society. However, little is known about the developmental course of emotion understanding in young children from ethnically diverse, low-income backgrounds even though they are often at risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The current study utilizes a pretend play assessment paradigm to examine the development of emotion understanding among Dominican-American, African American, Chinese-American, and Mexican-American children at ages four and five. Children were presented with six scenarios in which they had to label and reason about stipulated emotional states and emotions experienced by a protagonist. Children&rsquo;s emotion understanding was based on two criteria: whether children could label the valence and whether children could select the correct prop to annul the stipulated scenarios. These were examined across development and for gender and ethnic differences. Overall children improved in their emotion understanding from age four to age five, demonstrating the highest level of emotion understanding through labeling the valence of the stipulated scenarios. Girls were better than boys in labeling the valence. Chinese-American children demonstrated worse competency in emotion understanding compared to the other three groups. Between the two ages tested, children from each ethnic background followed a similar developmental trajectory in their ability to understand others&rsquo; emotional states and emotions. Even though, there are similar patterns demonstrated across groups, there are still specific ethnic and gender differences, which are important to explore further in the future.       Pei-Chen Tsai Exploration of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People&rsquo;s Disclosure, Risk, and Mental Health in the Workplace       Recently, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population has become more visible in American society and across the world. Although American society has started to pay more attention to LGBT people&rsquo;s rights and mental health, they remain stigmatized and invisible in certain areas most notably in the workplace. Most LGBT workers choose to stay in the closet (i.e., conceal one&rsquo;s sexual orientation/gender identity) because they are not sure whether the work environment is safe and whether disclosing their sexual orientation will jeopardize their careers or not. The purpose of this study was to: 1. Use data collected from a sample of LGBT older adults (ages 60 to 88) from the United States to examine relationships among personal factors (ethnicity, level of education, and income), experiences of discrimination (at/outside work), personal mental health (self-esteem and depression), and a major coping strategy (disclosure) in the workplace. 2. To interpret the results from the current analyses and review existing literature to provide information about participants&rsquo; experiences of dealing with disclosure in the workplace and its consequence in terms of mental health. Results indicate that sexual orientation disclosure status at work is correlated with one&rsquo;s disclosure status outside of work, as well as one&rsquo;s experiences of victimization outside of work. In terms of mental health, unexpectedly, there was no significant correlation between either victimization at work and depression or between victimization at work and self-esteem.    Angel Venegas Improving Communication of Certified Nursing Assistants with Older Adult Males in Nursing Homes: Reducing Elderspeak       American nursing homes are in dire need of re-evaluating the quality of care they provide to the rapidly growing aging population. This is further supported by numerous studies that indicate that the majority of certi\ufb01ed nursing assistants (CNA) lack training, as evidenced by the few evidence&mdash;based interventions employed to educate them on gender differences in providing care to residents. Consequently, communication is a critical component overlooked in the process. In chapter one, background information regarding aging and nursing homes in the United States is discussed. Also, emphasis is placed on older adult males, certified nursing assistants, and elderspeak &mdash; the faulty communication style that is prevalent between them in the nursing home setting. Chapters two and three present the Certified Nursing Assistant Certified Communication Educational Program as a conceivable intervention to remedy this issue, and groundwork for possible further examination and use within the nursing home setting.       Danielle A. Wright The Development Process of Health Interventions to Promote Physical Activity Among Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review       Lifestyle interventions that promote healthy behaviors have the potential to reduce adverse effects of cancer treatments and improve overall quality of life in cancer patients. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of physical activity interventions for cancer patients and to assess the methodological design and implementation strategies of these of interventions. Relevant literature from published, peer-reviewed articles was utilized to address the aim of this review. Initial key search terms included: cancer AND lifestyle behavior, health behavior, exercise, physical activity, physical fitness, intervention, development, process, framework, and designing. Data was extracted and coded for characteristics of participants, objectives, theoretical framework, intervention design/methods, intervention delivery, outcome measures, and results. Study quality was assessed using a standardized measure. Fourteen articles representing 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Delivery methods included training sessions and telephone based counseling, and the majority of studies incorporated a theoretical basis. Intervention Mapping strategies were often implicitly stated in the studies. Significant differences in both physical activity behaviors and quality of life outcomes were found in three studies with mixed findings in five of the studies. One study did not show significance in either physical activity or quality of life and one study only presented the study protocol. Designing health interventions that integrate strategic intervention planning and community participation may have strong indications for creating health communications that would be adopted in practice and target vulnerable populations.

The majority of existing literature on risk and protection comes from developed countries. The current study focuses on an understudied population of children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This study examines two risk/protection models, an individual model and a cumulative model, for predicting aspects of Congolese children&rsquo;s academic performance. The possibility that protective factors will moderate the negative association between risk factors and children&rsquo;s academic performance is also examined.       Juliana Karras Participant Research Engagement Within the Context of Evaluation Research       As funds available for social programs have decreased, criteria for program funding have become more rigorous (Paulsell, Avellar, Martin, &amp; Del Grosso, 2010), often requiring programs to demonstrate their practice is &ldquo;evidence&mdash;based&rdquo; (U.S. DHHS, 2011). In response, program evaluation research has proliferated (Donaldson, Christie, &amp; Mark, 2009). Traditionally, evaluation research focuses on participant engagement with program services. Within the context of an NYC program evaluation, authors theorize about the in\ufb02uence research processes have on participant engagement. A conceptual model is introduced which builds on the traditional notion of engagement in program services, by investigating what factors predict engagement with research. Logistical regression was use to examine whether baseline data collection was predicted by: (1) time lapse between communication with participants; (2) participant recruitment method; and (3) sample demographics (e.g. parent origin). Results suggest greater communication time&mdash;lapses negatively predicted baseline data collection, which indicate that research processes influence evaluation research.       Emily McFarlane   Designing an Intervention for LGBT Youth: The Role of Social Identity and Self-Concept       This paper presents a design for an intervention aimed at targeting the high rates of negative. behavioral and emotional issues found among LGBT youth. This population&rsquo;s social identity as sexual minority individuals affects the way they interact with an anti-LGBT biased society, which in turn affect LGBT youth&rsquo;s perceptions of themselves, or self-concept. Because compromised self-concept is a contributing factor to negative outcomes, this psychological construct is the target of this intervention. This paper also discusses the myriad issues that should be taken into account when conducting an intervention with a marginalized population, including program design, intervention and research methods, staffing, and rules regarding participation. The result is a creativity-based intervention that uses artistic skills as well as group discussion to explore self-concept as LGBT individuals; the results of this program can produce meaningful research on self-concept and the internalization of social bias in LGBT populations as well as how interventions can better serve marginalized populations.    Lillian Sindisiwe Nkhwashu Child Support Grant: Teenage Mothers&rsquo; Perceptions and Selected Characteristics    This study used survey research design to better understand the perceptions that female teenagers have on the implementation of Child Support Grant in relation to their life goals, social support, and decision-making regarding self. The study also explores the link that exists between teenage motherhood and Child Support Grant as perceived by female teenagers. It further describes teenage motherhood as a way to elicit ways in which teenage mothers understand the implications of teenage motherhood in South Africa. Two hundred and fifty (250) African/Black teenage mothers and 250 African/Black teenage non&mdash;mothers ages I 8 and 19 years registered full-time for grades 1 I and 12 in 2013 academic year public schools of Limpopo province of South Africa completed a self&mdash;report survey. The study hypothesized that; 1) Child Support Grant is associated with teenagers becoming pregnant; 2) early motherhood is associated with school interruption; and 3) early pregnancy interferes with life goals. The findings indicate that Child Support Grant is associated with dependency, is related to early pregnancy, and it is associated with school interruption; however, as this is a cross&mdash;sectional study, the directionality cannot be determined.       Kelly O&rsquo;Connor Sports in the Lives of Adolescent Girls       Previous research has shown sports to be an influential factor contributing to the development of not only athleticism, but also academic achievement, socialization processes, and the cultivation of social skills. Through sports, participants develop skills, habits, and values that are then transferable to other areas of life by integrating them into a larger social network of additional peers and adults. Research suggests that girls who participate in sports during school&mdash;aged years experience positive outcomes in the areas of academics and physical and mental health, and also have been found to identify relationships to be key aspects of their sporting experience, yet few studies examine the meaning of sports in the lives of such participants. The present study draws on interview data from 23 racially and ethnically diverse eighth grade girls who play sports to determine what meaning they make of sports in the context of their lives. Findings indicate that sports enhance friendships and aid in the development of girls&rsquo; awareness of gender discrimination. Implications for future research are discussed.       Justin Preston &ldquo;If They Abduct You, You Don&rsquo;t Come Back:&rdquo; Understanding the Child Soldier in Their Own Words       The investigator will be using narratives collected from northern Uganda that were created through the course of NET. The researcher conducting the analysis in the present study did not have any role in the creation and collection of the trauma narratives. There are few considerations in the literature of understanding how the children themselves reconstruct their time within the LRA and subsequent return to civil society, and there is even less directed towards the child soldier prior to their abduction. Life before the traumatic events experienced while a member of the rebel groups is rarely included in analysis, when life prior to the abduction is critical in helping to determine future development (Annan et al., 2009; Omstein, 2012). Much of the literature has only just begun to address the subjective experiences of the child soldiers themselves (e. g. Barber, 2009; Betancourt &amp; Khan, 2008; Boothby, Crawford, &amp; Mamade, 2009; Oloya, 2011; Wessells, 2006), and the majority of this research has focused on interventions at the level of the secondary and tertiary needs of the children themselves as well as focusing on assessing levels of PTSD in the population. The purpose of conducting this qualitative analysis of the life narratives of former child soldiers was to provide a better understanding of their experience of their past. There are two questions this research hoped to answer by studying and analyzing autobiographical narratives. These questions are largely exploratory in nature: 1) What are some themes that emerge across the narratives? 2) Do aspects of the children&rsquo;s pre-abduction experiences play a role in later portions of their narratives? By looking at the child in the larger context of their life narratives, this research expects to identify and discuss several qualitative themes that will help to elucidate and describe the psychological experiences of the children across the entire lifespan. This study will focus on their experiences within the LRA as well as before and after.       Emerald Shee The Development of Emotion Understanding in Ethnically Diverse Children at Ages Four and Five       Emotion understanding is the ability to identify the emotional meaning of others&rsquo; emotional expressions, demonstrated through nonverbal and verbal behaviors, which is essential for participation in society. However, little is known about the developmental course of emotion understanding in young children from ethnically diverse, low-income backgrounds even though they are often at risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The current study utilizes a pretend play assessment paradigm to examine the development of emotion understanding among Dominican-American, African American, Chinese-American, and Mexican-American children at ages four and five. Children were presented with six scenarios in which they had to label and reason about stipulated emotional states and emotions experienced by a protagonist. Children&rsquo;s emotion understanding was based on two criteria: whether children could label the valence and whether children could select the correct prop to annul the stipulated scenarios. These were examined across development and for gender and ethnic differences. Overall children improved in their emotion understanding from age four to age five, demonstrating the highest level of emotion understanding through labeling the valence of the stipulated scenarios. Girls were better than boys in labeling the valence. Chinese-American children demonstrated worse competency in emotion understanding compared to the other three groups. Between the two ages tested, children from each ethnic background followed a similar developmental trajectory in their ability to understand others&rsquo; emotional states and emotions. Even though, there are similar patterns demonstrated across groups, there are still specific ethnic and gender differences, which are important to explore further in the future.       Pei-Chen Tsai Exploration of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People&rsquo;s Disclosure, Risk, and Mental Health in the Workplace       Recently, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population has become more visible in American society and across the world. Although American society has started to pay more attention to LGBT people&rsquo;s rights and mental health, they remain stigmatized and invisible in certain areas most notably in the workplace. Most LGBT workers choose to stay in the closet (i.e., conceal one&rsquo;s sexual orientation/gender identity) because they are not sure whether the work environment is safe and whether disclosing their sexual orientation will jeopardize their careers or not. The purpose of this study was to: 1. Use data collected from a sample of LGBT older adults (ages 60 to 88) from the United States to examine relationships among personal factors (ethnicity, level of education, and income), experiences of discrimination (at/outside work), personal mental health (self-esteem and depression), and a major coping strategy (disclosure) in the workplace. 2. To interpret the results from the current analyses and review existing literature to provide information about participants&rsquo; experiences of dealing with disclosure in the workplace and its consequence in terms of mental health. Results indicate that sexual orientation disclosure status at work is correlated with one&rsquo;s disclosure status outside of work, as well as one&rsquo;s experiences of victimization outside of work. In terms of mental health, unexpectedly, there was no significant correlation between either victimization at work and depression or between victimization at work and self-esteem.    Angel Venegas Improving Communication of Certified Nursing Assistants with Older Adult Males in Nursing Homes: Reducing Elderspeak       American nursing homes are in dire need of re-evaluating the quality of care they provide to the rapidly growing aging population. This is further supported by numerous studies that indicate that the majority of certi\ufb01ed nursing assistants (CNA) lack training, as evidenced by the few evidence&mdash;based interventions employed to educate them on gender differences in providing care to residents. Consequently, communication is a critical component overlooked in the process. In chapter one, background information regarding aging and nursing homes in the United States is discussed. Also, emphasis is placed on older adult males, certified nursing assistants, and elderspeak &mdash; the faulty communication style that is prevalent between them in the nursing home setting. Chapters two and three present the Certified Nursing Assistant Certified Communication Educational Program as a conceivable intervention to remedy this issue, and groundwork for possible further examination and use within the nursing home setting.       Danielle A. Wright The Development Process of Health Interventions to Promote Physical Activity Among Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review       Lifestyle interventions that promote healthy behaviors have the potential to reduce adverse effects of cancer treatments and improve overall quality of life in cancer patients. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of physical activity interventions for cancer patients and to assess the methodological design and implementation strategies of these of interventions. Relevant literature from published, peer-reviewed articles was utilized to address the aim of this review. Initial key search terms included: cancer AND lifestyle behavior, health behavior, exercise, physical activity, physical fitness, intervention, development, process, framework, and designing. Data was extracted and coded for characteristics of participants, objectives, theoretical framework, intervention design/methods, intervention delivery, outcome measures, and results. Study quality was assessed using a standardized measure. Fourteen articles representing 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Delivery methods included training sessions and telephone based counseling, and the majority of studies incorporated a theoretical basis. Intervention Mapping strategies were often implicitly stated in the studies. Significant differences in both physical activity behaviors and quality of life outcomes were found in three studies with mixed findings in five of the studies. One study did not show significance in either physical activity or quality of life and one study only presented the study protocol. Designing health interventions that integrate strategic intervention planning and community participation may have strong indications for creating health communications that would be adopted in practice and target vulnerable populations.

To what extent are these gendered distinctions also seen in diverse ethnic groups? How are they expressed? In this study, gender role beliefs and values of African-American (AA), Dominican-American (DA), and Mexican-American (MA) mothers were examined using qualitative methods. What gender role beliefs and expectations do AA, DA, and MA mothers hold for their children? Participants included 5 AA, 6 DA, and 7 MA mothers whose children were between 8 months and 2 years of age. Mothers of boys and mothers of girls were asked a series of open-ended questions about their experiences in raising their children. Their responses were transcribed and analyzed for thematic content. 12 themes emerged from the interviews, and were divided into three broad categories: child characteristics, parenting, and other gender domains. These themes were expressed by mothers of all three ethnicities. Themes for child characteristics were 1) Compliance vs. Defiance, 2) Gentleness vs. Roughness, 3) Emotional Sensitivity vs. Emotional Stoicism, and 4) Attachment vs. Independence. Themes for parenting were 5) Mother Role vs. Father Role, 6) Soft Hands vs. Harsh Forms of Discipline, 7) Educational Hopes vs. Educational Fears, and 8) Protection. Themes expressed in other areas included gendered beliefs about Appearance, Activities, and Status/Values. Knowledge of gender role beliefs can help provide a better understanding of parents&rsquo; behavior and their socio-culturally specific ways of socializing gender with their children.       Jessica Burdick Evaluating the Iowa Gambling Task as a Direct Assessment of Impulsivity with Elementary School-Aged Children       The goal of this study is to evaluate the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson, 1994) as a direct assessment measure of impulsivity among low-income elementary school-aged children. One hundred and ninety-three 9-11 year olds participating in a longitudinal intervention study performed a computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task, a validated measure of decision-making. Multi-level modeling was used to examine children&rsquo;s performance over the course of the task. In addition, age and gender were included in the models to determine whether student characteristics differentiated performance. Finally, teachers&rsquo; ratings of child impulsivity (BIS-11; Patton, Stanford, &amp; Barratt, 1995) were used to predict children&rsquo;s Iowa Gambling performance. Though previous research has found age and gender differences in IGT performance, results indicated no significant variation in IGT index scores across age or gender. Higher BIS scores, however, predicted a decrease in slope of Iowa Gambling performance, indicating students rated higher on impulsivity chose more disadvantageously across the task blocks. Results support evidence of the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task as a measure of impulsivity in low-income minority children.       Xinyue Guan Parent Involvement in Chinese Adolescents       Parent involvement is an important predictor of students&rsquo; academic achievement. However, little is known about the correlation between parent involvement and students&rsquo; academic achievement in mainland China. The current study aimed to examine parent involvement during the middle school years in the context of China. Seven hundred and ten 7th grade adolescents from three middle schools in Nanjing China and their mothers took part in the study as a part of the larger Nanjing Metropolitan Youth Project. Analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between maternal education, parent involvement, and students&rsquo; academic achievement. Results showed that students with mothers who had a college diploma or above reported more parent involvement than students with mothers who had a middle school diploma or lower. Perceived parent involvement did not directly predict students&rsquo; academic achievement; but the association was moderated by school type. Higher levels of perceived parent involvement were associated with higher students&rsquo; academic achievement in middle achieving school but not in low achieving school. The effects of gender and school type on students&rsquo; academic achievement are discussed.       Elise M. Harris An Exploration of the Relationship Between Interpersonal Forgiveness and Communalism Among African-American Adults       Scholars acknowledge that culture has implications for how people forgive interpersonally. However, few studies have investigated the role that cultural orientation may play in forgiveness among African American adults. The present study uses hierarchical regression to test empirically a model that explores the relative contributions of socio-demographic variables, domains of religiosity, empathy and comrnunalism to predicting interpersonal forgiveness among a sample of 241 adult African American men and women (ages 16-75). One&mdash;way ANOVAS revealed that participants with household incomes $70,000 and above had signi\ufb01cantly higher forgiveness mean scores than participants with household incomes $39,000 and below. Results of bivariate correlational analysis reveal that communalism, subjective religiosity, and empathic concern were signi\ufb01cantly and positively related to interpersonal forgiveness. Finally, a four step hierarchical regression model was conducted to determine if communalism is predictive of interpersonal forgiveness above and beyond socio&mdash;demographic variables, empathy and religiosity indices. The \ufb01ndings revealed that communalism is not a statistically signi\ufb01cant predictor of interpersonal forgiveness. However, subjective religiosity and empathy were signi\ufb01cant positive predictors of interpersonal forgiveness. Implications of these \ufb01ndings are discussed.       Emily Jacobson The Associations Between Risk and Protective Factors and Children&rsquo;s Academic Performance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)       Research shows that the presence of one or more risk factors is negatively associated with children&rsquo;s academic performance (Gutrnan, Sameroff, &amp; Cole, 2003). It has also been found that risk factors tend to cluster within individuals, and that the number of risk factors to which a child is exposed is sometimes more strongly associated with negative outcomes than the particular type of risk (Sameroff, Seifer, Barocas, Zax, &amp; Greenspan, 1987). Nonetheless, not every child exposed to risk develops negative outcomes. While certain factors have been studied as protective mechanisms for at-risk children (Ryzin, 2011), few studies to date have examined the cumulative effects of protective factors and hardly any research has considered their associations with academic outcomes (Van der Lann, Veenstra, Bogaerts, Verhulst, &amp; Ormel 2010), especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of existing literature on risk and protection comes from developed countries. The current study focuses on an understudied population of children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This study examines two risk/protection models, an individual model and a cumulative model, for predicting aspects of Congolese children&rsquo;s academic performance. The possibility that protective factors will moderate the negative association between risk factors and children&rsquo;s academic performance is also examined.       Juliana Karras Participant Research Engagement Within the Context of Evaluation Research       As funds available for social programs have decreased, criteria for program funding have become more rigorous (Paulsell, Avellar, Martin, &amp; Del Grosso, 2010), often requiring programs to demonstrate their practice is &ldquo;evidence&mdash;based&rdquo; (U.S. DHHS, 2011). In response, program evaluation research has proliferated (Donaldson, Christie, &amp; Mark, 2009). Traditionally, evaluation research focuses on participant engagement with program services. Within the context of an NYC program evaluation, authors theorize about the in\ufb02uence research processes have on participant engagement. A conceptual model is introduced which builds on the traditional notion of engagement in program services, by investigating what factors predict engagement with research. Logistical regression was use to examine whether baseline data collection was predicted by: (1) time lapse between communication with participants; (2) participant recruitment method; and (3) sample demographics (e.g. parent origin). Results suggest greater communication time&mdash;lapses negatively predicted baseline data collection, which indicate that research processes influence evaluation research.       Emily McFarlane   Designing an Intervention for LGBT Youth: The Role of Social Identity and Self-Concept       This paper presents a design for an intervention aimed at targeting the high rates of negative. behavioral and emotional issues found among LGBT youth. This population&rsquo;s social identity as sexual minority individuals affects the way they interact with an anti-LGBT biased society, which in turn affect LGBT youth&rsquo;s perceptions of themselves, or self-concept. Because compromised self-concept is a contributing factor to negative outcomes, this psychological construct is the target of this intervention. This paper also discusses the myriad issues that should be taken into account when conducting an intervention with a marginalized population, including program design, intervention and research methods, staffing, and rules regarding participation. The result is a creativity-based intervention that uses artistic skills as well as group discussion to explore self-concept as LGBT individuals; the results of this program can produce meaningful research on self-concept and the internalization of social bias in LGBT populations as well as how interventions can better serve marginalized populations.    Lillian Sindisiwe Nkhwashu Child Support Grant: Teenage Mothers&rsquo; Perceptions and Selected Characteristics    This study used survey research design to better understand the perceptions that female teenagers have on the implementation of Child Support Grant in relation to their life goals, social support, and decision-making regarding self. The study also explores the link that exists between teenage motherhood and Child Support Grant as perceived by female teenagers. It further describes teenage motherhood as a way to elicit ways in which teenage mothers understand the implications of teenage motherhood in South Africa. Two hundred and fifty (250) African/Black teenage mothers and 250 African/Black teenage non&mdash;mothers ages I 8 and 19 years registered full-time for grades 1 I and 12 in 2013 academic year public schools of Limpopo province of South Africa completed a self&mdash;report survey. The study hypothesized that; 1) Child Support Grant is associated with teenagers becoming pregnant; 2) early motherhood is associated with school interruption; and 3) early pregnancy interferes with life goals. The findings indicate that Child Support Grant is associated with dependency, is related to early pregnancy, and it is associated with school interruption; however, as this is a cross&mdash;sectional study, the directionality cannot be determined.       Kelly O&rsquo;Connor Sports in the Lives of Adolescent Girls       Previous research has shown sports to be an influential factor contributing to the development of not only athleticism, but also academic achievement, socialization processes, and the cultivation of social skills. Through sports, participants develop skills, habits, and values that are then transferable to other areas of life by integrating them into a larger social network of additional peers and adults. Research suggests that girls who participate in sports during school&mdash;aged years experience positive outcomes in the areas of academics and physical and mental health, and also have been found to identify relationships to be key aspects of their sporting experience, yet few studies examine the meaning of sports in the lives of such participants. The present study draws on interview data from 23 racially and ethnically diverse eighth grade girls who play sports to determine what meaning they make of sports in the context of their lives. Findings indicate that sports enhance friendships and aid in the development of girls&rsquo; awareness of gender discrimination. Implications for future research are discussed.       Justin Preston &ldquo;If They Abduct You, You Don&rsquo;t Come Back:&rdquo; Understanding the Child Soldier in Their Own Words       The investigator will be using narratives collected from northern Uganda that were created through the course of NET. The researcher conducting the analysis in the present study did not have any role in the creation and collection of the trauma narratives. There are few considerations in the literature of understanding how the children themselves reconstruct their time within the LRA and subsequent return to civil society, and there is even less directed towards the child soldier prior to their abduction. Life before the traumatic events experienced while a member of the rebel groups is rarely included in analysis, when life prior to the abduction is critical in helping to determine future development (Annan et al., 2009; Omstein, 2012). Much of the literature has only just begun to address the subjective experiences of the child soldiers themselves (e. g. Barber, 2009; Betancourt &amp; Khan, 2008; Boothby, Crawford, &amp; Mamade, 2009; Oloya, 2011; Wessells, 2006), and the majority of this research has focused on interventions at the level of the secondary and tertiary needs of the children themselves as well as focusing on assessing levels of PTSD in the population. The purpose of conducting this qualitative analysis of the life narratives of former child soldiers was to provide a better understanding of their experience of their past. There are two questions this research hoped to answer by studying and analyzing autobiographical narratives. These questions are largely exploratory in nature: 1) What are some themes that emerge across the narratives? 2) Do aspects of the children&rsquo;s pre-abduction experiences play a role in later portions of their narratives? By looking at the child in the larger context of their life narratives, this research expects to identify and discuss several qualitative themes that will help to elucidate and describe the psychological experiences of the children across the entire lifespan. This study will focus on their experiences within the LRA as well as before and after.       Emerald Shee The Development of Emotion Understanding in Ethnically Diverse Children at Ages Four and Five       Emotion understanding is the ability to identify the emotional meaning of others&rsquo; emotional expressions, demonstrated through nonverbal and verbal behaviors, which is essential for participation in society. However, little is known about the developmental course of emotion understanding in young children from ethnically diverse, low-income backgrounds even though they are often at risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The current study utilizes a pretend play assessment paradigm to examine the development of emotion understanding among Dominican-American, African American, Chinese-American, and Mexican-American children at ages four and five. Children were presented with six scenarios in which they had to label and reason about stipulated emotional states and emotions experienced by a protagonist. Children&rsquo;s emotion understanding was based on two criteria: whether children could label the valence and whether children could select the correct prop to annul the stipulated scenarios. These were examined across development and for gender and ethnic differences. Overall children improved in their emotion understanding from age four to age five, demonstrating the highest level of emotion understanding through labeling the valence of the stipulated scenarios. Girls were better than boys in labeling the valence. Chinese-American children demonstrated worse competency in emotion understanding compared to the other three groups. Between the two ages tested, children from each ethnic background followed a similar developmental trajectory in their ability to understand others&rsquo; emotional states and emotions. Even though, there are similar patterns demonstrated across groups, there are still specific ethnic and gender differences, which are important to explore further in the future.       Pei-Chen Tsai Exploration of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People&rsquo;s Disclosure, Risk, and Mental Health in the Workplace       Recently, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population has become more visible in American society and across the world. Although American society has started to pay more attention to LGBT people&rsquo;s rights and mental health, they remain stigmatized and invisible in certain areas most notably in the workplace. Most LGBT workers choose to stay in the closet (i.e., conceal one&rsquo;s sexual orientation/gender identity) because they are not sure whether the work environment is safe and whether disclosing their sexual orientation will jeopardize their careers or not. The purpose of this study was to: 1. Use data collected from a sample of LGBT older adults (ages 60 to 88) from the United States to examine relationships among personal factors (ethnicity, level of education, and income), experiences of discrimination (at/outside work), personal mental health (self-esteem and depression), and a major coping strategy (disclosure) in the workplace. 2. To interpret the results from the current analyses and review existing literature to provide information about participants&rsquo; experiences of dealing with disclosure in the workplace and its consequence in terms of mental health. Results indicate that sexual orientation disclosure status at work is correlated with one&rsquo;s disclosure status outside of work, as well as one&rsquo;s experiences of victimization outside of work. In terms of mental health, unexpectedly, there was no significant correlation between either victimization at work and depression or between victimization at work and self-esteem.    Angel Venegas Improving Communication of Certified Nursing Assistants with Older Adult Males in Nursing Homes: Reducing Elderspeak       American nursing homes are in dire need of re-evaluating the quality of care they provide to the rapidly growing aging population. This is further supported by numerous studies that indicate that the majority of certi\ufb01ed nursing assistants (CNA) lack training, as evidenced by the few evidence&mdash;based interventions employed to educate them on gender differences in providing care to residents. Consequently, communication is a critical component overlooked in the process. In chapter one, background information regarding aging and nursing homes in the United States is discussed. Also, emphasis is placed on older adult males, certified nursing assistants, and elderspeak &mdash; the faulty communication style that is prevalent between them in the nursing home setting. Chapters two and three present the Certified Nursing Assistant Certified Communication Educational Program as a conceivable intervention to remedy this issue, and groundwork for possible further examination and use within the nursing home setting.       Danielle A. Wright The Development Process of Health Interventions to Promote Physical Activity Among Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review       Lifestyle interventions that promote healthy behaviors have the potential to reduce adverse effects of cancer treatments and improve overall quality of life in cancer patients. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of physical activity interventions for cancer patients and to assess the methodological design and implementation strategies of these of interventions. Relevant literature from published, peer-reviewed articles was utilized to address the aim of this review. Initial key search terms included: cancer AND lifestyle behavior, health behavior, exercise, physical activity, physical fitness, intervention, development, process, framework, and designing. Data was extracted and coded for characteristics of participants, objectives, theoretical framework, intervention design/methods, intervention delivery, outcome measures, and results. Study quality was assessed using a standardized measure. Fourteen articles representing 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Delivery methods included training sessions and telephone based counseling, and the majority of studies incorporated a theoretical basis. Intervention Mapping strategies were often implicitly stated in the studies. Significant differences in both physical activity behaviors and quality of life outcomes were found in three studies with mixed findings in five of the studies. One study did not show significance in either physical activity or quality of life and one study only presented the study protocol. Designing health interventions that integrate strategic intervention planning and community participation may have strong indications for creating health communications that would be adopted in practice and target vulnerable populations.

Social Intervention              Diane Hughes is professor of Applied Psychology in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Development, and Education and co-director with Catherine Tamis LeMonda and Niobe Way of the Center for Research on Culture, Development, and Education. Her research interests focus on (a) understanding how racial/ethnic dynamics influence individual's experiences across multiple settings including workplaces, classrooms, neighborhoods, and families, and (b) ethnic and cultural differences in parents' socialization goals, beliefs, and practices, especially as these influence children's learning. Dr. Hughes conducts school and community based studies with adolescents and their parents using multiple methods (interviews, surveys, focus groups). In her most recent work. Dr. Hughes, Dr. Niobe Way, and their students followed two multi-ethnic cohorts of NYC early adolescents (and their mothers) from the time they entered middle school through their junior year of high school to understand how varied stressors and supports influenced academic and socio-emotional development over time. Hughes received her B.A. in Psychology and African American Studies from Williams College and her Ph.D. in Community and Developmental Psychology from the University of Michigan. She is former chair of the John d. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's sub-group on Diversity in Mid-Life and co-chair of the 14 member cross-university Study Group on Race, Culture, and ethnicity. Her research has been supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Coundation, the William T.

To what extent are these gendered distinctions also seen in diverse ethnic groups? How are they expressed? In this study, gender role beliefs and values of African-American (AA), Dominican-American (DA), and Mexican-American (MA) mothers were examined using qualitative methods. What gender role beliefs and expectations do AA, DA, and MA mothers hold for their children? Participants included 5 AA, 6 DA, and 7 MA mothers whose children were between 8 months and 2 years of age. Mothers of boys and mothers of girls were asked a series of open-ended questions about their experiences in raising their children. Their responses were transcribed and analyzed for thematic content. 12 themes emerged from the interviews, and were divided into three broad categories: child characteristics, parenting, and other gender domains. These themes were expressed by mothers of all three ethnicities. Themes for child characteristics were 1) Compliance vs. Defiance, 2) Gentleness vs. Roughness, 3) Emotional Sensitivity vs. Emotional Stoicism, and 4) Attachment vs. Independence. Themes for parenting were 5) Mother Role vs. Father Role, 6) Soft Hands vs. Harsh Forms of Discipline, 7) Educational Hopes vs. Educational Fears, and 8) Protection. Themes expressed in other areas included gendered beliefs about Appearance, Activities, and Status/Values. Knowledge of gender role beliefs can help provide a better understanding of parents&rsquo; behavior and their socio-culturally specific ways of socializing gender with their children.       Jessica Burdick Evaluating the Iowa Gambling Task as a Direct Assessment of Impulsivity with Elementary School-Aged Children       The goal of this study is to evaluate the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson, 1994) as a direct assessment measure of impulsivity among low-income elementary school-aged children. One hundred and ninety-three 9-11 year olds participating in a longitudinal intervention study performed a computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task, a validated measure of decision-making. Multi-level modeling was used to examine children&rsquo;s performance over the course of the task. In addition, age and gender were included in the models to determine whether student characteristics differentiated performance. Finally, teachers&rsquo; ratings of child impulsivity (BIS-11; Patton, Stanford, &amp; Barratt, 1995) were used to predict children&rsquo;s Iowa Gambling performance. Though previous research has found age and gender differences in IGT performance, results indicated no significant variation in IGT index scores across age or gender. Higher BIS scores, however, predicted a decrease in slope of Iowa Gambling performance, indicating students rated higher on impulsivity chose more disadvantageously across the task blocks. Results support evidence of the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task as a measure of impulsivity in low-income minority children.       Xinyue Guan Parent Involvement in Chinese Adolescents       Parent involvement is an important predictor of students&rsquo; academic achievement. However, little is known about the correlation between parent involvement and students&rsquo; academic achievement in mainland China. The current study aimed to examine parent involvement during the middle school years in the context of China. Seven hundred and ten 7th grade adolescents from three middle schools in Nanjing China and their mothers took part in the study as a part of the larger Nanjing Metropolitan Youth Project. Analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between maternal education, parent involvement, and students&rsquo; academic achievement. Results showed that students with mothers who had a college diploma or above reported more parent involvement than students with mothers who had a middle school diploma or lower. Perceived parent involvement did not directly predict students&rsquo; academic achievement; but the association was moderated by school type. Higher levels of perceived parent involvement were associated with higher students&rsquo; academic achievement in middle achieving school but not in low achieving school. The effects of gender and school type on students&rsquo; academic achievement are discussed.       Elise M. Harris An Exploration of the Relationship Between Interpersonal Forgiveness and Communalism Among African-American Adults       Scholars acknowledge that culture has implications for how people forgive interpersonally. However, few studies have investigated the role that cultural orientation may play in forgiveness among African American adults. The present study uses hierarchical regression to test empirically a model that explores the relative contributions of socio-demographic variables, domains of religiosity, empathy and comrnunalism to predicting interpersonal forgiveness among a sample of 241 adult African American men and women (ages 16-75). One&mdash;way ANOVAS revealed that participants with household incomes $70,000 and above had signi\ufb01cantly higher forgiveness mean scores than participants with household incomes $39,000 and below. Results of bivariate correlational analysis reveal that communalism, subjective religiosity, and empathic concern were signi\ufb01cantly and positively related to interpersonal forgiveness. Finally, a four step hierarchical regression model was conducted to determine if communalism is predictive of interpersonal forgiveness above and beyond socio&mdash;demographic variables, empathy and religiosity indices. The \ufb01ndings revealed that communalism is not a statistically signi\ufb01cant predictor of interpersonal forgiveness. However, subjective religiosity and empathy were signi\ufb01cant positive predictors of interpersonal forgiveness. Implications of these \ufb01ndings are discussed.       Emily Jacobson The Associations Between Risk and Protective Factors and Children&rsquo;s Academic Performance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)       Research shows that the presence of one or more risk factors is negatively associated with children&rsquo;s academic performance (Gutrnan, Sameroff, &amp; Cole, 2003). It has also been found that risk factors tend to cluster within individuals, and that the number of risk factors to which a child is exposed is sometimes more strongly associated with negative outcomes than the particular type of risk (Sameroff, Seifer, Barocas, Zax, &amp; Greenspan, 1987). Nonetheless, not every child exposed to risk develops negative outcomes. While certain factors have been studied as protective mechanisms for at-risk children (Ryzin, 2011), few studies to date have examined the cumulative effects of protective factors and hardly any research has considered their associations with academic outcomes (Van der Lann, Veenstra, Bogaerts, Verhulst, &amp; Ormel 2010), especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of existing literature on risk and protection comes from developed countries. The current study focuses on an understudied population of children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This study examines two risk/protection models, an individual model and a cumulative model, for predicting aspects of Congolese children&rsquo;s academic performance. The possibility that protective factors will moderate the negative association between risk factors and children&rsquo;s academic performance is also examined.       Juliana Karras Participant Research Engagement Within the Context of Evaluation Research       As funds available for social programs have decreased, criteria for program funding have become more rigorous (Paulsell, Avellar, Martin, &amp; Del Grosso, 2010), often requiring programs to demonstrate their practice is &ldquo;evidence&mdash;based&rdquo; (U.S. DHHS, 2011). In response, program evaluation research has proliferated (Donaldson, Christie, &amp; Mark, 2009). Traditionally, evaluation research focuses on participant engagement with program services. Within the context of an NYC program evaluation, authors theorize about the in\ufb02uence research processes have on participant engagement. A conceptual model is introduced which builds on the traditional notion of engagement in program services, by investigating what factors predict engagement with research. Logistical regression was use to examine whether baseline data collection was predicted by: (1) time lapse between communication with participants; (2) participant recruitment method; and (3) sample demographics (e.g. parent origin). Results suggest greater communication time&mdash;lapses negatively predicted baseline data collection, which indicate that research processes influence evaluation research.       Emily McFarlane   Designing an Intervention for LGBT Youth: The Role of Social Identity and Self-Concept       This paper presents a design for an intervention aimed at targeting the high rates of negative. behavioral and emotional issues found among LGBT youth. This population&rsquo;s social identity as sexual minority individuals affects the way they interact with an anti-LGBT biased society, which in turn affect LGBT youth&rsquo;s perceptions of themselves, or self-concept. Because compromised self-concept is a contributing factor to negative outcomes, this psychological construct is the target of this intervention. This paper also discusses the myriad issues that should be taken into account when conducting an intervention with a marginalized population, including program design, intervention and research methods, staffing, and rules regarding participation. The result is a creativity-based intervention that uses artistic skills as well as group discussion to explore self-concept as LGBT individuals; the results of this program can produce meaningful research on self-concept and the internalization of social bias in LGBT populations as well as how interventions can better serve marginalized populations.    Lillian Sindisiwe Nkhwashu Child Support Grant: Teenage Mothers&rsquo; Perceptions and Selected Characteristics    This study used survey research design to better understand the perceptions that female teenagers have on the implementation of Child Support Grant in relation to their life goals, social support, and decision-making regarding self. The study also explores the link that exists between teenage motherhood and Child Support Grant as perceived by female teenagers. It further describes teenage motherhood as a way to elicit ways in which teenage mothers understand the implications of teenage motherhood in South Africa. Two hundred and fifty (250) African/Black teenage mothers and 250 African/Black teenage non&mdash;mothers ages I 8 and 19 years registered full-time for grades 1 I and 12 in 2013 academic year public schools of Limpopo province of South Africa completed a self&mdash;report survey. The study hypothesized that; 1) Child Support Grant is associated with teenagers becoming pregnant; 2) early motherhood is associated with school interruption; and 3) early pregnancy interferes with life goals. The findings indicate that Child Support Grant is associated with dependency, is related to early pregnancy, and it is associated with school interruption; however, as this is a cross&mdash;sectional study, the directionality cannot be determined.       Kelly O&rsquo;Connor Sports in the Lives of Adolescent Girls       Previous research has shown sports to be an influential factor contributing to the development of not only athleticism, but also academic achievement, socialization processes, and the cultivation of social skills. Through sports, participants develop skills, habits, and values that are then transferable to other areas of life by integrating them into a larger social network of additional peers and adults. Research suggests that girls who participate in sports during school&mdash;aged years experience positive outcomes in the areas of academics and physical and mental health, and also have been found to identify relationships to be key aspects of their sporting experience, yet few studies examine the meaning of sports in the lives of such participants. The present study draws on interview data from 23 racially and ethnically diverse eighth grade girls who play sports to determine what meaning they make of sports in the context of their lives. Findings indicate that sports enhance friendships and aid in the development of girls&rsquo; awareness of gender discrimination. Implications for future research are discussed.       Justin Preston &ldquo;If They Abduct You, You Don&rsquo;t Come Back:&rdquo; Understanding the Child Soldier in Their Own Words       The investigator will be using narratives collected from northern Uganda that were created through the course of NET. The researcher conducting the analysis in the present study did not have any role in the creation and collection of the trauma narratives. There are few considerations in the literature of understanding how the children themselves reconstruct their time within the LRA and subsequent return to civil society, and there is even less directed towards the child soldier prior to their abduction. Life before the traumatic events experienced while a member of the rebel groups is rarely included in analysis, when life prior to the abduction is critical in helping to determine future development (Annan et al., 2009; Omstein, 2012). Much of the literature has only just begun to address the subjective experiences of the child soldiers themselves (e. g. Barber, 2009; Betancourt &amp; Khan, 2008; Boothby, Crawford, &amp; Mamade, 2009; Oloya, 2011; Wessells, 2006), and the majority of this research has focused on interventions at the level of the secondary and tertiary needs of the children themselves as well as focusing on assessing levels of PTSD in the population. The purpose of conducting this qualitative analysis of the life narratives of former child soldiers was to provide a better understanding of their experience of their past. There are two questions this research hoped to answer by studying and analyzing autobiographical narratives. These questions are largely exploratory in nature: 1) What are some themes that emerge across the narratives? 2) Do aspects of the children&rsquo;s pre-abduction experiences play a role in later portions of their narratives? By looking at the child in the larger context of their life narratives, this research expects to identify and discuss several qualitative themes that will help to elucidate and describe the psychological experiences of the children across the entire lifespan. This study will focus on their experiences within the LRA as well as before and after.       Emerald Shee The Development of Emotion Understanding in Ethnically Diverse Children at Ages Four and Five       Emotion understanding is the ability to identify the emotional meaning of others&rsquo; emotional expressions, demonstrated through nonverbal and verbal behaviors, which is essential for participation in society. However, little is known about the developmental course of emotion understanding in young children from ethnically diverse, low-income backgrounds even though they are often at risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The current study utilizes a pretend play assessment paradigm to examine the development of emotion understanding among Dominican-American, African American, Chinese-American, and Mexican-American children at ages four and five. Children were presented with six scenarios in which they had to label and reason about stipulated emotional states and emotions experienced by a protagonist. Children&rsquo;s emotion understanding was based on two criteria: whether children could label the valence and whether children could select the correct prop to annul the stipulated scenarios. These were examined across development and for gender and ethnic differences. Overall children improved in their emotion understanding from age four to age five, demonstrating the highest level of emotion understanding through labeling the valence of the stipulated scenarios. Girls were better than boys in labeling the valence. Chinese-American children demonstrated worse competency in emotion understanding compared to the other three groups. Between the two ages tested, children from each ethnic background followed a similar developmental trajectory in their ability to understand others&rsquo; emotional states and emotions. Even though, there are similar patterns demonstrated across groups, there are still specific ethnic and gender differences, which are important to explore further in the future.       Pei-Chen Tsai Exploration of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People&rsquo;s Disclosure, Risk, and Mental Health in the Workplace       Recently, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population has become more visible in American society and across the world. Although American society has started to pay more attention to LGBT people&rsquo;s rights and mental health, they remain stigmatized and invisible in certain areas most notably in the workplace. Most LGBT workers choose to stay in the closet (i.e., conceal one&rsquo;s sexual orientation/gender identity) because they are not sure whether the work environment is safe and whether disclosing their sexual orientation will jeopardize their careers or not. The purpose of this study was to: 1. Use data collected from a sample of LGBT older adults (ages 60 to 88) from the United States to examine relationships among personal factors (ethnicity, level of education, and income), experiences of discrimination (at/outside work), personal mental health (self-esteem and depression), and a major coping strategy (disclosure) in the workplace. 2. To interpret the results from the current analyses and review existing literature to provide information about participants&rsquo; experiences of dealing with disclosure in the workplace and its consequence in terms of mental health. Results indicate that sexual orientation disclosure status at work is correlated with one&rsquo;s disclosure status outside of work, as well as one&rsquo;s experiences of victimization outside of work. In terms of mental health, unexpectedly, there was no significant correlation between either victimization at work and depression or between victimization at work and self-esteem.    Angel Venegas Improving Communication of Certified Nursing Assistants with Older Adult Males in Nursing Homes: Reducing Elderspeak       American nursing homes are in dire need of re-evaluating the quality of care they provide to the rapidly growing aging population. This is further supported by numerous studies that indicate that the majority of certi\ufb01ed nursing assistants (CNA) lack training, as evidenced by the few evidence&mdash;based interventions employed to educate them on gender differences in providing care to residents. Consequently, communication is a critical component overlooked in the process. In chapter one, background information regarding aging and nursing homes in the United States is discussed. Also, emphasis is placed on older adult males, certified nursing assistants, and elderspeak &mdash; the faulty communication style that is prevalent between them in the nursing home setting. Chapters two and three present the Certified Nursing Assistant Certified Communication Educational Program as a conceivable intervention to remedy this issue, and groundwork for possible further examination and use within the nursing home setting.       Danielle A. Wright The Development Process of Health Interventions to Promote Physical Activity Among Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review       Lifestyle interventions that promote healthy behaviors have the potential to reduce adverse effects of cancer treatments and improve overall quality of life in cancer patients. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of physical activity interventions for cancer patients and to assess the methodological design and implementation strategies of these of interventions. Relevant literature from published, peer-reviewed articles was utilized to address the aim of this review. Initial key search terms included: cancer AND lifestyle behavior, health behavior, exercise, physical activity, physical fitness, intervention, development, process, framework, and designing. Data was extracted and coded for characteristics of participants, objectives, theoretical framework, intervention design/methods, intervention delivery, outcome measures, and results. Study quality was assessed using a standardized measure. Fourteen articles representing 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Delivery methods included training sessions and telephone based counseling, and the majority of studies incorporated a theoretical basis. Intervention Mapping strategies were often implicitly stated in the studies. Significant differences in both physical activity behaviors and quality of life outcomes were found in three studies with mixed findings in five of the studies. One study did not show significance in either physical activity or quality of life and one study only presented the study protocol. Designing health interventions that integrate strategic intervention planning and community participation may have strong indications for creating health communications that would be adopted in practice and target vulnerable populations.

To what extent are these gendered distinctions also seen in diverse ethnic groups? How are they expressed? In this study, gender role beliefs and values of African-American (AA), Dominican-American (DA), and Mexican-American (MA) mothers were examined using qualitative methods. What gender role beliefs and expectations do AA, DA, and MA mothers hold for their children? Participants included 5 AA, 6 DA, and 7 MA mothers whose children were between 8 months and 2 years of age. Mothers of boys and mothers of girls were asked a series of open-ended questions about their experiences in raising their children. Their responses were transcribed and analyzed for thematic content. 12 themes emerged from the interviews, and were divided into three broad categories: child characteristics, parenting, and other gender domains. These themes were expressed by mothers of all three ethnicities. Themes for child characteristics were 1) Compliance vs. Defiance, 2) Gentleness vs. Roughness, 3) Emotional Sensitivity vs. Emotional Stoicism, and 4) Attachment vs. Independence. Themes for parenting were 5) Mother Role vs. Father Role, 6) Soft Hands vs. Harsh Forms of Discipline, 7) Educational Hopes vs. Educational Fears, and 8) Protection. Themes expressed in other areas included gendered beliefs about Appearance, Activities, and Status/Values. Knowledge of gender role beliefs can help provide a better understanding of parents&rsquo; behavior and their socio-culturally specific ways of socializing gender with their children.       Jessica Burdick Evaluating the Iowa Gambling Task as a Direct Assessment of Impulsivity with Elementary School-Aged Children       The goal of this study is to evaluate the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson, 1994) as a direct assessment measure of impulsivity among low-income elementary school-aged children. One hundred and ninety-three 9-11 year olds participating in a longitudinal intervention study performed a computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task, a validated measure of decision-making. Multi-level modeling was used to examine children&rsquo;s performance over the course of the task. In addition, age and gender were included in the models to determine whether student characteristics differentiated performance. Finally, teachers&rsquo; ratings of child impulsivity (BIS-11; Patton, Stanford, &amp; Barratt, 1995) were used to predict children&rsquo;s Iowa Gambling performance. Though previous research has found age and gender differences in IGT performance, results indicated no significant variation in IGT index scores across age or gender. Higher BIS scores, however, predicted a decrease in slope of Iowa Gambling performance, indicating students rated higher on impulsivity chose more disadvantageously across the task blocks. Results support evidence of the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task as a measure of impulsivity in low-income minority children.       Xinyue Guan Parent Involvement in Chinese Adolescents       Parent involvement is an important predictor of students&rsquo; academic achievement. However, little is known about the correlation between parent involvement and students&rsquo; academic achievement in mainland China. The current study aimed to examine parent involvement during the middle school years in the context of China. Seven hundred and ten 7th grade adolescents from three middle schools in Nanjing China and their mothers took part in the study as a part of the larger Nanjing Metropolitan Youth Project. Analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between maternal education, parent involvement, and students&rsquo; academic achievement. Results showed that students with mothers who had a college diploma or above reported more parent involvement than students with mothers who had a middle school diploma or lower. Perceived parent involvement did not directly predict students&rsquo; academic achievement; but the association was moderated by school type. Higher levels of perceived parent involvement were associated with higher students&rsquo; academic achievement in middle achieving school but not in low achieving school. The effects of gender and school type on students&rsquo; academic achievement are discussed.       Elise M. Harris An Exploration of the Relationship Between Interpersonal Forgiveness and Communalism Among African-American Adults       Scholars acknowledge that culture has implications for how people forgive interpersonally. However, few studies have investigated the role that cultural orientation may play in forgiveness among African American adults. The present study uses hierarchical regression to test empirically a model that explores the relative contributions of socio-demographic variables, domains of religiosity, empathy and comrnunalism to predicting interpersonal forgiveness among a sample of 241 adult African American men and women (ages 16-75). One&mdash;way ANOVAS revealed that participants with household incomes $70,000 and above had signi\ufb01cantly higher forgiveness mean scores than participants with household incomes $39,000 and below. Results of bivariate correlational analysis reveal that communalism, subjective religiosity, and empathic concern were signi\ufb01cantly and positively related to interpersonal forgiveness. Finally, a four step hierarchical regression model was conducted to determine if communalism is predictive of interpersonal forgiveness above and beyond socio&mdash;demographic variables, empathy and religiosity indices. The \ufb01ndings revealed that communalism is not a statistically signi\ufb01cant predictor of interpersonal forgiveness. However, subjective religiosity and empathy were signi\ufb01cant positive predictors of interpersonal forgiveness. Implications of these \ufb01ndings are discussed.       Emily Jacobson The Associations Between Risk and Protective Factors and Children&rsquo;s Academic Performance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)       Research shows that the presence of one or more risk factors is negatively associated with children&rsquo;s academic performance (Gutrnan, Sameroff, &amp; Cole, 2003). It has also been found that risk factors tend to cluster within individuals, and that the number of risk factors to which a child is exposed is sometimes more strongly associated with negative outcomes than the particular type of risk (Sameroff, Seifer, Barocas, Zax, &amp; Greenspan, 1987). Nonetheless, not every child exposed to risk develops negative outcomes. While certain factors have been studied as protective mechanisms for at-risk children (Ryzin, 2011), few studies to date have examined the cumulative effects of protective factors and hardly any research has considered their associations with academic outcomes (Van der Lann, Veenstra, Bogaerts, Verhulst, &amp; Ormel 2010), especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of existing literature on risk and protection comes from developed countries. The current study focuses on an understudied population of children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This study examines two risk/protection models, an individual model and a cumulative model, for predicting aspects of Congolese children&rsquo;s academic performance. The possibility that protective factors will moderate the negative association between risk factors and children&rsquo;s academic performance is also examined.       Juliana Karras Participant Research Engagement Within the Context of Evaluation Research       As funds available for social programs have decreased, criteria for program funding have become more rigorous (Paulsell, Avellar, Martin, &amp; Del Grosso, 2010), often requiring programs to demonstrate their practice is &ldquo;evidence&mdash;based&rdquo; (U.S. DHHS, 2011). In response, program evaluation research has proliferated (Donaldson, Christie, &amp; Mark, 2009). Traditionally, evaluation research focuses on participant engagement with program services. Within the context of an NYC program evaluation, authors theorize about the in\ufb02uence research processes have on participant engagement. A conceptual model is introduced which builds on the traditional notion of engagement in program services, by investigating what factors predict engagement with research. Logistical regression was use to examine whether baseline data collection was predicted by: (1) time lapse between communication with participants; (2) participant recruitment method; and (3) sample demographics (e.g. parent origin). Results suggest greater communication time&mdash;lapses negatively predicted baseline data collection, which indicate that research processes influence evaluation research.       Emily McFarlane   Designing an Intervention for LGBT Youth: The Role of Social Identity and Self-Concept       This paper presents a design for an intervention aimed at targeting the high rates of negative. behavioral and emotional issues found among LGBT youth. This population&rsquo;s social identity as sexual minority individuals affects the way they interact with an anti-LGBT biased society, which in turn affect LGBT youth&rsquo;s perceptions of themselves, or self-concept. Because compromised self-concept is a contributing factor to negative outcomes, this psychological construct is the target of this intervention. This paper also discusses the myriad issues that should be taken into account when conducting an intervention with a marginalized population, including program design, intervention and research methods, staffing, and rules regarding participation. The result is a creativity-based intervention that uses artistic skills as well as group discussion to explore self-concept as LGBT individuals; the results of this program can produce meaningful research on self-concept and the internalization of social bias in LGBT populations as well as how interventions can better serve marginalized populations.

To what extent are these gendered distinctions also seen in diverse ethnic groups? How are they expressed? In this study, gender role beliefs and values of African-American (AA), Dominican-American (DA), and Mexican-American (MA) mothers were examined using qualitative methods. What gender role beliefs and expectations do AA, DA, and MA mothers hold for their children? Participants included 5 AA, 6 DA, and 7 MA mothers whose children were between 8 months and 2 years of age. Mothers of boys and mothers of girls were asked a series of open-ended questions about their experiences in raising their children. Their responses were transcribed and analyzed for thematic content. 12 themes emerged from the interviews, and were divided into three broad categories: child characteristics, parenting, and other gender domains. These themes were expressed by mothers of all three ethnicities. Themes for child characteristics were 1) Compliance vs. Defiance, 2) Gentleness vs. Roughness, 3) Emotional Sensitivity vs. Emotional Stoicism, and 4) Attachment vs. Independence. Themes for parenting were 5) Mother Role vs. Father Role, 6) Soft Hands vs. Harsh Forms of Discipline, 7) Educational Hopes vs. Educational Fears, and 8) Protection. Themes expressed in other areas included gendered beliefs about Appearance, Activities, and Status/Values. Knowledge of gender role beliefs can help provide a better understanding of parents&rsquo; behavior and their socio-culturally specific ways of socializing gender with their children.       Jessica Burdick Evaluating the Iowa Gambling Task as a Direct Assessment of Impulsivity with Elementary School-Aged Children       The goal of this study is to evaluate the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson, 1994) as a direct assessment measure of impulsivity among low-income elementary school-aged children. One hundred and ninety-three 9-11 year olds participating in a longitudinal intervention study performed a computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task, a validated measure of decision-making. Multi-level modeling was used to examine children&rsquo;s performance over the course of the task. In addition, age and gender were included in the models to determine whether student characteristics differentiated performance. Finally, teachers&rsquo; ratings of child impulsivity (BIS-11; Patton, Stanford, &amp; Barratt, 1995) were used to predict children&rsquo;s Iowa Gambling performance. Though previous research has found age and gender differences in IGT performance, results indicated no significant variation in IGT index scores across age or gender. Higher BIS scores, however, predicted a decrease in slope of Iowa Gambling performance, indicating students rated higher on impulsivity chose more disadvantageously across the task blocks. Results support evidence of the validity of the Iowa Gambling Task as a measure of impulsivity in low-income minority children.       Xinyue Guan Parent Involvement in Chinese Adolescents       Parent involvement is an important predictor of students&rsquo; academic achievement. However, little is known about the correlation between parent involvement and students&rsquo; academic achievement in mainland China. The current study aimed to examine parent involvement during the middle school years in the context of China. Seven hundred and ten 7th grade adolescents from three middle schools in Nanjing China and their mothers took part in the study as a part of the larger Nanjing Metropolitan Youth Project. Analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between maternal education, parent involvement, and students&rsquo; academic achievement. Results showed that students with mothers who had a college diploma or above reported more parent involvement than students with mothers who had a middle school diploma or lower. Perceived parent involvement did not directly predict students&rsquo; academic achievement; but the association was moderated by school type. Higher levels of perceived parent involvement were associated with higher students&rsquo; academic achievement in middle achieving school but not in low achieving school. The effects of gender and school type on students&rsquo; academic achievement are discussed.       Elise M. Harris An Exploration of the Relationship Between Interpersonal Forgiveness and Communalism Among African-American Adults       Scholars acknowledge that culture has implications for how people forgive interpersonally. However, few studies have investigated the role that cultural orientation may play in forgiveness among African American adults. The present study uses hierarchical regression to test empirically a model that explores the relative contributions of socio-demographic variables, domains of religiosity, empathy and comrnunalism to predicting interpersonal forgiveness among a sample of 241 adult African American men and women (ages 16-75). One&mdash;way ANOVAS revealed that participants with household incomes $70,000 and above had signi\ufb01cantly higher forgiveness mean scores than participants with household incomes $39,000 and below. Results of bivariate correlational analysis reveal that communalism, subjective religiosity, and empathic concern were signi\ufb01cantly and positively related to interpersonal forgiveness. Finally, a four step hierarchical regression model was conducted to determine if communalism is predictive of interpersonal forgiveness above and beyond socio&mdash;demographic variables, empathy and religiosity indices. The \ufb01ndings revealed that communalism is not a statistically signi\ufb01cant predictor of interpersonal forgiveness. However, subjective religiosity and empathy were signi\ufb01cant positive predictors of interpersonal forgiveness. Implications of these \ufb01ndings are discussed.       Emily Jacobson The Associations Between Risk and Protective Factors and Children&rsquo;s Academic Performance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)       Research shows that the presence of one or more risk factors is negatively associated with children&rsquo;s academic performance (Gutrnan, Sameroff, &amp; Cole, 2003). It has also been found that risk factors tend to cluster within individuals, and that the number of risk factors to which a child is exposed is sometimes more strongly associated with negative outcomes than the particular type of risk (Sameroff, Seifer, Barocas, Zax, &amp; Greenspan, 1987). Nonetheless, not every child exposed to risk develops negative outcomes. While certain factors have been studied as protective mechanisms for at-risk children (Ryzin, 2011), few studies to date have examined the cumulative effects of protective factors and hardly any research has considered their associations with academic outcomes (Van der Lann, Veenstra, Bogaerts, Verhulst, &amp; Ormel 2010), especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of existing literature on risk and protection comes from developed countries. The current study focuses on an understudied population of children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This study examines two risk/protection models, an individual model and a cumulative model, for predicting aspects of Congolese children&rsquo;s academic performance. The possibility that protective factors will moderate the negative association between risk factors and children&rsquo;s academic performance is also examined.       Juliana Karras Participant Research Engagement Within the Context of Evaluation Research       As funds available for social programs have decreased, criteria for program funding have become more rigorous (Paulsell, Avellar, Martin, &amp; Del Grosso, 2010), often requiring programs to demonstrate their practice is &ldquo;evidence&mdash;based&rdquo; (U.S. DHHS, 2011). In response, program evaluation research has proliferated (Donaldson, Christie, &amp; Mark, 2009). Traditionally, evaluation research focuses on participant engagement with program services. Within the context of an NYC program evaluation, authors theorize about the in\ufb02uence research processes have on participant engagement. A conceptual model is introduced which builds on the traditional notion of engagement in program services, by investigating what factors predict engagement with research. Logistical regression was use to examine whether baseline data collection was predicted by: (1) time lapse between communication with participants; (2) participant recruitment method; and (3) sample demographics (e.g. parent origin). Results suggest greater communication time&mdash;lapses negatively predicted baseline data collection, which indicate that research processes influence evaluation research.       Emily McFarlane   Designing an Intervention for LGBT Youth: The Role of Social Identity and Self-Concept       This paper presents a design for an intervention aimed at targeting the high rates of negative. behavioral and emotional issues found among LGBT youth. This population&rsquo;s social identity as sexual minority individuals affects the way they interact with an anti-LGBT biased society, which in turn affect LGBT youth&rsquo;s perceptions of themselves, or self-concept. Because compromised self-concept is a contributing factor to negative outcomes, this psychological construct is the target of this intervention. This paper also discusses the myriad issues that should be taken into account when conducting an intervention with a marginalized population, including program design, intervention and research methods, staffing, and rules regarding participation. The result is a creativity-based intervention that uses artistic skills as well as group discussion to explore self-concept as LGBT individuals; the results of this program can produce meaningful research on self-concept and the internalization of social bias in LGBT populations as well as how interventions can better serve marginalized populations.    Lillian Sindisiwe Nkhwashu Child Support Grant: Teenage Mothers&rsquo; Perceptions and Selected Characteristics    This study used survey research design to better understand the perceptions that female teenagers have on the implementation of Child Support Grant in relation to their life goals, social support, and decision-making regarding self. The study also explores the link that exists between teenage motherhood and Child Support Grant as perceived by female teenagers. It further describes teenage motherhood as a way to elicit ways in which teenage mothers understand the implications of teenage motherhood in South Africa. Two hundred and fifty (250) African/Black teenage mothers and 250 African/Black teenage non&mdash;mothers ages I 8 and 19 years registered full-time for grades 1 I and 12 in 2013 academic year public schools of Limpopo province of South Africa completed a self&mdash;report survey. The study hypothesized that; 1) Child Support Grant is associated with teenagers becoming pregnant; 2) early motherhood is associated with school interruption; and 3) early pregnancy interferes with life goals. The findings indicate that Child Support Grant is associated with dependency, is related to early pregnancy, and it is associated with school interruption; however, as this is a cross&mdash;sectional study, the directionality cannot be determined.       Kelly O&rsquo;Connor Sports in the Lives of Adolescent Girls       Previous research has shown sports to be an influential factor contributing to the development of not only athleticism, but also academic achievement, socialization processes, and the cultivation of social skills. Through sports, participants develop skills, habits, and values that are then transferable to other areas of life by integrating them into a larger social network of additional peers and adults. Research suggests that girls who participate in sports during school&mdash;aged years experience positive outcomes in the areas of academics and physical and mental health, and also have been found to identify relationships to be key aspects of their sporting experience, yet few studies examine the meaning of sports in the lives of such participants. The present study draws on interview data from 23 racially and ethnically diverse eighth grade girls who play sports to determine what meaning they make of sports in the context of their lives. Findings indicate that sports enhance friendships and aid in the development of girls&rsquo; awareness of gender discrimination. Implications for future research are discussed.       Justin Preston &ldquo;If They Abduct You, You Don&rsquo;t Come Back:&rdquo; Understanding the Child Soldier in Their Own Words       The investigator will be using narratives collected from northern Uganda that were created through the course of NET. The researcher conducting the analysis in the present study did not have any role in the creation and collection of the trauma narratives. There are few considerations in the literature of understanding how the children themselves reconstruct their time within the LRA and subsequent return to civil society, and there is even less directed towards the child soldier prior to their abduction. Life before the traumatic events experienced while a member of the rebel groups is rarely included in analysis, when life prior to the abduction is critical in helping to determine future development (Annan et al., 2009; Omstein, 2012). Much of the literature has only just begun to address the subjective experiences of the child soldiers themselves (e. g. Barber, 2009; Betancourt &amp; Khan, 2008; Boothby, Crawford, &amp; Mamade, 2009; Oloya, 2011; Wessells, 2006), and the majority of this research has focused on interventions at the level of the secondary and tertiary needs of the children themselves as well as focusing on assessing levels of PTSD in the population. The purpose of conducting this qualitative analysis of the life narratives of former child soldiers was to provide a better understanding of their experience of their past. There are two questions this research hoped to answer by studying and analyzing autobiographical narratives. These questions are largely exploratory in nature: 1) What are some themes that emerge across the narratives? 2) Do aspects of the children&rsquo;s pre-abduction experiences play a role in later portions of their narratives? By looking at the child in the larger context of their life narratives, this research expects to identify and discuss several qualitative themes that will help to elucidate and describe the psychological experiences of the children across the entire lifespan. This study will focus on their experiences within the LRA as well as before and after.       Emerald Shee The Development of Emotion Understanding in Ethnically Diverse Children at Ages Four and Five       Emotion understanding is the ability to identify the emotional meaning of others&rsquo; emotional expressions, demonstrated through nonverbal and verbal behaviors, which is essential for participation in society. However, little is known about the developmental course of emotion understanding in young children from ethnically diverse, low-income backgrounds even though they are often at risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The current study utilizes a pretend play assessment paradigm to examine the development of emotion understanding among Dominican-American, African American, Chinese-American, and Mexican-American children at ages four and five. Children were presented with six scenarios in which they had to label and reason about stipulated emotional states and emotions experienced by a protagonist. Children&rsquo;s emotion understanding was based on two criteria: whether children could label the valence and whether children could select the correct prop to annul the stipulated scenarios. These were examined across development and for gender and ethnic differences. Overall children improved in their emotion understanding from age four to age five, demonstrating the highest level of emotion understanding through labeling the valence of the stipulated scenarios. Girls were better than boys in labeling the valence. Chinese-American children demonstrated worse competency in emotion understanding compared to the other three groups. Between the two ages tested, children from each ethnic background followed a similar developmental trajectory in their ability to understand others&rsquo; emotional states and emotions. Even though, there are similar patterns demonstrated across groups, there are still specific ethnic and gender differences, which are important to explore further in the future.       Pei-Chen Tsai Exploration of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People&rsquo;s Disclosure, Risk, and Mental Health in the Workplace       Recently, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population has become more visible in American society and across the world. Although American society has started to pay more attention to LGBT people&rsquo;s rights and mental health, they remain stigmatized and invisible in certain areas most notably in the workplace. Most LGBT workers choose to stay in the closet (i.e., conceal one&rsquo;s sexual orientation/gender identity) because they are not sure whether the work environment is safe and whether disclosing their sexual orientation will jeopardize their careers or not. The purpose of this study was to: 1. Use data collected from a sample of LGBT older adults (ages 60 to 88) from the United States to examine relationships among personal factors (ethnicity, level of education, and income), experiences of discrimination (at/outside work), personal mental health (self-esteem and depression), and a major coping strategy (disclosure) in the workplace. 2. To interpret the results from the current analyses and review existing literature to provide information about participants&rsquo; experiences of dealing with disclosure in the workplace and its consequence in terms of mental health. Results indicate that sexual orientation disclosure status at work is correlated with one&rsquo;s disclosure status outside of work, as well as one&rsquo;s experiences of victimization outside of work. In terms of mental health, unexpectedly, there was no significant correlation between either victimization at work and depression or between victimization at work and self-esteem.    Angel Venegas Improving Communication of Certified Nursing Assistants with Older Adult Males in Nursing Homes: Reducing Elderspeak       American nursing homes are in dire need of re-evaluating the quality of care they provide to the rapidly growing aging population. This is further supported by numerous studies that indicate that the majority of certi\ufb01ed nursing assistants (CNA) lack training, as evidenced by the few evidence&mdash;based interventions employed to educate them on gender differences in providing care to residents. Consequently, communication is a critical component overlooked in the process. In chapter one, background information regarding aging and nursing homes in the United States is discussed. Also, emphasis is placed on older adult males, certified nursing assistants, and elderspeak &mdash; the faulty communication style that is prevalent between them in the nursing home setting. Chapters two and three present the Certified Nursing Assistant Certified Communication Educational Program as a conceivable intervention to remedy this issue, and groundwork for possible further examination and use within the nursing home setting.       Danielle A. Wright The Development Process of Health Interventions to Promote Physical Activity Among Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review       Lifestyle interventions that promote healthy behaviors have the potential to reduce adverse effects of cancer treatments and improve overall quality of life in cancer patients. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of physical activity interventions for cancer patients and to assess the methodological design and implementation strategies of these of interventions. Relevant literature from published, peer-reviewed articles was utilized to address the aim of this review. Initial key search terms included: cancer AND lifestyle behavior, health behavior, exercise, physical activity, physical fitness, intervention, development, process, framework, and designing. Data was extracted and coded for characteristics of participants, objectives, theoretical framework, intervention design/methods, intervention delivery, outcome measures, and results. Study quality was assessed using a standardized measure. Fourteen articles representing 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Delivery methods included training sessions and telephone based counseling, and the majority of studies incorporated a theoretical basis. Intervention Mapping strategies were often implicitly stated in the studies. Significant differences in both physical activity behaviors and quality of life outcomes were found in three studies with mixed findings in five of the studies. One study did not show significance in either physical activity or quality of life and one study only presented the study protocol. Designing health interventions that integrate strategic intervention planning and community participation may have strong indications for creating health communications that would be adopted in practice and target vulnerable populations.

Way of the Center for Research on Culture, Development, and Education. Her research interests focus on (a) understanding how racial/ethnic dynamics influence individual's experiences across multiple settings including workplaces, classrooms, neighborhoods, and families, and (b) ethnic and cultural differences in parents' socialization goals, beliefs, and practices, especially as these influence children's learning. Dr. Hughes conducts school and community based studies with adolescents and their parents using multiple methods (interviews, surveys, focus groups). In her most recent work. Dr. Hughes, Dr. Niobe Way, and their students followed two multi-ethnic cohorts of NYC early adolescents (and their mothers) from the time they entered middle school through their junior year of high school to understand how varied stressors and supports influenced academic and socio-emotional development over time. Hughes received her B.A. in Psychology and African American Studies from Williams College and her Ph.D. in Community and Developmental Psychology from the University of Michigan. She is former chair of the John d. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's sub-group on Diversity in Mid-Life and co-chair of the 14 member cross-university Study Group on Race, Culture, and ethnicity. Her research has been supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Coundation, the William T.
